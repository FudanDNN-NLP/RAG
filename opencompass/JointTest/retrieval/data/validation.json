Dilated fundoscopy reveals no abnormality. #### Questions\n\n  * What should the GP advise? * What is the diagnosis? * What are the associated risks? #### Answers\n\nAs the symptoms are acute the GP should arrange for an urgent ophthalmic assessment. The most likely diagnosis is a posterior vitreous detachment. With careful ophthalmoscopy, it will be possible to identify vitreous opacities in keeping with this diagnosis. The flashing lights are caused by traction of the detached vitreous gel on the retina. A specialized examination of the peripheral retina is needed. A tear may occur in the retina, which in turn may lead to a retinal detachment. Laser applied around the tear while it is flat can prevent retinal detachment (see Chapter 11). ### Case 4\n\nA 75-year-old woman attends the main casualty department with nausea and vomiting. She says that her right eye is painful and red and that her vision is blurred. She is long-sighted and wears glasses for near and distance vision. She is generally fit. There is no family history of medical problems. On examination, the casualty officer finds the vision to be reduced to counting fingers in the right eye.

(Data from _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ , 1954 ed, s.v. \"Bacteriology.\") Pathologists know that there are only so many ways that cells can look sick, because cellular reactions have a defined repertoire for manifesting malfunction. We have also learned a great deal over the past 100 years by correlating the appearance of dead tissue cells under the microscope with clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, studying dead tissue cells for clinical significance does not allow direct observation of the dynamic energy of living cells, systems, organisms, and communities. Although correlation of the appearance of stained tissue cells under a microscope to clinical conditions is a powerful concept in medicine, alternative forms of medicine appear to provide a path to study the energy of living systems for health and healing, perhaps before the development of overt disease, as so often encountered among the many \"functional complaints\" in modern medicine (see Chapter 2). # NUTRITION AND NATURAL PRODUCTS\n\nThe reliance on nutrition and natural products is fundamental to CAM and does not play merely a supportive or adjunctive role. Nutrients and plant products are taken into the body and incorporated in the most literal sense. They provide the body with energy in the form of calories and with the material resources to stay healthy and get well. Because the basic plan of the body, as a physical entity and as an energy system, evolves and exists in an ecological context, what the body needs it obtains from the environment in which it grew. Lao Tzu said that \"what is deeply rooted in nature cannot be uprooted.\"# PLANTS\n\nPlants are an important part of nature relative to health and a dominant part of the nature in which humans evolved.In addition to producing the oxygen that we breathe, plants are seen as sources of nutrients, medicines (e.g., phytochemicals), and essential oils (e.g., volatiles for inhalation and transdermal absorption); some systems also view plants as sources of vibrational energy.",

This is a group of cell lines geared toward growing influenza or other respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, swine fever, and enterovirus. \"We're basically going fishing,\" Peiris told his lab partner, K. H. Chan. \"Let's hope we catch some virus.\" Once the samples were prepared and sealed, they were placed in a slow-rotating incubator and then checked every few hours for signs of cellular damage. For thousands of years, scientists postulated the theory of infectious agents so tiny they could not be observed\u2014couldn't the \"bad humors\" and \"evil spirits\" of medieval times have been nothing more than a collective sense of dread at microorganisms so small they seemed to drift in the ether, as scientists would later discover airborne viruses actually did? By the late nineteenth century, the diverse microbial world of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi was established. But as early as 1840, the German anatomist Jacob Henle suggested the existence of microbes, so tiny they could not be observed even by the light microscope, that caused specific illnesses and diseases. Three men\u2014Louis Pasteur, who disproved the theory of spontaneous generation of organisms with his swan-necked flasks that kept yeasts pure; Robert Koch, who demonstrated that specific bacteria caused anthrax and tuberculosis; and Joseph Lister, who developed a technique for obtaining purer cultures of organisms\u2014were instrumental in pushing the study of microorganisms into the modern age. Most curious, however, was the simple filter to purify water perfected by Charles Chamberland, a collaborator of Louis Pasteur, which allowed for the development of modern virology.The filters took the form of hollow, unglazed porcelain cylinders with microscopic pores.The cylinders would be inserted into a tube connected to a hand pump; the entire contraption looked something like a miniature gasoline pump from the 1920s.",

What is still unclear is what provides a cancer stem cell its unique identity and how prevalent they are throughout tumor development. Indeed, in light of context-dependent plasticity the true prevalence of a cancer stem cell population at any one point in time may be irrelevant as this will be a dynamic and ever changing figure. Importantly, this dictates that classical clinical modes of detecting tumor types such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be inappropriate for quantifying cancer stem cell prevalence in this context. Nevertheless, the presence of this unique cell population does provide an important clinical target for therapeutic targeting. In addition to their clonogenic capacity cancer stem cells display many attributes that predispose to drug resistance such as enhanced DNA repair pathways, cellular dormancy, and the expression of multidrug resistance proteins. These faculties suggest that targeting this population may be problematic. Indeed many authors suggest that these attributes may suggest that cancer stem cells are the population responsible for disease recurrence after adjuvant therapy. Late systemic recurrence is not uncommon after apparent complete response. Clearly, for this to occur requires a small, drug resistant and highly clonogenic population to exist \u2013 just as cancer stem cells appear to be. It has been proposed however that given many cancer stem cell populations share a large number of molecular features with regular stem cells; direct targeting of these cells could lead to significant deleterious effects on the associated normal tissue homeostasis.Early reports had suggested that Dclk1 marked a putative quiescent intestinal stem cell population; however, others had argued that Dclk1 marked a rare terminally differentiated secretory cell type called a Tuft cell (May _et al._ , 2009; Gerbe _et al._ , 2009).Dclk1 expression has also been described in both murine and human intestinal tumors.",

Although I'm not a dermatologist and have never prescribed these drugs, the list of potential complications seems pretty serious to me and includes some systemic conditions.

BOILS\n\nA boil is a skin abscess in which pus accumulates just beneath the surface of an oil gland or hair follicle. Boils develop because of an internal process in which the body needs to rid itself of toxicity. The boil will start out as a small, hard, red bump. As days go by, it becomes more tender, fills with pus, forms a head, bursts open, and then drains. The pus consists of dead white blood cells that have died after killing bacteria. If a boil comes to a head and bursts, it expels the dead bacteria. Sometimes the boil will not burst, and the body will absorb the pus into the system. However, it is best to pop the core out so the boil will fully discharge all the material and resolve itself. If the boils are large, they are called carbuncles, which can leave scars.

Angioedema and anaphylaxis present similarly, are commonly confused for each other, but have differing pathophysiology and significantly different treatments. Simply, anaphylaxis is an acute allergen-mediated reaction, while angioedema is a vascular reaction. More specifically, anaphylaxis is a true systemic hypersensitivity IgE-mediated allergic inflammatory reaction. Angioedema, however, is considered a noninflammatory disease state during which intravascular fluid extravasates secondary to increased capillary permeability into the dermis or submucosa, most commonly in the face, upper airway, and gastrointestinal tract. This vascular reaction results in a deep well-demarcated and asymmetrical nonpitting edema in the subcutaneous dermis thought to be similar to the more superficial wheal-and-flare\u2013type reaction seen in allergic urticaria. Angioedema is most commonly idiopathic but can be ACE inhibitor induced, hereditary or acquired with C1-esterase deficiency. Anaphylaxis on the other hand is most commonly associated with adverse drug reactions and insect stings in adults and food hypersensitivities in children. Both angioedema and anaphylaxis can be life threatening ( _Table 154.1_). Table 154.1 Risk Factors to Developing Clinically Significant Angioedema\n\nThe mechanism for idiopathic (spontaneous) angioedema is not well understood. ACE inhibitor angioedema however, while rarer with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.7% in patients on pharmacotherapy, accounts for upward of 30% of cases seen in the emergency department. Angiotensin is a potent hormone that results in vasoconstriction and the stimulation of aldosterone causing blood pressure elevation. Bradykinin increases capillary permeability and is a potent vasodilator considered to be 10 times more effective than histamine.The subsequent accumulation of bradykinin most commonly results in bronchospasm, which results in a dry irritating \"hacking\" cough.The deposition of surplus bradykinin into airway and GI tissue is thought to precipitate clinically significant angioedema.",

Potential [HCO3\u2013] can be estimated from the increment (\u0394) in the AG (\u0394AG = patient's AG \u201310). It must be determined if the acid anion in plasma is metabolizable (i.e., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and lactate) or nonmetabolizable (anions that accumulate in chronic renal failure and after toxin ingestion). The latter requires return of renal function to replenish the [HCO3\u2013] deficit, a slow and often unpredictable process. Consequently, patients with a normal AG acidosis (hyperchloremic acidosis), a slightly elevated AG (mixed hyperchloremic and AG acidosis), or an AG attributable to a nonmetabolizable anion in the face of renal failure should receive alkali therapy, either PO (NaHCO3 or Shohl's solution) or IV (NaHCO3), in an amount necessary to slowly increase the plasma [HCO3\u2013] into the 20\u201322 mmol/L range. Controversy exists, however, in regard to the use of alkali in patients with a pure AG acidosis owing to accumulation of a metabolizable organic acid anion (ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis). In general, severe acidosis (pH < 7.10) warrants the IV administration of 50\u2013100 meq of NaHCO3, over 30\u201345 min, during the initial 1\u20132 h of therapy. Provision of such modest quantities of alkali in this situation seems to provide an added measure of safety, but it is essential to monitor plasma electrolytes during the course of therapy, because the [K+] may decline as pH rises.

Usually, by the time of the diagnosis, probands (the first individual diagnosed within a family) have severe impairment of the left ventricular systolic function. Affected relatives, on the other hand, can be asymptomatic with mild ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Increasingly, the diagnosis is being made on the basis of family screening of clinically asymptomatic relatives of DCM cases. Educated patients may request such screening on the basis of having an affected family member diagnosed with DCM.

Deep caries or a large restoration may indicate a high risk for fracture of the crown during extraction, which would complicate the procedure. A tooth with missing crown will require a special approach. Other factors to consider are tooth/root mobility. Ankylosis, which is often seen with infrapositioned primary teeth or teeth subjected to earlier trauma, often indicates a surgical approach for removal of the primary tooth or, with ankylotic infrapositioned permanent teeth in the anterior region, decoronation to preserve the alveolar bone crest in the anterior region should be chosen. It is also important to assess the status of the adjacent teeth to avoid damage to fragile teeth or teeth with large restorations. The clinical evaluation of the tooth to be removed is done in conjunction with a radiographic assessment. ## Preoperative Radiographic Examination\n\nRadiographic examination must always be carried out prior to extraction of teeth to evaluate the degree of difficulty of extraction. Root anatomy, presence of pathology in the root or surrounding bone, vital structures and relation to other roots, neighboring teeth and other factors such as ankylosis with replacement resorption or hypercementosis of the root are taken into consideration (Fig. 8.6). The most common radiograph is a good quality intraoral periapical radiograph.

If a hemorrhagic stroke is not massive and pressure within the brain is not very high, the outcome is likely to be better after than that after an ischemic stroke. Blood (in a hemorrhagic stroke) does not damage brain tissue as much as an inadequate supply of oxygen (in an ischemic stroke) does. Prevention\n\nPreventing strokes is preferable to treating them. The main strategy for preventing a first stroke is managing the major risk factors. High blood pressure (see High Blood Pressure) and diabetes (see Diabetes Mellitus) should be controlled. Cholesterol levels should be measured and, if high, lowered to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (see discussion of treatment of dyslipidemia). Smoking and use of amphetamines or cocaine should be stopped, and alcohol should be limited to no more than 2 drinks a day. Exercising regularly and, if overweight, losing weight help people control high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels.

In contrast to the intermittent nature of A delta sensations, C fibers usually produce persistent pain. Although many theories of pain have been discussed, the classic **gate control theory** by Melzack and Wall (1982) still forms the basis of what is believed by most pain researchers today. According to this theory, a gating mechanism occurs in the spinal cord. Nerve fibers (A delta and C fibers) transmit pain impulses from the periphery of the body. These impulses travel to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, specifically to the _substantia gelatinosa_ , where the gating mechanism occurs. When the gate is opened, pain impulses ascend to the brain; when the gate is closed, the impulses do not get through and pain is not perceived (Fig. 5-1). FIG. 5-1 The gate control theory of pain. Morphine-like substances called **endorphins** are released when the large-diameter nerve fibers are stimulated. These fibers close the gate and decrease pain transmission. This helps explain why many noninvasive pain management techniques work to relieve pain. Endorphins are thought to be a gene product, and producing them requires a stimulus to the brain. Similar gating mechanisms exist in the nerve fibers descending from the thalamus and cerebral cortex. These areas of the brain regulate thoughts and emotions, including beliefs and values.

Chromatin remodelling\n\nChromatin consists of DNA and basic proteins called histones, which provide the structural backbone of the chromosome. It has long been recognized that histones play a critical role in regulating the expression of genes and determine which genes are transcriptionally active and which ones are suppressed (silenced). The chromatin structure is highly organized as almost two metres of DNA have to be packed into each cell nucleus. Chromatin is made up of nucleosomes, which are particles consisting of 146 base pairs of DNA wound almost twice around an octamer of two molecules each of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.7 Expression and repression of genes is associated with remodelling of this chromatin structure by enzymatic modification of the core histone proteins, particularly by acetylation.

In the resting cell DNA is wound tightly around core histones, excluding the binding of the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which activates gene transcription and the formation of messenger RNA.Gene transcription only occurs when the chromatin structure is opened up, with unwinding of DNA so that RNA polymerase II and basal transcription complexes can now bind to DNA to initiate transcription.",

Avoid telling your doctor a long story about Aunt Rose's tinnitus, because you want your doctor to focus on _you_ and on the problem you are having right now. #### Physical Examination\n\nThe examination will focus on the head, neck, brain, and cardiovascular system. Your ENT will listen for pulsatile tinnitus using a stethoscope over the ear canal, major blood vessels of the head and neck, and the heart. He or she may put pressure on the blood vessels in your neck or ask you to turn your head and say whether these maneuvers change the loudness of your tinnitus. #### Hearing Tests\n\nYour hearing will be tested during your first visit. This test can provide important diagnostic information even if you do not suffer from hearing loss. Advanced testing can also detect pulsations of the eardrum. Specific tests for tinnitus include pitch matching to determine the frequency of your tinnitus, loudness matching to determine loudness of your tinnitus, and a test for _residual inhibition_. In the residual inhibition test, you will listen to a tone that is a little louder than your tinnitus for one minute. When the external tone is turned off, you will be asked if your tinnitus has become softer or gone away and to indicate when it returns to its usual state.Most people with subjective tinnitus will not require any imaging tests, but if your ENT is concerned about the possibility of a benign tumor, he or she may order an MRI.For those who have objective tinnitus, a CT scan or MRI is often necessary to rule out a benign middle ear tumor, vascular malformation, or stroke.",

In its typical pattern, the injury is the result of abnormally large forces causing wrist extension, ulnar deviation and supination at the carpal bones. In extreme situations seen with complete scapholunate rupture, the normal alignment between scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum is lost: a characteristic appearance of scapholunate dissociation is seen on plain radiographs. This injury pattern is seen in collision with the fellow sports personnel and fall on an outstretched hand, with the hand held in the above position at the time of the impact in both instances. (b)\n\nLunotriquetral injuries: Are less common compared to scapholunate injuries and usually do not progress to arthrosis and collapse of the architecture of proximal row of carpal bones. These injuries occur as the result of forces that cause wrist extension, radial deviation and pronation at the carpal bones. Unlike scapholunate ruptures, insufficiency of lunotriquetral ligament does not disrupt the normal alignment of the lunate and triquetrum due to presence of extrinsic dorsal and volar ulnar ligaments stabilizing these carpal bones.

Care should be taken when measuring blood gases to obtain the arterial blood sample without using excessive heparin. Blood for electrolytes and arterial blood gases should be drawn simultaneously prior to therapy, because an increase in [HCO3\u2013] occurs with metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Conversely, a decrease in [HCO3\u2013] occurs in metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. In the determination of arterial blood gases by the clinical laboratory, both pH and PaCO2 are measured, and the [HCO3\u2013] is calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This calculated value should be compared with the measured [HCO3\u2013] (total CO2) on the electrolyte panel. These two values should agree within 2 mmol/L. If they do not, the values may not have been drawn simultaneously, a laboratory error may be present, or an error could have been made in calculating the [HCO3\u2013]. After verifying the blood acid-base values, the precise acid-base disorder can then be identified. **CALCULATE THE ANION GAP** All evaluations of acid-base disorders should include a simple calculation of the AG; it represents those unmeasured anions in plasma (normally 10 to 12 mmol/L) and is calculated as follows: AG = Na+ \u2013(Cl\u2013 \\+ HCO3\u2013). The unmeasured anions include anionic proteins, (e.g., albumin), phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions. When acid anions, such as acetoacetate and lactate, accumulate in extracellular fluid, the AG increases, causing a high-AG acidosis. An increase in the AG is most often due to an increase in unmeasured anions and, less commonly, is due to a decrease in unmeasured cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium). In addition, the AG may increase with an increase in anionic albumin, because of either increased albumin concentration or alkalosis, which alters albumin charge.A fall in serum albumin by 1 g/dL from the normal value (4.5 g/dL) decreases the AG by 2.5 meq/L.Know the common causes of a high-AG acidosis (Table 38\u20133).",

It can detect any blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. A spinal tap is not done if doctors suspect that pressure within the skull is increased. Cerebral angiography (see Angiography) is done as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the site of the aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation causing the bleeding. Magnetic resonance angiography (see page 2041) or CT angiography (see page 2038) may be used instead.

The LX and their analogs exert important activities related to airway inflammation, asthma, arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disease, periodontal disease, kidney diseases and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and many other diseases/disorders where uncontrolled inflammation is a key mediator of disease pathogenesis (Figure 24-1). The synthesis of the lipoxins occurs via 3 distinct pathways, one of which is triggered via the actions of aspirin. The 2 \"classical\" pathways for the synthesis of the lipoxins are the result of the concerted actions of 15-LOX acting on arachidonic acid in epithelial cells (eg, airway epithelia) and 5-LOX in leukocytes or through the actions of 5-LOX in leukocytes followed by 12-LOX action in platelets (Figure 24-2).

Although there never was any evidence that Vioxx offered more effective pain relief, people were hopeful. Doctors were convinced that the digestive tract protection such drugs were supposed to provide would be well worthwhile. It wasn't until years later that studies revealed these drugs increased the risk of dying from heart attacks and strokes.,\n\nWhat can someone do for joint pain that undermines the quality of life? Despite the problems with NSAID pills, it is possible to use NSAIDs topically. They may kick in a bit more slowly with pain relief, but after two or three weeks, the relief they offer is pretty similar. The Food and Drug Administration has approved three forms of diclofenac to be applied to the skin on or near the sore joint: Voltaren Gel, Flector patch, and Pennsaid Topical Solution. Putting medicine on the skin might trigger a rash in sensitive individuals, but it is less likely to cause serious digestive tract problems. Adverse reactions are still possible, so patients using one of these topical pain medicines need to stay in touch with their physicians. Another approach that the doctor may offer a desperate patient is a steroid injection into the joint. Although this treatment often eases pain in the short term, it does not provide reliable long-term relief for tendinitis. Steroid injections may offer many patients relief from arthritis joint pain for a few months, but the pain relief appears to fade more quickly with each subsequent injection. If a steroid injection seems to be the best option to calm a painful joint, request that it be done under ultrasound guidance. This helps ensure that the medication gets where it belongs. Keep in mind, though, that corticosteroids can weaken tendons.Arthritis expert Joanne Jordan, MD, MPH, Herman and Louise Smith Distinguished Professor of Medicine and director of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina, reminds us that both doctors and patient make a big mistake if they overlook all the nondrug approaches that can be helpful.",

Endocrine or islet cell tumours may be treated with hormone therapy, in which specific hormones are used to stop or slow the growth of the cancer in the endocrine cells. Targeted drug therapies that block cellular processes driving cancer cell proliferation have been used in combination with chemotherapy in some pancreatic cancer patients. For example, a drug called erlotinib (Tarceva) blocks the activity of a kinase (a type of enzyme) associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which stimulates unregulated cell division when mutated in cancer cells. When erlotinib is given in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (Gemzar), an antimetabolite that inhibits the synthesis of genetic material in dividing cells, patient survival is improved, although only modestly. Several other targeted drugs such as cetuximab (Erbitux), a monoclonal antibody that binds to EGFR and thus prevents kinase activation and cell division, are being developed and tested in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer. In most cases, pancreatic cancer cannot be completely prevented, but risk can be decreased by reducing or eliminating cigarette smoking and following a diet low in animal products and high in fruits and vegetables. Researchers are also investigating anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents that inhibit an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).

It does so by opening additional calcium channels in heart cell membranes. This speeds up the rate at which the sinus node cells fire, so that the heart rate is increased, and it also boosts the amount of calcium that is released from the intracellular stores and thereby enhances the strength of contraction. Adrenaline is made by the adrenal glands that lie just above the kidney, and is secreted into the bloodstream in response to stress or exercise; a related substance with a similar action, noradrenaline, is released from nerves that innervate the heart. Although an increased heart rate during exercise is essential in order to ensure that the limb muscles are adequately supplied with fuel and oxygen, too fast a rate is deleterious. This is because the heart muscles themselves cannot be supplied with oxygen fast enough. The consequence is angina \u2013 a severe incapacitating chest pain that can extend down the left arm. Angina is more easily precipitated in people whose coronary blood vessels are narrowed as a result of atherosclerotic plaques (fatty deposits in the vessel walls).

There are several studies that suggest antiresorptive treatment may lead to areas of bone necrosis and/or altered biomechanical integrity long before clinical ONJ presents [8\u201310]. Notably, empty osteocyte lacunae are found in cortical bone after long\u2010term treatment with zoledronate in the absence of clinical ONJ. This is one of the underlying premises supporting the categorization of stage 0 ONJ [4], yet similar findings have not been convincingly verified in humans. Suppression of bone turnover, through inhibition of osteoclastic activity, is at the core of the underlying necrosis and altered biomechanical integrity; however, suppression of bone turnover alone is not sufficient to cause ONJ. It is likely that inhibition of osteoclastic function compromises the ability of the alveolar bone to respond to extrinsic local factors and maintain a normal homeostasis [11]. Trauma features prominently in the pathogenesis of ONJ with 46% to 79% of ONJ patients having dentoalveolar trauma preceding ONJ clinical presentation, and specifically dental extraction [12]. Spontaneous incidence of ONJ may also be attributed to the trauma associated with normal masticatory function or dental prosthetic devices coupled with a very thin oral mucosa overlying the bone. Once the osseous tissue is exposed, infection is likely a key factor [13]. More than 750 species of bacteria are found in the oral cavity and comprise complex communities existing primarily in biofilms on the surfaces of teeth, prostheses, gingiva, and tongue [14]. The immune system reaction to oral microflora that are deleterious to wound healing coupled with compromised osseous integrity and the lack of osteoclastic remodeling may be particularly devastating for the development of clinical ONJ.Recent evidence suggests that bisphosphonate therapy results in significant differences in the expression of genes regulating immune function, barrier functions, tissue remodeling, and lymphangiogenesis [16, 17].",

Compared to other ALK TKIs, lorlatinib may have improved blood-brain barrier penetration due to its underlying mechanism. This increased ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier could potentially result in better efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) metastases, which commonly occur in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and significantly impact morbidity and quality of life.

In the context of determining the effectiveness of lorlatinib for people with ALK-positive NSCLC, the ECOG performance status can provide important information about a patient's prognosis and potential response to treatment.\n\nThe significance of the ECOG performance status lies in its association with disease progression and overall survival. Studies have shown that patients with a higher ECOG score tend to have poorer outcomes compared to those with lower scores. For example, individuals with an ECOG score of 2 may have more advanced disease or comorbidities that could impact their response to treatment.\n\nIn the case of lorlatinib, clinical evidence from the CROWN trial has shown favorable results for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. However, it is worth noting that this trial primarily included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, meaning they had good functional ability. This raises questions about how lorlatinib may perform in individuals with an ECOG score of 2, as there is limited data available specifically for this subgroup.\n\nGiven that the ECOG performance status is considered a prognostic variable, it is possible that lorlatinib may have different levels of effectiveness in patients with an ECOG score of 2 compared to those with lower scores. However, further research and evidence are needed to fully understand the impact of ECOG performance status on treatment outcomes with lorlatinib.\n\nIt is important for healthcare professionals to consider the individual patient's characteristics, including their ECOG performance status, when making treatment decisions.

It has been noted that lorlatinib, a medication being studied in one of these trials, may be less effective in people with an ECOG of 2. However, it is important to consider that this could also be the case for the comparator arm in the trial.\n\nMost individuals with an ECOG of 2 would likely respond quickly to treatment, resulting in an improvement in their ECOG performance status. Therefore, they may not meet the specific criteria for enrollment into a clinical trial as their condition improves before the trial begins.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the proportion of people with an ECOG of 0 or 1 in clinical trials of other medications like alectinib and brigatinib was similar to that observed in the lorlatinib trial. Additionally, lorlatinib's marketing authorization is not restricted by ECOG performance status.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many sites conducting the CROWN study are located in Asia, resulting in a higher proportion of participants from Asian family backgrounds compared to what would typically be seen in clinical practice in the UK. The possibility of family background being an effect modifier was explored through analysis of lorlatinib pharmacokinetics, which found no inherent differences between individuals with Asian and non-Asian family backgrounds.\n\nIn summary, clinical trials often recruit individuals with an ECOG performance status of only 0 or 1 due to selective recruitment processes.

This approach involved incorporating survival data from second-line studies to inform the estimation of PPS in the model. Specifically, the company utilized two external studies, PROFILE 1001/1005, which included two single-arm trials of crizotinib with individuals who had advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and received chemotherapy as a second-line treatment after progression on first-line lorlatinib. By incorporating this additional data, the revised model aimed to address concerns related to transparency, flexibility, and decision uncertainty raised by the Evidence Appraisal Group (EAG).",

This is particularly beneficial in the context of limited evidence base for overall survival data. The state-transition approach involves determining state occupancy based on transition probabilities applied to each health state, rather than relying solely on trial-derived survival curves. By explicitly modeling state-transition probabilities, this approach can overcome inconsistencies in available survival evidence, especially when the evidence is still immature. Additionally, the flexibility offered by the state-transition approach enables the incorporation of a wider range of treatments that people have after progression, making the model more aligned with real-world scenarios and NHS practice. Overall, using a state-transition approach improves the accuracy and reliability of modeling health states and transition probabilities when there is limited evidence available for overall survival data.\n\nReference: Study 1001 for survival with lorlatinib used second line after progression on first-line alectinib or brigatinib",

The EAG noted that although the company's evidence submission described this transition, it was not adequately reflected in their model. Additionally, during technical engagement, an error was identified where individuals in the progression-free survival state could not progress to death. The company acknowledged and rectified this error.

The company acknowledged that there was limited data available for this transition but believed more data would be available from future data cuts of CROWN.\n\nThe EAG considered several issues related to this situation. Firstly, given the available data, they felt that key transitions in a 4-state model cannot be appropriately represented. Secondly, there were limitations in how the company had modeled the rate of CNS progressions for specific treatments.

However, since the progression-free survival data from CROWN was not mature enough, the company used parametric curves fitted independently to each arm of CROWN to estimate the occupancy of the progression-free health state in the economic model. Additionally, they adjusted the crizotinib curve using hazard ratios from the NMA to calculate progression-free survival for alectinib and brigatinib. In modeling lorlatinib progression-free survival in the long term, the company chose to use an exponential curve.

This means that even after disease progression occurs, patients may continue to receive lorlatinib for a period of around 3 months. The reason for this is that chemotherapy, while a valid treatment option for ALK-positive NSCLC, can be associated with higher toxicity and negatively impact quality of life. Therefore, both patients and clinicians may be hesitant to suspend treatment with lorlatinib if it continues to provide some clinical benefit.

Clinical advice suggested that approximately 50% of people would continue on lorlatinib beyond disease progression at second line, and the treatment would typically continue for an average of 3 months. This expectation also applies to lorlatinib in a first-line position because there are currently no other ALK TKIs available after lorlatinib, and chemotherapy would be used as a second-line treatment.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no stopping rule for lorlatinib in its marketing authorization, and the decision to continue treatment beyond progression is made by clinicians in consultation with individuals with ALK-positive NSCLC. The company's model assumed that treatment duration would be the same as the period of progression-free survival and did not allow for treatment beyond progression.\n\nHowever, an exploratory scenario presented by the Evidence Appraisal Group (EAG) considered data from a retrospective analysis of Study 1001, which showed that 75.6% of people continued to receive lorlatinib after progressing on other ALK TKIs. In this study, the median additional duration of treatment beyond progression was 5.7 months. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund also expressed their belief that treatment with lorlatinib could extend beyond 3 months after disease progression.\n\nBased on these considerations, it was concluded that treatment with lorlatinib beyond disease progression could potentially last longer than the initial estimate provided by the company.
