He has treated hypertension but no other medical problems. The GP examines the eye and finds a normal visual acuity. Dilated fundoscopy reveals no abnormality. #### Questions\n\n  * What should the GP advise? * What is the diagnosis? * What are the associated risks? #### Answers\n\nAs the symptoms are acute the GP should arrange for an urgent ophthalmic assessment. The most likely diagnosis is a posterior vitreous detachment. With careful ophthalmoscopy, it will be possible to identify vitreous opacities in keeping with this diagnosis. The flashing lights are caused by traction of the detached vitreous gel on the retina. A specialized examination of the peripheral retina is needed. A tear may occur in the retina, which in turn may lead to a retinal detachment. Laser applied around the tear while it is flat can prevent retinal detachment (see Chapter 11). ### Case 4\n\nA 75-year-old woman attends the main casualty department with nausea and vomiting. She says that her right eye is painful and red and that her vision is blurred. She is long-sighted and wears glasses for near and distance vision. She is generally fit. There is no family history of medical problems. On examination, the casualty officer finds the vision to be reduced to counting fingers in the right eye. The eye is red, the cornea appears cloudy, and the pupil is oval and dilated on the affected side. No view of the fundus is obtained. #### Questions\n\n  * What is the diagnosis? * How might it be confirmed? * What is the treatment? #### Answers\n\nThe lady is long-sighted and has acute angle closure (see Chapter 10). Tonometry would reveal a raised intraocular pressure often has high as 60\u201370 mmHg (see Chapter 2). If possible through the cloudy cornea, gonioscopy would confirm the presence of a closed angle and a narrow angle in the fellow eye (see Chapter 10). This can also be seen using high resolution ultrasound or confocal microscopy.A peripheral iridotomy is then performed, usually with a YAG laser, in both eyes, to prevent further attacks.If she has cataracts then surgical replacement of her lenses with artificial intra-ocular lenses can also help to widen the drainage angle.### Case 5\n\nA 28-year-old man presents to his optician with a painful, red right eye.The vision has become increasingly blurred over the last 2 days.",

Figure 1-1 Relation between rate of cell division for _Bacillus mycoides_ and temperature. (Data from _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ , 1954 ed, s.v. \"Bacteriology.\") Pathologists know that there are only so many ways that cells can look sick, because cellular reactions have a defined repertoire for manifesting malfunction. We have also learned a great deal over the past 100 years by correlating the appearance of dead tissue cells under the microscope with clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, studying dead tissue cells for clinical significance does not allow direct observation of the dynamic energy of living cells, systems, organisms, and communities. Although correlation of the appearance of stained tissue cells under a microscope to clinical conditions is a powerful concept in medicine, alternative forms of medicine appear to provide a path to study the energy of living systems for health and healing, perhaps before the development of overt disease, as so often encountered among the many \"functional complaints\" in modern medicine (see Chapter 2). # NUTRITION AND NATURAL PRODUCTS\n\nThe reliance on nutrition and natural products is fundamental to CAM and does not play merely a supportive or adjunctive role. Nutrients and plant products are taken into the body and incorporated in the most literal sense. They provide the body with energy in the form of calories and with the material resources to stay healthy and get well. Because the basic plan of the body, as a physical entity and as an energy system, evolves and exists in an ecological context, what the body needs it obtains from the environment in which it grew. Lao Tzu said that \"what is deeply rooted in nature cannot be uprooted.\"# PLANTS\n\nPlants are an important part of nature relative to health and a dominant part of the nature in which humans evolved.In addition to producing the oxygen that we breathe, plants are seen as sources of nutrients, medicines (e.g., phytochemicals), and essential oils (e.g., volatiles for inhalation and transdermal absorption); some systems also view plants as sources of vibrational energy.",

This is a group of cell lines geared toward growing influenza or other respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, swine fever, and enterovirus. \"We're basically going fishing,\" Peiris told his lab partner, K. H. Chan. \"Let's hope we catch some virus.\" Once the samples were prepared and sealed, they were placed in a slow-rotating incubator and then checked every few hours for signs of cellular damage. For thousands of years, scientists postulated the theory of infectious agents so tiny they could not be observed\u2014couldn't the \"bad humors\" and \"evil spirits\" of medieval times have been nothing more than a collective sense of dread at microorganisms so small they seemed to drift in the ether, as scientists would later discover airborne viruses actually did? By the late nineteenth century, the diverse microbial world of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi was established. But as early as 1840, the German anatomist Jacob Henle suggested the existence of microbes, so tiny they could not be observed even by the light microscope, that caused specific illnesses and diseases. Three men\u2014Louis Pasteur, who disproved the theory of spontaneous generation of organisms with his swan-necked flasks that kept yeasts pure; Robert Koch, who demonstrated that specific bacteria caused anthrax and tuberculosis; and Joseph Lister, who developed a technique for obtaining purer cultures of organisms\u2014were instrumental in pushing the study of microorganisms into the modern age. Most curious, however, was the simple filter to purify water perfected by Charles Chamberland, a collaborator of Louis Pasteur, which allowed for the development of modern virology.The filters took the form of hollow, unglazed porcelain cylinders with microscopic pores.The cylinders would be inserted into a tube connected to a hand pump; the entire contraption looked something like a miniature gasoline pump from the 1920s.",

What is still unclear is what provides a cancer stem cell its unique identity and how prevalent they are throughout tumor development. Indeed, in light of context-dependent plasticity the true prevalence of a cancer stem cell population at any one point in time may be irrelevant as this will be a dynamic and ever changing figure. Importantly, this dictates that classical clinical modes of detecting tumor types such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be inappropriate for quantifying cancer stem cell prevalence in this context. Nevertheless, the presence of this unique cell population does provide an important clinical target for therapeutic targeting. In addition to their clonogenic capacity cancer stem cells display many attributes that predispose to drug resistance such as enhanced DNA repair pathways, cellular dormancy, and the expression of multidrug resistance proteins. These faculties suggest that targeting this population may be problematic. Indeed many authors suggest that these attributes may suggest that cancer stem cells are the population responsible for disease recurrence after adjuvant therapy. Late systemic recurrence is not uncommon after apparent complete response. Clearly, for this to occur requires a small, drug resistant and highly clonogenic population to exist \u2013 just as cancer stem cells appear to be. It has been proposed however that given many cancer stem cell populations share a large number of molecular features with regular stem cells; direct targeting of these cells could lead to significant deleterious effects on the associated normal tissue homeostasis.Early reports had suggested that Dclk1 marked a putative quiescent intestinal stem cell population; however, others had argued that Dclk1 marked a rare terminally differentiated secretory cell type called a Tuft cell (May _et al._ , 2009; Gerbe _et al._ , 2009).Dclk1 expression has also been described in both murine and human intestinal tumors.",

Recently, the FDA approved the use of _nonsteroidal_ medications, such as Pimecrolimus and Tacrolimus, to treat eczema. These drugs are approved for use in children two years and older. Although I'm not a dermatologist and have never prescribed these drugs, the list of potential complications seems pretty serious to me and includes some systemic conditions.

BOILS\n\nA boil is a skin abscess in which pus accumulates just beneath the surface of an oil gland or hair follicle. Boils develop because of an internal process in which the body needs to rid itself of toxicity. The boil will start out as a small, hard, red bump. As days go by, it becomes more tender, fills with pus, forms a head, bursts open, and then drains. The pus consists of dead white blood cells that have died after killing bacteria. If a boil comes to a head and bursts, it expels the dead bacteria. Sometimes the boil will not burst, and the body will absorb the pus into the system. However, it is best to pop the core out so the boil will fully discharge all the material and resolve itself. If the boils are large, they are called carbuncles, which can leave scars. If there is a lot of toxicity to expel, your child may develop a low-grade fever. If your child develops a boil, you should regard it as the immune system working to cleanse the body of unwanted toxins.

Angioedema and anaphylaxis present similarly, are commonly confused for each other, but have differing pathophysiology and significantly different treatments. Simply, anaphylaxis is an acute allergen-mediated reaction, while angioedema is a vascular reaction. More specifically, anaphylaxis is a true systemic hypersensitivity IgE-mediated allergic inflammatory reaction. Angioedema, however, is considered a noninflammatory disease state during which intravascular fluid extravasates secondary to increased capillary permeability into the dermis or submucosa, most commonly in the face, upper airway, and gastrointestinal tract. This vascular reaction results in a deep well-demarcated and asymmetrical nonpitting edema in the subcutaneous dermis thought to be similar to the more superficial wheal-and-flare\u2013type reaction seen in allergic urticaria. Angioedema is most commonly idiopathic but can be ACE inhibitor induced, hereditary or acquired with C1-esterase deficiency. Anaphylaxis on the other hand is most commonly associated with adverse drug reactions and insect stings in adults and food hypersensitivities in children. Both angioedema and anaphylaxis can be life threatening ( _Table 154.1_). Table 154.1 Risk Factors to Developing Clinically Significant Angioedema\n\nThe mechanism for idiopathic (spontaneous) angioedema is not well understood. ACE inhibitor angioedema however, while rarer with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.7% in patients on pharmacotherapy, accounts for upward of 30% of cases seen in the emergency department. Angiotensin is a potent hormone that results in vasoconstriction and the stimulation of aldosterone causing blood pressure elevation. Bradykinin increases capillary permeability and is a potent vasodilator considered to be 10 times more effective than histamine.The subsequent accumulation of bradykinin most commonly results in bronchospasm, which results in a dry irritating \"hacking\" cough.The deposition of surplus bradykinin into airway and GI tissue is thought to precipitate clinically significant angioedema.",

Potential [HCO3\u2013] can be estimated from the increment (\u0394) in the AG (\u0394AG = patient's AG \u201310). It must be determined if the acid anion in plasma is metabolizable (i.e., \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and lactate) or nonmetabolizable (anions that accumulate in chronic renal failure and after toxin ingestion). The latter requires return of renal function to replenish the [HCO3\u2013] deficit, a slow and often unpredictable process. Consequently, patients with a normal AG acidosis (hyperchloremic acidosis), a slightly elevated AG (mixed hyperchloremic and AG acidosis), or an AG attributable to a nonmetabolizable anion in the face of renal failure should receive alkali therapy, either PO (NaHCO3 or Shohl's solution) or IV (NaHCO3), in an amount necessary to slowly increase the plasma [HCO3\u2013] into the 20\u201322 mmol/L range. Controversy exists, however, in regard to the use of alkali in patients with a pure AG acidosis owing to accumulation of a metabolizable organic acid anion (ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis). In general, severe acidosis (pH < 7.10) warrants the IV administration of 50\u2013100 meq of NaHCO3, over 30\u201345 min, during the initial 1\u20132 h of therapy. Provision of such modest quantities of alkali in this situation seems to provide an added measure of safety, but it is essential to monitor plasma electrolytes during the course of therapy, because the [K+] may decline as pH rises.

Deep caries or a large restoration may indicate a high risk for fracture of the crown during extraction, which would complicate the procedure. A tooth with missing crown will require a special approach. Other factors to consider are tooth/root mobility. Ankylosis, which is often seen with infrapositioned primary teeth or teeth subjected to earlier trauma, often indicates a surgical approach for removal of the primary tooth or, with ankylotic infrapositioned permanent teeth in the anterior region, decoronation to preserve the alveolar bone crest in the anterior region should be chosen. It is also important to assess the status of the adjacent teeth to avoid damage to fragile teeth or teeth with large restorations. The clinical evaluation of the tooth to be removed is done in conjunction with a radiographic assessment. ## Preoperative Radiographic Examination\n\nRadiographic examination must always be carried out prior to extraction of teeth to evaluate the degree of difficulty of extraction. Root anatomy, presence of pathology in the root or surrounding bone, vital structures and relation to other roots, neighboring teeth and other factors such as ankylosis with replacement resorption or hypercementosis of the root are taken into consideration (Fig. 8.6). The most common radiograph is a good quality intraoral periapical radiograph. Other techniques, such as panoramic radiographs, scanograms, and cone-beam computer tomography, are more valuable to evaluate the tooth in relation to vital structures such as inferior alveolar nerve and maxillary sinus. Fig. 8.6 (a) Hypercementosis of the mesial root of the first lower left molar would prompt surgical extraction of this tooth. Closed extraction in this case is impossible. The second molar has a large restoration, and the tooth could be fragile leading to fracture.(b) The extent of external root resorption makes extraction of the canine almost impossible due to the risk for fracture.Surgical extraction should be considered.(c) The root configuration of the second lower right molar makes it impossible to remove this tooth without a surgical procedure.(d) The lower first right molar has slender roots that taper towards each other apically.",

In adults who have had an ischemic stroke, problems that remain after 6 months are likely to be permanent, but children continue to improve slowly for many months. Older people fare less well than younger people. For people who already have other serious disorders (such as dementia), recovery is more limited. If a hemorrhagic stroke is not massive and pressure within the brain is not very high, the outcome is likely to be better after than that after an ischemic stroke. Blood (in a hemorrhagic stroke) does not damage brain tissue as much as an inadequate supply of oxygen (in an ischemic stroke) does. Prevention\n\nPreventing strokes is preferable to treating them. The main strategy for preventing a first stroke is managing the major risk factors. High blood pressure (see High Blood Pressure) and diabetes (see Diabetes Mellitus) should be controlled. Cholesterol levels should be measured and, if high, lowered to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (see discussion of treatment of dyslipidemia). Smoking and use of amphetamines or cocaine should be stopped, and alcohol should be limited to no more than 2 drinks a day. Exercising regularly and, if overweight, losing weight help people control high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels. Having regular checkups enables a doctor to identify risk factors for stroke so that they can be managed quickly. If people have had an ischemic stroke, taking an antiplatelet drug can reduce the risk of another ischemic stroke. Antiplatelet drugs make platelets less likely to clump and form clots, a common cause of ischemic stroke.Aspirin, one of the most effective antiplatelet drugs, is usually prescribed.One adult's tablet or 1 children's tablet (which is about one fourth the dose of an adult aspirin) is taken each day.Either dose seems to prevent strokes about equally well.",

Finally, patients with Refsum disease are maintained on a diet with no phytanic acid (found in beef, lamb, tuna, cod, and haddock); attempts to find alternative/natural therapies are also ongoing. Finally, mitochondria are unable to degrade fatty acids greater than 22 carbons. In the case of **very-long-chain fatty acids** ( **VLCFA** ), breakdown occurs in peroxisomes, organelles found in all eukaryotes that provide specialized lipid metabolism as well as processing of toxic substances. Peroxisomes metabolize VLCFA down to an eight-carbon octanyl-CoA, which is then further processed by mitochondria as described above. Peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids is driven not by ATP but rather by the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a highly energized molecule, which is converted to water and oxygen by the enzyme catalase found only in peroxisomes. Similarly, though, the fatty acid substrate is transported into the peroxisome by a carnitine acyltransferase and the final step in the process is via a similar peroxisomal \u03b2-ketothiolase. ### **METABOLISM OF COMPLEX LIPIDS**\n\n#### **TRIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHESIS**\n\n**Triacylglycerols** , commonly referred to as triglycerides, are the predominant storage form of lipids (Chapter 3, Figure 3-2B.As noted previously, triacylglycerol stores 9 kcal/g versus only 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates.Synthesis of triacylglycerols mainly takes place on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver but can also be generated in adipose (fat) cells.",

It promotes acceptance and resilience. The second is mediated by the more sparse, less sticky 2A receptors and only kicks in when we are faced with extreme, life-threatening situations such as starvation, asphyxia or a lethal adversary. This second stress response promotes brain plasticity: the kind of radical, adaptive thinking that might ensure our long-term survival \u2013 assuming, of course, we live to fight another day. In the game of life, fine-tuning the balance between stability and plasticity to match circumstances is the key to success. Over the past decade, as we have learned more about the neuroscience of consciousness, a picture has started to emerge of how altered states \u2013 from dreams and trance to psychedelics and meditation \u2013 shift the balance in favour of change, shattering the dominance of established, conservative models of thought and behaviour: models that in their most intractable forms are responsible for conditions such as addiction, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the process, altered states make psychological growth and adaptation possible. We've seen how, for example, drugs such as LSD and psilocybin temporarily stifle alpha waves in the default mode network (DMN), dissolving the ego and promoting communication between brain regions and networks that aren't usually on talking terms, bringing alternative cognitive models to the fore. By contrast, years of committed meditation practice seem to work from the bottom-up, expanding consciousness by boosting gamma waves, opening up our senses and blurring the boundaries of bodily selfhood.In light of these recent advances in the scientific understanding of altered states \u2013 and consciousness itself \u2013 the future possibilities for medicine and society look exciting.We have an opportunity unprecedented in human history to harness altered states as part of safe, effective new treatments for mental illness and addiction, to enhance general well-being and ease our passing.",

(A) Liver (MP); (B) kidney (MP); (C) bone (MP); (D) tuberculous meningitis (MP).If a ruptured tuberculous lymph node (or a rapidly enlarging focus of post-primary tuberculosis) erodes a blood vessel wall, masses of mycobacteria are discharged into the circulation and lodge in the microvasculature. When the eroded vessel is a branch of the pulmonary artery, the organisms pass to other areas of the lung, but when a pulmonary venous tributary is involved, they are spread in the systemic circulation to many organs, notably the liver, kidney and spleen. In this way, vast numbers of new tubercles may be produced throughout the body. Such multiple lesions rarely attain any great size because this occurrence usually produces rapid clinical deterioration and death. Because the gross appearance of individual lesions resembles millet seeds, this condition is known as  miliary tuberculosis . Fig. 5.7A shows several miliary tubercles (T) in the liver (E-Fig. 5.4 H ). One of the tubercles exhibits Langhans' giant cells (L) and the larger tubercle shows early central caseous necrosis.It seems that a relatively small number of organisms can be disseminated by the bloodstream to various organs without causing overt disease, only to become reactivated at a later date when the host's immune status is impaired.

Microscopically, MCNs have an inner columnar epithelial layer and an outer, dense layer composed of ovarian-type stroma, which differentiates them from other cystic neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry of MCNs is frequently positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Macroscopically, MCNs appear as round cystic lesions with a smooth surface and fibrous pseudocapsule. Multiple loculi may be present (see Figure 3, _A_ _)_. On CT scan or MRI (see Figure 3, _B_ _),_ MCNs appear as round, well-encapsulated, septated, macrocystic tumors. Calcifications may be visualized within the wall of the tumor and occur more frequently in malignant MCNs. Similarly, mural nodules, biliary obstruction, invasion of vascular structures, extrapancreatic lesions, ascites, and obliteration of fat planes around the pancreas increase the likelihood of invasive malignancy within the MCN. ERCP shows an absence of pancreatic ductal communication in MCNs. An elevated cyst fluid CEA level strongly suggests a mucinous neoplasm (MCN or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [IPMN]) rather than a nonmucinous cyst, and MCNs with malignancy have even higher CEA levels compared with benign MCNs. A cyst fluid CA 19-9 level greater than 37 U/mL suggests a mucinous lesion (either cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma) rather than a serous cystadenoma or pseudocyst. Because of the risk of occult malignancy within the lesion and future malignant transformation, the treatment of choice for all MCNs is complete surgical resection. Laparoscopy can be used in patients with small MCNs (<4 cm) without mural nodules on imaging. Nonoperative management is only indicated in patients who cannot tolerate surgery.Prognosis is largely determined by the presence or absence of an invasive component.Recurrence after resection of benign MCN has been reported to be less than 5%, but this increases to as high as 37% in those with invasive carcinoma.",

                "text": "The gate control theory has helped nurses and other health care professionals recognize the _holistic_ nature of pain.When pain occurs, a person's thoughts and emotions can modify one's perceptions as they reach the level of conscious awareness.These areas of the brain regulate thoughts and emotions, including beliefs and values.Pain conduction from C fibers is slow, more diffuse (widespread) and dull, burning, or achy\u2014quite different from the sensations of A delta fibers. In contrast to the intermittent nature of A delta sensations, C fibers usually produce persistent pain. Although many theories of pain have been discussed, the classic **gate control theory** by Melzack and Wall (1982) still forms the basis of what is believed by most pain researchers today. According to this theory, a gating mechanism occurs in the spinal cord. Nerve fibers (A delta and C fibers) transmit pain impulses from the periphery of the body. These impulses travel to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, specifically to the _substantia gelatinosa_ , where the gating mechanism occurs. When the gate is opened, pain impulses ascend to the brain; when the gate is closed, the impulses do not get through and pain is not perceived (Fig. 5-1). FIG. 5-1 The gate control theory of pain. Morphine-like substances called **endorphins** are released when the large-diameter nerve fibers are stimulated. These fibers close the gate and decrease pain transmission. This helps explain why many noninvasive pain management techniques work to relieve pain. Endorphins are thought to be a gene product, and producing them requires a stimulus to the brain. Similar gating mechanisms exist in the nerve fibers descending from the thalamus and cerebral cortex. These areas of the brain regulate thoughts and emotions, including beliefs and values. When pain occurs, a person's thoughts and emotions can modify one's perceptions as they reach the level of conscious awareness. The gate control theory has helped nurses and other health care professionals recognize the _holistic_ nature of pain.### Attitudes and Practices Related to Pain\n\nThe attitudes of health care professionals toward pain influence the way they perceive and interact with patients in pain.Without adequate assessment skills or knowledge of pain and analgesic therapy, they may not be able to understand their patients' pain.",

NF-\u03baB may be activated by rhinovirus infection and allergen exposure, both of which exacerbate asthmatic inflammation. Chromatin remodelling\n\nChromatin consists of DNA and basic proteins called histones, which provide the structural backbone of the chromosome. It has long been recognized that histones play a critical role in regulating the expression of genes and determine which genes are transcriptionally active and which ones are suppressed (silenced). The chromatin structure is highly organized as almost two metres of DNA have to be packed into each cell nucleus. Chromatin is made up of nucleosomes, which are particles consisting of 146 base pairs of DNA wound almost twice around an octamer of two molecules each of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.7 Expression and repression of genes is associated with remodelling of this chromatin structure by enzymatic modification of the core histone proteins, particularly by acetylation. Each core histone has a long N-terminal tail that is rich in lysine residues, which may become acetylated, thus changing the electrical charge of the core histone. In the resting cell DNA is wound tightly around core histones, excluding the binding of the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which activates gene transcription and the formation of messenger RNA.Gene transcription only occurs when the chromatin structure is opened up, with unwinding of DNA so that RNA polymerase II and basal transcription complexes can now bind to DNA to initiate transcription.",

Hint: even if you have filled out a questionnaire, be sure to mention any of the above issues directly to the doctor or assistant who does the intake. Bring notes! Avoid telling your doctor a long story about Aunt Rose's tinnitus, because you want your doctor to focus on _you_ and on the problem you are having right now. #### Physical Examination\n\nThe examination will focus on the head, neck, brain, and cardiovascular system. Your ENT will listen for pulsatile tinnitus using a stethoscope over the ear canal, major blood vessels of the head and neck, and the heart. He or she may put pressure on the blood vessels in your neck or ask you to turn your head and say whether these maneuvers change the loudness of your tinnitus. #### Hearing Tests\n\nYour hearing will be tested during your first visit. This test can provide important diagnostic information even if you do not suffer from hearing loss. Advanced testing can also detect pulsations of the eardrum. Specific tests for tinnitus include pitch matching to determine the frequency of your tinnitus, loudness matching to determine loudness of your tinnitus, and a test for _residual inhibition_. In the residual inhibition test, you will listen to a tone that is a little louder than your tinnitus for one minute. When the external tone is turned off, you will be asked if your tinnitus has become softer or gone away and to indicate when it returns to its usual state.Most people with subjective tinnitus will not require any imaging tests, but if your ENT is concerned about the possibility of a benign tumor, he or she may order an MRI.For those who have objective tinnitus, a CT scan or MRI is often necessary to rule out a benign middle ear tumor, vascular malformation, or stroke.",

COUCH GRASS\n\nLatin names: _Elymus repens, Graminis rhizoma,_ or _Agropyron repens_ (Poaceae [haygrass] family)\n\nOther common names: dog grass, quackgrass\n\nGeneral Description\n\nCouch grass is an invasive weed found in the Americas, northern Asia, Australia, and Europe. It is similar to, and sometimes misidentified as, Johnson grass. A vigorous perennial growing to a height of three feet (one meter), couch grass has long, creeping rhizomes, slender leaves, and erect flower spikes bearing green flowers in two rows. The rhizome and the seeds are used in herbal medicine. Evidence of Benefit\n\nCouch grass is a rich source of healing mucilages that soothe and relieve inflamed sore throat. It has been used to treat difficult urination and kidney stones since the time of the Roman Empire. Benefits of couch grass for specific health conditions include the following:\n\n\u2022 _Kidney problems_. Couch grass is useful for inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract and for prevention of kidney stones. Considerations for Use\n\nCouch grass is used as a tea or used to irrigate the kidneys. When used as an irrigant, it is important to consume copious amounts of water. No irrigations should be done in those with edema due to heart or kidney failure. The bulk herb is available from online retailers and in herb shops. Herb gardeners attempting to grow couch grass should exercise caution, since it easily becomes an uncontrollable weed. DAMIANA\n\nLatin name: _Turnera diffusa_ (Turneraceae [damiana] family)\n\nGeneral Description\n\nDamiana is an aromatic shrub of the hot and humid reaches of Texas, Mexico, Central America, and Namibia. Growing to a height of six feet (two meters), it bears upward-growing stems with pale, smooth, green leaves and small, yellow flowers. The leaves are harvested for medicinal use in summer, when the plant is in flower.Animal studies indicate that the herb has blood sugar\u2013lowering effects and is an anti-inflammatory.It also seems to bind progesterone but not estrogen and may be helpful in menopause formulas and to increase sexual function.Damiana has been associated with improved sexual function for both men and women.",

It is important to recognize your symptoms as early as possible and seek professional help. When PTSD is the primary problem, then once your treatment is under way your mood, panic, and sleep will improve and you will feel less inclined to turn to substances to help you cope. If possible, avoid alcohol and other substances. Recognize your desire to cope with alcohol or substances as a sign that you need help with your PTSD. ### **How long does treatment last for? **\n\nTrauma-focused CBT is a short-term therapy that lasts for about three months depending on your needs. Typically between eight and twelve sessions are offered; these may last sixty to ninety minutes each session. If you have had more than one trauma, treatment is likely to last longer so that the therapist can help you come to terms with everything that has happened to you. ### **What should I do if I think I have PTSD? **\n\nIf you are in the UK, go to your GP and ask for a referral for trauma-focused psychological therapy.

This point is typically 2-3 in. proximal to the radio-carpal joint. This entity is seen in sports involving repetitive wrist extension. ##### 3.3.1.1 Ligamentous Injuries of the Wrist\n\n(a)\n\nScapholunate injuries: Are considered to be the most common ligamentous injury of the wrist. In its typical pattern, the injury is the result of abnormally large forces causing wrist extension, ulnar deviation and supination at the carpal bones. In extreme situations seen with complete scapholunate rupture, the normal alignment between scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum is lost: a characteristic appearance of scapholunate dissociation is seen on plain radiographs. This injury pattern is seen in collision with the fellow sports personnel and fall on an outstretched hand, with the hand held in the above position at the time of the impact in both instances. (b)\n\nLunotriquetral injuries: Are less common compared to scapholunate injuries and usually do not progress to arthrosis and collapse of the architecture of proximal row of carpal bones. These injuries occur as the result of forces that cause wrist extension, radial deviation and pronation at the carpal bones. Unlike scapholunate ruptures, insufficiency of lunotriquetral ligament does not disrupt the normal alignment of the lunate and triquetrum due to presence of extrinsic dorsal and volar ulnar ligaments stabilizing these carpal bones. (c)\n\nTriangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries: The TFFC transmitting about one fifth of the axial load from the wrist to the forearm plays a pivotal role as a stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint. TFFC is a ligamento-cartilagenous complex separating the proximal row of the carpus and ulna.The TFCC is completed on the ulnar side by the ulnar collateral ligament, and the extensor carpi ulnaris sheath.Principally, TFCC injuries are divided into traumatic (class I) and degenerative tears (class II), the former being more common in athletes.Each class is further subdivided into A, B, C, and D, with IB being the commonest type of injuries in the athletes.",

In the determination of arterial blood gases by the clinical laboratory, both pH and PaCO2 are measured, and the [HCO3\u2013] is calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This calculated value should be compared with the measured [HCO3\u2013] (total CO2) on the electrolyte panel. These two values should agree within 2 mmol/L. If they do not, the values may not have been drawn simultaneously, a laboratory error may be present, or an error could have been made in calculating the [HCO3\u2013]. After verifying the blood acid-base values, the precise acid-base disorder can then be identified. **CALCULATE THE ANION GAP** All evaluations of acid-base disorders should include a simple calculation of the AG; it represents those unmeasured anions in plasma (normally 10 to 12 mmol/L) and is calculated as follows: AG = Na+ \u2013(Cl\u2013 \\+ HCO3\u2013). The unmeasured anions include anionic proteins, (e.g., albumin), phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions. When acid anions, such as acetoacetate and lactate, accumulate in extracellular fluid, the AG increases, causing a high-AG acidosis. An increase in the AG is most often due to an increase in unmeasured anions and, less commonly, is due to a decrease in unmeasured cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium). In addition, the AG may increase with an increase in anionic albumin, because of either increased albumin concentration or alkalosis, which alters albumin charge.A fall in serum albumin by 1 g/dL from the normal value (4.5 g/dL) decreases the AG by 2.5 meq/L.Know the common causes of a high-AG acidosis (Table 38\u20133).",

Computed tomography (CT\u2014see page 2037) is done to check for bleeding. A spinal tap (lumbar puncture\u2014see page 635) is done if CT is inconclusive or unavailable. It can detect any blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. A spinal tap is not done if doctors suspect that pressure within the skull is increased. Cerebral angiography (see Angiography) is done as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the site of the aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation causing the bleeding. Magnetic resonance angiography (see page 2041) or CT angiography (see page 2038) may be used instead. Prognosis\n\nAbout 35% of people die when they have a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysm because it results in extensive brain damage. Another 15% die within a few weeks because of bleeding from a second rupture. People who survive for 6 months but who do not have surgery for the aneurysm have a 3% chance of another rupture each year. The outlook is better when the cause is an arteriovenous malformation. Occasionally, the hemorrhage is caused by a small defect that is not detected by cerebral angiography because the defect has already sealed itself off. In such cases, the outlook is very good. SPOTLIGHT ON AGING\n\n  After a stroke, older people are more likely to have problems, such as pressure sores, pneumonia, permanently shortened muscles (contractures) that limit movement, and depression. Older people are also more likely to already have disorders that limit treatment of stroke.Some treatments, such as endarterectomy, are more likely to cause complications in older people.Nonetheless, treatment decisions should be based on the person's health rather than on age itself.Some disorders common among older people can interfere with their recovery after a stroke, as in the following:\n\n  People with dementia may not understand what is required of them for rehabilitation.",

His book has been honored with the Mom's Choice Gold Award, the American Non-Fiction Authors' Association Silver award, and the 2012 International Book Award for Best Parent-Resource. MOVING PAST HISTORICAL STEREOTYPES OF AUTISM\n\nThe medical pathologist focuses the microscope to sharpen his view on the odd-looking cells. Using a special stain to color them, with a closer look, he positively identifies adenocarcinoma. There's no mystery or guess work. The cells meet the globally accepted characteristics of this well-defined type of cancer. Within a few hours, the family is called into the doctor's office for the devastating news. At the same time, he is able to give them clear treatment options, answer their questions, and explain the statistical probability of beating it. In a different part of the hospital, a less certain diagnosis is being made with an even less certain course of treatment. Unlike the pathologist staring straight at the cancer cells, autism is not a cell we can see. We can't measure it like insulin in blood for diabetes or as a biomarker in urine. Autism doesn't have a certain temperature like a fever or a specific blood pressure. Instead, autism is made up of a group of behavioral symptoms that the doctor observes and then decides, subjectively, if they look \"autistic enough.\" It's not uncommon for parents to get two different opinions about the severity of their child's autism or even if it's autism at all. One boy is already falling well behind his peers. He can speak but doesn't have conversations, and he doesn't play with toys typically the way his peers do.The psychiatrist is looking for a specific yet broad set of behaviors (or absence of typically present behavior) that may add up to the necessary group of symptoms for a diagnosis.It's a complex process.Typically, a diagnosing physician or psychologist has a fairly limited time to observe a young three-year-old's range of behaviors.In some cases, an hour or less.",

The LX act as agonist ligands for specific GPCR resulting in the activation of cellular responses important to inflammation and inflammatory resolution. The LX and their analogs exert important activities related to airway inflammation, asthma, arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disease, periodontal disease, kidney diseases and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and many other diseases/disorders where uncontrolled inflammation is a key mediator of disease pathogenesis (Figure 24-1). The synthesis of the lipoxins occurs via 3 distinct pathways, one of which is triggered via the actions of aspirin. The 2 \"classical\" pathways for the synthesis of the lipoxins are the result of the concerted actions of 15-LOX acting on arachidonic acid in epithelial cells (eg, airway epithelia) and 5-LOX in leukocytes or through the actions of 5-LOX in leukocytes followed by 12-LOX action in platelets (Figure 24-2). This latter activity requires that platelets interact directly with adherent neutrophils as occurs only following platelet activation. Activated leukocytes that adhere to epithelial cells as a consequence inflammation (such as gastrointestinal, airway, or kidney epithelia) induce the production of lipoxins. An additional stimulus that leads to production of lipoxins is epithelial cell conversion of LTA4 that is released from airway epithelia. **FIGURE 24-2: Pathways for the synthesis of LXA 4 and LXB4. ** Reproduced with permission of themedicalbiochemistrypage, LLC. ### **Activities of the Lipoxins**\n\nThe lipoxins are potent anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and counteract the actions of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (primarily LTB4 but also PGE2 and TXA2)._ALXR_ is a multirecognition receptor involved in immune responses, which was originally identified as the formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) protein; a member of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family of receptors that bind _N_ -formulated peptides derived by the degradation of bacteria or host cells.The FPR family of receptors is involved in mediating immune responses to infection.",

Although there never was any evidence that Vioxx offered more effective pain relief, people were hopeful. Doctors were convinced that the digestive tract protection such drugs were supposed to provide would be well worthwhile. It wasn't until years later that studies revealed these drugs increased the risk of dying from heart attacks and strokes.,\n\nWhat can someone do for joint pain that undermines the quality of life? Despite the problems with NSAID pills, it is possible to use NSAIDs topically. They may kick in a bit more slowly with pain relief, but after two or three weeks, the relief they offer is pretty similar. The Food and Drug Administration has approved three forms of diclofenac to be applied to the skin on or near the sore joint: Voltaren Gel, Flector patch, and Pennsaid Topical Solution. Putting medicine on the skin might trigger a rash in sensitive individuals, but it is less likely to cause serious digestive tract problems. Adverse reactions are still possible, so patients using one of these topical pain medicines need to stay in touch with their physicians. Another approach that the doctor may offer a desperate patient is a steroid injection into the joint. Although this treatment often eases pain in the short term, it does not provide reliable long-term relief for tendinitis. Steroid injections may offer many patients relief from arthritis joint pain for a few months, but the pain relief appears to fade more quickly with each subsequent injection. If a steroid injection seems to be the best option to calm a painful joint, request that it be done under ultrasound guidance. This helps ensure that the medication gets where it belongs. Keep in mind, though, that corticosteroids can weaken tendons.Arthritis expert Joanne Jordan, MD, MPH, Herman and Louise Smith Distinguished Professor of Medicine and director of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina, reminds us that both doctors and patient make a big mistake if they overlook all the nondrug approaches that can be helpful.",

Apparently, this raises the idea that in the background of massive obesity and diabetes not only gluttony but also some primary disorder of such incretin mechanisms [42] might play a role. ### Anorexia\u2014Eating Disorders\u2014Calorie Restriction\u2014Chronic Diseases\n\n#### Signaling Feeding State in Eating Disorders, Anorexia Nervosa\n\nIn anorexia nervosa the baseline PYY3-36, PP, CCK, and insulin plasma levels were high (although with great heterogeneity) [99,136\u2013139], and the postprandial CCK rise started earlier and reached higher peak values than in controls [140]. These seem to suggest that abnormalities of the GI peptides may be responsible for the anorexia. However, since most of these alterations were normalized after special feeding and recovery [141], the changes may also be regarded as consequences rather than causes of the disease. Data gained in cases of simple starvation and refeeding were different from those seen in anorexia nervosa and recovery from the disease.Bulimia nervosa is accompanied by elevated CCK level in the \"urge to vomit\" stage [145], but not earlier.",

Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in the presence of PIC [30]. PIC suppressed both the proliferation and invasion of cultured AH109A hepatoma cells [31]. PIC, at lower concentrations (25\u201350 \u03bcM), induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, while it caused apoptosis at a higher concentration (100 \u03bcM). PIC suppressed invasive capacity of hepatoma cells by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). PIC also suppressed the tumor growth and metastasis in hepatoma-bearing rats [31]. ### 9.2.6 Multidrug Resistance (MDR) Modulation\n\nThe identification of compounds that overcome the resistance to cancer cell apoptosis that frequently accompanies MDR is of great therapeutic importance. PIC effectively inhibited the multidrug resistance-associated protein, MRP1 as assessed by its ability to suppress the efflux of the fluorescent MRP1 substrate (BCECF) from human erythrocytes [32]. ### 9.2.7 Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of clonal B lymphocytes. Proliferation occurs in lymphoid tissues upon interaction of leukemic cells with a supportive microenvironment [33]. Therefore, the mobilization of tissue-resident CLL cells into the circulation is a useful therapeutic strategy to minimize the reservoir of tumor cells within survival niches. The exit of normal lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues depends on the presence of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and the expression of S1P receptor-1 (S1PR1). Activated CLL cells displayed reduced expression of S1PR1 and the migratory response toward S1P.

So stick with the program even if your blood pressure doesn't come down. After all, what you really care about is your sense of wellbeing and your living a long, healthy life. > \n> You _can_ reload the dice; you can change the odds of your suffering or dying from high blood pressure. > \n> You are the one who is ultimately responsible for your own health. To keep on top of this program, you should monitor your own progress, using the chart in Part Four. CHAPTER 9\n\nStep One: See Your Doctor\n\nThe very first step you should take is to see your doctor. Please do not get involved with the other steps of this program before you do this. The results could be disastrous. Your doctor needs to examine you to verify that you do indeed have high blood pressure, and if you do, to determine just what type of high blood pressure it is. Then, if certain types of hypertension are ruled out, your doctor should do the following:\n\n  * Advise you about any changes in whatever drugs you may currently be taking. * Evaluate your risk of coronary artery disease to determine the type and amount of exercise that is safe or you. * Monitor your progress with our program as a whole. GET A COMPLETE PHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGet a complete physical examination. Your doctor should carefully evaluate your blood pressure and test for other specific disease conditions that may cause high blood pressure. In order to get a complete picture, your doctor will have to do specific tests and will have to see you regularly. DO YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE? On three separate visits, your doctor should measure your blood pressure while you are relaxed and not talking, at least twice on each visit and at least once on both arms.Because of this, a 1986 editorial in the journal _Hypertension_ recommended that if the initial diastolic pressure is above 90 mm Hg, the blood pressure should be remeasured on at least two more occasions during the next four weeks.If during this time the diastolic blood pressure falls below 90 mm Hg, the recommendation is that further measurements be made at three-month intervals for a year.",

Endocrine or islet cell tumours may be treated with hormone therapy, in which specific hormones are used to stop or slow the growth of the cancer in the endocrine cells. Targeted drug therapies that block cellular processes driving cancer cell proliferation have been used in combination with chemotherapy in some pancreatic cancer patients. For example, a drug called erlotinib (Tarceva) blocks the activity of a kinase (a type of enzyme) associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which stimulates unregulated cell division when mutated in cancer cells. When erlotinib is given in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (Gemzar), an antimetabolite that inhibits the synthesis of genetic material in dividing cells, patient survival is improved, although only modestly. Several other targeted drugs such as cetuximab (Erbitux), a monoclonal antibody that binds to EGFR and thus prevents kinase activation and cell division, are being developed and tested in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer. In most cases, pancreatic cancer cannot be completely prevented, but risk can be decreased by reducing or eliminating cigarette smoking and following a diet low in animal products and high in fruits and vegetables. Researchers are also investigating anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents that inhibit an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Because COX-2 plays a role in inflammation and mediates tumour growth and development, it is a valuable target for the development of drugs used in the prevention and treatment of several cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In people at risk for familial pancreatic cancer, routine endoscopy can be used to monitor changes in pancreatic tissue.##\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe digestive system is relatively simple in anatomic terms\u2014it is a tube through which food passes and is broken down into useful components.The physical and chemical processes that underlie the passage of food and the extraction and absorption of nutrients are relatively recent discoveries, having been made primarily in the 20th century.",

It does so by opening additional calcium channels in heart cell membranes. This speeds up the rate at which the sinus node cells fire, so that the heart rate is increased, and it also boosts the amount of calcium that is released from the intracellular stores and thereby enhances the strength of contraction. Adrenaline is made by the adrenal glands that lie just above the kidney, and is secreted into the bloodstream in response to stress or exercise; a related substance with a similar action, noradrenaline, is released from nerves that innervate the heart. Although an increased heart rate during exercise is essential in order to ensure that the limb muscles are adequately supplied with fuel and oxygen, too fast a rate is deleterious. This is because the heart muscles themselves cannot be supplied with oxygen fast enough. The consequence is angina \u2013 a severe incapacitating chest pain that can extend down the left arm. Angina is more easily precipitated in people whose coronary blood vessels are narrowed as a result of atherosclerotic plaques (fatty deposits in the vessel walls). Consequently, an exercise test, which increases the heart rate and thus its oxygen demand, is often used to test the health of the coronary vessels. Angina is not only brought on by exertion: it can also be triggered by anger, excitement or emotional stress. I vividly remember the time I was sailing a small yacht up the Ijmuiden canal to Amsterdam and debris became entangled around our propeller, rendering the engine useless. This canal is a major shipping route and it was extremely busy. Huge, heavily loaded commercial barges, with very limited ability to manoeuvre, were bearing down on us.He retired below deck to crush a glass capsule of amyl nitrate (nitroglycerin) under his nose and inhale the vapour.This eased his pain by dilating the coronary vessels and increasing blood flow to his heart.Nitroglycerin acts by releasing a natural gas called nitric oxide, which stimulates the production of a chemical called cyclic GMP that causes blood vessels to relax.",

There are several studies that suggest antiresorptive treatment may lead to areas of bone necrosis and/or altered biomechanical integrity long before clinical ONJ presents [8\u201310]. Notably, empty osteocyte lacunae are found in cortical bone after long\u2010term treatment with zoledronate in the absence of clinical ONJ. This is one of the underlying premises supporting the categorization of stage 0 ONJ [4], yet similar findings have not been convincingly verified in humans. Suppression of bone turnover, through inhibition of osteoclastic activity, is at the core of the underlying necrosis and altered biomechanical integrity; however, suppression of bone turnover alone is not sufficient to cause ONJ. It is likely that inhibition of osteoclastic function compromises the ability of the alveolar bone to respond to extrinsic local factors and maintain a normal homeostasis [11]. Trauma features prominently in the pathogenesis of ONJ with 46% to 79% of ONJ patients having dentoalveolar trauma preceding ONJ clinical presentation, and specifically dental extraction [12]. Spontaneous incidence of ONJ may also be attributed to the trauma associated with normal masticatory function or dental prosthetic devices coupled with a very thin oral mucosa overlying the bone. Once the osseous tissue is exposed, infection is likely a key factor [13]. More than 750 species of bacteria are found in the oral cavity and comprise complex communities existing primarily in biofilms on the surfaces of teeth, prostheses, gingiva, and tongue [14]. The immune system reaction to oral microflora that are deleterious to wound healing coupled with compromised osseous integrity and the lack of osteoclastic remodeling may be particularly devastating for the development of clinical ONJ.Recent evidence suggests that bisphosphonate therapy results in significant differences in the expression of genes regulating immune function, barrier functions, tissue remodeling, and lymphangiogenesis [16, 17].",

In the context of determining the effectiveness of lorlatinib for people with ALK-positive NSCLC, the ECOG performance status can provide important information about a patient's prognosis and potential response to treatment.\n\nThe significance of the ECOG performance status lies in its association with disease progression and overall survival.

For example, individuals with an ECOG score of 2 may have more advanced disease or comorbidities that could impact their response to treatment.\n\nIn the case of lorlatinib, clinical evidence from the CROWN trial has shown favorable results for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. However, it is worth noting that this trial primarily included patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, meaning they had good functional ability. This raises questions about how lorlatinib may perform in individuals with an ECOG score of 2, as there is limited data available specifically for this subgroup.\n\nGiven that the ECOG performance status is considered a prognostic variable, it is possible that lorlatinib may have different levels of effectiveness in patients with an ECOG score of 2 compared to those with lower scores. However, further research and evidence are needed to fully understand the impact of ECOG performance status on treatment outcomes with lorlatinib.\n\nIt is important for healthcare professionals to consider the individual patient's characteristics, including their ECOG performance status, when making treatment decisions.

It has been noted that lorlatinib, a medication being studied in one of these trials, may be less effective in people with an ECOG of 2. However, it is important to consider that this could also be the case for the comparator arm in the trial.\n\nMost individuals with an ECOG of 2 would likely respond quickly to treatment, resulting in an improvement in their ECOG performance status. Therefore, they may not meet the specific criteria for enrollment into a clinical trial as their condition improves before the trial begins.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the proportion of people with an ECOG of 0 or 1 in clinical trials of other medications like alectinib and brigatinib was similar to that observed in the lorlatinib trial. Additionally, lorlatinib's marketing authorization is not restricted by ECOG performance status.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many sites conducting the CROWN study are located in Asia, resulting in a higher proportion of participants from Asian family backgrounds compared to what would typically be seen in clinical practice in the UK. The possibility of family background being an effect modifier was explored through analysis of lorlatinib pharmacokinetics, which found no inherent differences between individuals with Asian and non-Asian family backgrounds.\n\nIn summary, clinical trials often recruit individuals with an ECOG performance status of only 0 or 1 due to selective recruitment processes.

The CROWN trial compared lorlatinib with crizotinib, which was the most relevant comparator at the time of the trial design.

It's important to note that there was no crossover to lorlatinib in the CROWN trial.\n\nAt the September 2021 data cut, a significant proportion of patients in both the crizotinib arm and lorlatinib arm of the CROWN trial had received a subsequent second-generation ALK TKI. However, fewer patients in the lorlatinib arm went on to receive a subsequent treatment compared to those in the crizotinib arm.\n\nIn current NHS practice, first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC typically involves alectinib or brigatinib. Second-line treatment often includes lorlatinib, while chemotherapy is commonly used as a third-line option.\n\nIt's worth noting that brigatinib is also recommended as a second-line treatment option after crizotinib.

The evidence suggested that lorlatinib reduced the risk of death compared with crizotinib, but this difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier curves initially showed a potential advantage for lorlatinib in terms of overall survival, but later reconverged. \n\nOne limitation was that the data on progression-free and overall survival from the CROWN trial was considered immature due to a limited number of events. This means that there were not enough instances of progression or death within the study population to draw robust conclusions about overall survival. It was noted that longer progression-free survival could potentially lead to increased overall survival with lorlatinib, but again, no definitive conclusions could be made.\n\nFurthermore, it should be mentioned that data on overall survival was not available from September 2021 onwards because there were no recorded death events during that time period. Additional data cuts from the CROWN trial are planned for 2025 and 2028.\n\nIt is important to note that the trial is still ongoing and at the time of analysis, the median follow-up times for progression-free and overall survival outcomes were relatively short. This immaturity of data introduces a high level of uncertainty in interpreting the evidence.\n\nIn summary, while some indications pointed towards an advantage for lorlatinib in terms of overall survival, there were limitations and uncertainties associated with the data from the CROWN trial.

Firstly, the EAG requested that the company conduct an NMA that includes ALESIA to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Although the company initially believed that ALESIA was not suitable for their base-case analysis, they performed an NMA including ALESIA as a scenario analysis to offer a global perspective on lorlatinib's effectiveness compared to alectinib.\n\nThe EAG considered this NMA with ALESIA to be the most appropriate because it allowed for a more complete dataset when comparing alectinib and lorlatinib. Additionally, including ALESIA in the NMA resulted in a slight reduction in lorlatinib's treatment effect on progression-free survival relative to alectinib.\n\nFurthermore, the committee took into account that the CROWN trial included sites in Asia and had a higher proportion of individuals from an Asian family background than would typically be seen in the NHS. Considering all available evidence, the committee agreed with the EAG's recommendation as it increased the sample size for analysis and preferred using results from the global NMA, which incorporated data from the ALESIA trial.\n\nIn response to feedback during consultation, the company revised its base case by including results from the global NMA, including ALESIA. The committee concluded that this revised approach was appropriate for decision-making purposes.\n\nOverall, including ALESIA in the NMA for progression-free survival was supported by both the EAG and committee due to its ability to provide a more comprehensive analysis and increase sample size, ultimately leading to informed decision-making.",

                "text": "Identifying and monitoring central nervous system (CNS) metastases in patients with untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC can present several challenges. The availability of brain imaging or MRI at the time of diagnosis varies across NHS hospitals, which means that not all patients have access to these diagnostic tools. As a result, the proportion of patients with or without CNS metastases at diagnosis remains unknown.\n\nAdditionally, some patients may not experience symptoms related to CNS metastases and therefore may not seek a brain scan. This further complicates the identification process as individuals with minor lesions that do not immediately impact prognosis or quality of life may go undetected.\n\nThe impact of these challenges on the quality of life for patients with untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC is significant. CNS metastases can have a substantial effect on both physical and psychological well-being. Symptoms such as headaches, seizures, cognitive impairment, and neurological deficits can significantly impair daily functioning and reduce overall quality of life.\n\nFurthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the presence or absence of CNS metastases can cause emotional distress for patients. Not knowing whether they have metastatic disease in their central nervous system adds an additional layer of anxiety and uncertainty to their already difficult situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges in identifying and monitoring CNS metastases in patients with untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC can have a significant impact on their quality of life. Limited access to brain imaging or MRI at diagnosis and the potential lack of symptoms related to CNS metastases contribute to difficulties in detecting these lesions early. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure timely intervention and support for patients experiencing CNS metastases.",

Simply comparing the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events between medications can be misleading. It is crucial to take into account the specific nature of these events and how they may impact a person's overall well-being.\n\nFor instance, while a rise in cholesterol levels may not have an immediate effect on quality of life, a grade 3 or 4 neurological adverse event could significantly impact someone's daily functioning and overall quality of life. Therefore, understanding the severity and potential consequences of adverse events is vital in evaluating the comparative safety profiles of different medications.\n\nIn the case of lorlatinib, clinical experts have suggested that it has a different side effect profile compared to other ALK TKIs such as alectinib and brigatinib. This distinction is particularly important for individuals with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The decision regarding treatment options involves weighing the potential benefits in terms of progression-free survival with lorlatinib against its unique safety profile.\n\nPatient experts also emphasize the importance of considering different side effect profiles when choosing between these medications. Some individuals reported experiencing better quality of life on lorlatinib compared to alectinib or brigatinib, while others found the reverse to be true. Notably, some side effects associated with alectinib were not observed with lorlatinib, suggesting that certain individuals may experience less fatigue when taking lorlatinib.\n\nOverall, considering both the nature and impact of adverse events on quality of life is crucial when comparing lorlatinib to other ALK TKIs.

This is particularly beneficial in the context of limited evidence base for overall survival data. The state-transition approach involves determining state occupancy based on transition probabilities applied to each health state, rather than relying solely on trial-derived survival curves. By explicitly modeling state-transition probabilities, this approach can overcome inconsistencies in available survival evidence, especially when the evidence is still immature. Additionally, the flexibility offered by the state-transition approach enables the incorporation of a wider range of treatments that people have after progression, making the model more aligned with real-world scenarios and NHS practice. Overall, using a state-transition approach improves the accuracy and reliability of modeling health states and transition probabilities when there is limited evidence available for overall survival data.\n\nReference: Study 1001 for survival with lorlatinib used second line after progression on first-line alectinib or brigatinib",

Therefore, both patients and clinicians may be hesitant to suspend treatment with lorlatinib if it continues to provide some clinical benefit.

                "text": "The decision to consider treatment with lorlatinib beyond disease progression for a longer duration than initially estimated by the company was influenced by several factors. Clinical advice suggested that approximately 50% of people would continue on lorlatinib beyond disease progression at second line, and the treatment would typically continue for an average of 3 months. This expectation also applies to lorlatinib in a first-line position because there are currently no other ALK TKIs available after lorlatinib, and chemotherapy would be used as a second-line treatment.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no stopping rule for lorlatinib in its marketing authorization, and the decision to continue treatment beyond progression is made by clinicians in consultation with individuals with ALK-positive NSCLC. The company's model assumed that treatment duration would be the same as the period of progression-free survival and did not allow for treatment beyond progression.\n\nHowever, an exploratory scenario presented by the Evidence Appraisal Group (EAG) considered data from a retrospective analysis of Study 1001, which showed that 75.6% of people continued to receive lorlatinib after progressing on other ALK TKIs. In this study, the median additional duration of treatment beyond progression was 5.7 months. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund also expressed their belief that treatment with lorlatinib could extend beyond 3 months after disease progression.\n\nBased on these considerations, it was concluded that treatment with lorlatinib beyond disease progression could potentially last longer than the initial estimate provided by the company. Ultimately, the decision regarding the duration of treatment with lorlatinib beyond disease progression is made on an individual basis by healthcare professionals in collaboration with patients.",

Specifically, there was a considerable difference between the utility values assigned to the progression of disease (PD) health state compared to the progression-free health state. The EAG suggested that these high utility values may not accurately represent the quality of life experienced by patients with progressed disease.

Immature progression-free survival and overall survival data: If the data used to estimate these parameters are limited or based on early results, it can introduce uncertainty into the cost-effectiveness estimates. More mature data is needed for more reliable predictions.\n\n3. Differences in baseline characteristics between trials: Variations in patient populations, such as differences in the proportion of people with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline, can impact treatment outcomes and cost-effectiveness estimates. These differences need to be carefully considered when modeling.\n\n4. Uncertainty regarding CNS metastases' impact on treatment effect: It is important to understand how CNS metastases at baseline affect treatment response and whether it influences cost-effectiveness outcomes. Lack of clarity on this aspect adds uncertainty to the estimates.\n\nIt is crucial for economic models to address these factors and incorporate relevant data and assumptions to reduce uncertainties in cost-effectiveness estimates.

This addresses the need for treatment options that can effectively penetrate the brain, especially in cases where current treatments are not as effective.
