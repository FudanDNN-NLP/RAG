(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.

We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.",

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\n highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of theprocess\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\n difficult  for carriers  to find and book the shipments  that work for their businesses,  spending hours on the phone negotiating  pricing  and terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4",
        "912b00f7-d4df-45bc-a51e-df9800709088": "which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipm\nent with the touch of a button.We\n serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure\n capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvement\ns over traditional freight brokerage providers.During\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\n Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in transportation  management.

Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa\nce in each of our offerings includes:\u2022\nMobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\nre.\u2022\nDelivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and\n merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also c\nompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.  Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate\n in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and\n regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,\n labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly\n evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des\ncribed below.Mobility\nOur\n platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions\n in  which  we  operate.  A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo\nreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In\n the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including\n licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and\n regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including\n Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations\n banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi\nties for our business and operating model.Substantially\n all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.

These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp\nections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In\n addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.",

For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill\n 5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney\n General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction  and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged  misclassification  of drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj\noining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the\n parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot\n initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able\n to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith\n the provisions of Proposition 22.

We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same condi\ntions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements,\n including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing\n requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.\n Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on\n our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\n\u2022\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be pi\ncked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon\n the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime\n and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on\n our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour\n platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement\n minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislativeor regulatory initia\ntives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See\n the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our busin\ness and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we \nmay be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and Protection\nOur\n technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance\n with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators\n around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the Europea\nn Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a lawwhich went into effect in\n May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer\n Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor\n covered  businesses.

For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments\n B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the\u201cEEA\u201d).\n Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses\n to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdi\nctions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.Antitrust\nCompetition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are do\ning so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7",

In  addition,governmental\n agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significantfines\n or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual rel\nationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.

We have typically \nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19\n pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande\nmic continues.Delivery\nWe\n typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical\n growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc\nelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe\n are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately\n 72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.

The  issues  of  stress  and  balance  were  particularly  exacerbated  among  caregivers  of  youngchildren.\n To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigatedthis crisis in their pe\nrsonal and professional lives.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need thro\nugh employee engagement surveysand\n related  tools. We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.  But in2021,\n we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to\n better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth\n opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased\n on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri\ncs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee\n Development  and  Retention.

Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem\n to have an impact on other areas of the business.

To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses\n throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people\n with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically \nunderrepresented groups.Our\n Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior ex\necutives.We\n encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.\nAs\n a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.",

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created9",
        "c3b6c9d9-f49a-471d-94dd-e2901bda62d9": "through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\n\u2022\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp\n based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward.

These challenges cou\nld result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The\n COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand\n may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof\n our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot\n believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.\n The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th\ne outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,\n adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,\n foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019\n behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.

Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our busin\ness, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Driv\ners were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\nform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13",
        "7c49826d-6ad6-4a94-8278-17c5b9c79e79": "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).",

Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward.\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting\n Estimates\u201d  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  \u201cNotes  to  the Consolidated  FinancialStatements\u201d included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14",

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i\nmpacted.Our\n platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\n fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\n entry that characterize these industries.

We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well asour\n reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and maturein\n these  areas.

Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating\n that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing\n operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite\n permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or\n Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.\n In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,\n the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave\n entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,\n we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor\nts in all jurisdictions.If\n we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those\n offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad\nversely impacted.We\n have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.\n For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the\n combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh\naring24",

We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies\n that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor\n us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.\nFederal\n and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations\n could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we\n may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.\nOur\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover.",

The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.

If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\n control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\n alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\n our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\nating results.If\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da\nta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We\n collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers\n and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

For example, in May 2014, we experienced a datasecurity\n incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that anemployee had unintentiona\nlly posted publicly on a26",

As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in\n April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto\n certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity\n breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant \nliabilities.If\n we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat\ning results would be adversely affected.To\n continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new\n products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in\n January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider\n destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc\ne of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing\n and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends\n on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew\n or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.

If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif\n platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our op\nerating results.We\n track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation\n provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.",

Whilethese\n numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring\n how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough\n we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe\n measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies.

If we do not succes\nsfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and\n Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers\n to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun\nted for approximately 7% of our global27",
        "93895597-0bfd-48b2-af0a-2b1995739f97": "Gross  Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard\n (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating\n rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.

Any actual or perceived failure tomaintain\n the performance,  reliability,  security,  and availability  of  our products,  offerings,  and technical  infrastructure  to the satisfaction  of  platform  users andcertain\n regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business,and our decreased abili\nty to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors \ncould adversely affect our business.Our\n platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependentupon our\n ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in thefuture\n contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in oursoftware,\n third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactionsbetween\n systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact theavailability of\n our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould\n result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such\n as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers\n may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease\n of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,\n bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience\n for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,\n loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness\n and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI\n algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial datapractices by us or others cou\nld impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations.

While we employ practices designedto monitor our\n compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource\n license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms\n of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source\n software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation\n of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain po\nrtions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In\n addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source\n licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.

Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.

New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations\n in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale\n of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, oper\nating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes may be limited.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4\n billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,\n 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we\n also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards\n depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome\n tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC, if  a  corporationundergoes\n an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019sability\n to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change\n income may be limited.  Many U.S. states follow similar  rules for restricting  use of tax attributes  after  an ownership change. We may experienceownership\n changes  in  the  future  because  of  subsequent  shifts  in  our  stock  ownership.  As  a  result,  if  we  earn  net  taxable  income,  our  ability  to  use  our  pre-ownership\n change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, whichcould potentially resul\nt in increased future tax liability to us.33",

In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,\n which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays.

Any of these factors may \nadversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or l\nimited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.\n In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s\n Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject.",

For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\nates. If other35",

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\n operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges\n and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial\n performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat\n we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\n business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.

For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we\n may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\n or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are activelychallenging\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\n emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\n electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide.

Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers.

The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating resu\nlts.In\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.

Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct.

Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by those users. A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties.",

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538",

Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel\nl as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.We\n are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.\nThese\n government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.\n If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange\n our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational\n harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations. Any of these deve\nlopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We\n face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act\nion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The\n nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These\n and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws. Suchviolations\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\n consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\n failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\n million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\n of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments\n with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand\n assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement\n actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced\n by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities\n that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,\n 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat\n Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed \nand may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This\n risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,\n we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.",

The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR\n further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories\n of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual\n decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\n our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\n including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst\n businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states\n have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides\n another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These\n laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)\n39",

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and \njudicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy\n of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If\n we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal\n data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be\n required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor\n obtaining or maintaining  a license  or otherwise, from law enforcement  agencies,  and from intelligence  agencies.  This disclosure  may result in a failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, n\notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe\n same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain\n government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and\n ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto\n suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary\n or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co\nmply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off\nerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such\n data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance\n requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,\n and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure\n by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,\n consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound\n liable, significant damages.

However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\non company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\n adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions.

During the \nevaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we \nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We\n cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings\n (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal\n control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude\n that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness\n in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice\n of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor\n other regulatory authorities.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod\n 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\n taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in\ntend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings\nWhile\n it is not possible to determine  the outcome  of the legal  actions,  investigations,  and proceedings  brought against  us, we believe  that,  except for thematters\n described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial\n to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.

We connect consumers with providersof\n ride services and merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers withpublic transportation networks. We use this same network, tech\nnology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freightindustry.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged\n market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial\n position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019declarations\n of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave,\n and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore,\n we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns reg\narding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response Initiatives\nWe continue to priorit\nize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe\n will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving\n our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the gro\nwth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, s\nervices or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To\n comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost\n markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.\nAs\n vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer\n demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve dri\nver availability in the near-term.While\n we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash\n flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves\n or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions\n that  may be taken  by governmental  authorities,  the further  impact  on the business of Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and business partners,  and otherfactors identified \nin Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification Developments\nThe\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020,\n the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior\n Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused\n by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Foll\nowing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe\n preliminary injunction.",

Foll\nowing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe\n preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for \nindependent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary\n injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\nIn\n January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which\n was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition\n 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Servic\nes has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we\n have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor\n for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financia\nl position, or cash flows.Also\n of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be \nclassified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent49",
        "241a2ffc-38cc-408a-b555-16c45ce86cc8": "contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling. Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers. Damages may includ\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\n Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\nntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.\n Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.",

Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce.

We have based our estimates on historical experience andon\n various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying\n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty invol\nved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64",

Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives.

The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.\nManagement's\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.

This valuation requiresjudgment\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\n statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\n cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\n the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.

A credit-related\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\n (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nWe\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 netincome or\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter inarrears.\n Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.\nWe\n review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment\n may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv\nestees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul\nd have to be determinedand an\n impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately \nheld companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and66",

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We\n review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations,\n settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.

We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  Theestablishment\n of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets.

The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,\n as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition.

The service-based vesting condition for themajority\n of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th\ne market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We\n account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,\n which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.

These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\nWe\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f\ninancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69",

Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.

Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers\n (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)\n with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother\n delivery services.

Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.",

COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.  In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.

We  record  an  allowance  fordoubtful\n accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for\n fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as costof\n revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographicaltrends,\n which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life arecharged to operating expens\nes as incurred.We capitalize c\nertain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use\n software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completedand\n the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and beginsonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together \nwith costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed asincurred. In addition, we cap\nitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle\n assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for saleas of\n December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd.

We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.

Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\nOperating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized\n as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operat\ning lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.Acquisitions\nWe\n account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

Our marketable equity securities inpublicly\n traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin\n non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions\n for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable\n equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable\n equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue\n on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment\n exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment. We include \ninvestments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities\nAccounting\n for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.\n Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value. Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude\n commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities\n with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale\n debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn\nings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As\n of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone\n year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de\nbt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-\nfor-sale Debt SecuritiesWe\n account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).  Weadopted\n ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.

Incircumstances\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\n actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\n of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\n income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements inexpected cash flows due to imp\nrovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nInvestments\n in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial\n interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.

This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\n measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\n accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.  Refer  to Note 3 \u2013Investments and Fair Value Me\nasurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities\nWe\n evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity\n for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial\n statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly\n affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially\n be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether\n we are still the primary beneficiary.

We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers\u2019  and  Merchants\u2019  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand\n lead generation,  and related  services,  including facilitating  payments from end-users. The service  enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive  andfulfill\n on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate\n revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight serv\nices.We periodically re\nassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87",
        "b02901df-45da-465f-ab7a-1b0bbd6fd655": "Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe\n primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\n and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The\n acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.\n We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\n markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\nivery transactions.In all\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\nr customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\n the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery\n service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.\n As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.",

We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\ne services provided to end-users.In\n the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\n to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\n services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\nces.Mobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\norm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.\n Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \na trip.88",
        "b3ba5c2e-5cf8-4715-8e21-4899eb8a6b0a": "In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect ourservice fee\n from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As wecurrently\n have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded\n collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected\n from Drivers.Mobility revenue also inc\nludes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.Delivery\nWe\n derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete\n a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods. We r\necognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In\n the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween\n the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay\n Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. Wetypically receive the service fee \nwithin a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.Freight\nWe\n derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) during thefourth\n quarter  of  2021,  our  Freight  revenue  also  includes  revenue  from  transportation  management.  Refer  to  Note  18  \u2013  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl\nace acquisition.Brokerage\nBrokerage\n revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred\n with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.\n We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the shipment  request  establishesenforceable\n rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate\n contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment\n by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper\u2019s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent\n freight carriers.

While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment \nfor our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management\nWe\n provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service\ns. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese\n services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology.

Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services.

This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\nship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\n significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020\nDuring\n 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest.

We regularly review the deferredtax\n assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences\n and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,\n our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.

In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable\n to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and\n tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi\ntional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The\n indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can\n affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere\n resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn\n January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d\n test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming\n services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s\n control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo\nr the hiring entity.On\n May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan\n Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive\n advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.

The complaint alleges Driversare\n employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss thecomplaint\n on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling\n was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V.\n are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 asdependent\n workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno\n impact on our current operations.

On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle\n entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon\n behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether\n Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In\n March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy.

During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial CornershopInvestment\u201d).

The Initial CornershopInvestment\n was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,\n the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal\n $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe\n outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination.",

CONTROLS AND\n PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe\n maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile\n or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods\n specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our\n Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)\n under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure\n controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\n will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\n Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal\n Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on thatassessment,\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021.
