The presence of CNS metastases at baseline may be associated with a poorer prognosis compared to patients without CNS metastases. Additionally, the effectiveness of certain treatments, such as ALK TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), may be reduced in patients with baseline CNS metastases.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be some bias in the treatment effect associated with ALK TKIs due to the lower proportion of patients with CNS metastases in certain studies. However, due to small sample sizes, it was not possible to conduct stratified subgroup analysis to definitively determine if baseline CNS metastases are a treatment-effect modifier for lorlatinib compared to other ALK TKIs.\n\nPublished literature suggests that baseline CNS metastases do not significantly affect progression-free survival when comparing lorlatinib and alectinib. However, it has been observed that lorlatinib is more effective than brigatinib in patients without CNS metastases, but this improvement is not seen in patients with CNS metastases.\n\nOverall, baseline CNS metastases can potentially impact prognosis and treatment effectiveness in patients with advanced NSCLC. Further research is needed to better understand the specific effects and optimal management strategies for this patient population.\n\nReference: This information is based on findings from an evaluation conducted by the EAG (Evidence Appraisal Group) and information provided by the company conducting research on lorlatinib.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), score=0.5449680935514006)]]}
