Their UK number one debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", and their debut studio album, Up All Night, followed later that year. The album contained three songs co-written by Styles, and made One Direction the first British group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States. Following his elimination early on, he was brought back to join the boy band One Direction, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Styles released his self-titled debut solo album through Columbia Records in 2017. Following a suggestion from his mother, on 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo contestant for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor, singing a rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\".\n\n"

In 1917 Milholland told stories of her imprisonment at the Ritz-Carlton alongside Dora Lewis and others. At a 1921 conference in Washington, D.C. she was honored for her part in the suffrage movement. McCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. In 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker Lucy Burns organized the Woman Suffrage Procession, a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration as president. Paul troubled NAWSA leaders by arguing that because Democrats would not act to enfranchise women even though they \n\n A serious challenge to the NAWSA leadership began to develop after a young activist named Alice Paul returned to the U.S. from England in 1910, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement.

West Ham reportedly had to beat off competition from some major European clubs to sign the two young players. He played three games before returning to West Ham. This was part of a deal which saw Christian Dailly move to West Ham for £1.7 million. Holding on to Hartson and Ferdinand gave Harry Redknapp's men an even more enhanced chance of achieving that goal next time round. West Ham, who had not named a substitute goalkeeper in their squad for the match, were forced to play the remainder of the second-half with midfielder Henri Lansbury in goal. He played 42 of West Ham's 46 match 2011–12 Championship season playing in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium which West Ham United won, sealing their immediate return into the Premier League. In June 2012, after West Ham and Green failed to agree new terms at the end of his contract, joint-chairman David Gold announced Green's departure from the club.\n\n"

Cavanaugh (Pamela Reed), uses an unscripted, impassioned hotel-room speech caught on camera as part of an advertising campaign focusing on Tanner's authenticity and integrity. Using the slogan \"For Real\", Tanner emerges from a wide field of contenders to battle for the nomination against two high-profile and better-funded candidates: Jesse Jackson and eventual nominee Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. With Tanner are his college-aged daughter Alexandra (Cynthia Nixon), whose illness was why he earlier left politics and who has left college for the duration\n\n"

With the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, all of the existing titles (with the exception of Pinocchio, Fantasia, The Fox and the Hound, The Great Mouse Detective, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin) in the Classics line were replaced with the Masterpiece Collection line, and the Classics line was cancelled in the United States and Canada. The company was originally established in 1953 as Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (later renamed to Buena Vista Distribution Company, Inc. and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc.). It took on its current name in 2007. Before 1953, Walt Disney's productions were distributed by Screen Gems (1924–1926), Film Booking Offices of America (1926–1927), Universal Pictures (1927–1928), Celebrity Productions (1928–1930), Columbia Pictures (1930–1932), United Artists (1932–1937, 1943), and RKO Radio Pictures (1937–1956). layouts and animators included Archie Bolina, Gener De Ocampo, Jerome Hiram Co, Jocelyn Sy, Jonathan Tinsay, Nowell Villano, Romy Garcia and Royce Ramos, projects of its both direct-to-video animated film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and DisneyToon Studios: Mickey's House of Villains produced by The Walt Disney Company) and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse, and The Fox and the Hound 2. Alice in Wonderland and Mary Poppins, but that 15 other animated movies would never be aired.

They provide comprehensive information on employment flows for workers (accession and separations), jobs (creations and destructions), and earnings for various demographic subgroups (age and gender), economic industry (NAICS industry groups), detailed geography (block, county, Core-Based Statistical Area, and Workforce Investment Area), and ownership (private, all). What sets the QWI apart is its inclusion of demographic and industry detail for both worker and job flow data. These details are compiled from underlying micro-data that have been integrated at the job and establishment levels by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program at the Census Bureau. It is important to note that the estimates presented in the QWI are compiled exclusively from public-use data series and are available for download. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), who has overall responsibility for GEOINT in the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), defines GEOINT as \"information about any object—natural or man-made—that can be observed or referenced to the Earth, and has national security implications.\" Web-enabled GIS applications allow for fast, efficient sharing and disseminating of geospatial data, products, and intelligence from the NGA to its allies, warfighters, partners, and other agencies across the World Wide Web.\n\n"

In 1287 or 1288, when Katherine was 15 or 16 years old, she married Baron Nicholas de Audley and had two sons and a daughter, the first when she was 17 years old. After both her husband and her father died in 1299, she came into a large inheritance, including lands and property in Carmarthenshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Cheshire. Various sources suggest she originally went missing on 25 February \n\n Mary Arundell was the only child of Sir John Arundell (c.1474 – 8 February 1545) of Lanherne, Cornwall, and his second wife, Katherine Grenville (born 1489-93), a daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (d.1513). Henry marries Catherine of Valois, daughter of Charles VI, and their heir would inherit both kingdoms. Henry's young son, Henry VI of England, who is 20 years, 323 days days old at the time, is crowned king of both England and France. This treaty disinherited the Dauphin Charles and handed the succession to Henry V through a marriage to Charles VI's daughter, Catherine of Valois. The treaty named Henry \"regent and heir of France\" (although the English only had effective control over northern France and Guyenne) until Charles's death.

In 1287 or 1288, when Katherine was 15 or 16 years old, she married Baron Nicholas de Audley and had two sons and a daughter, the first when she was 17 years old.

Various sources suggest she originally went missing on 25 February \n\n Mary Arundell was the only child of Sir John Arundell (c.1474 – 8 February 1545) of Lanherne, Cornwall, and his second wife, Katherine Grenville (born 1489-93), a daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (d.1513). Henry marries Catherine of Valois, daughter of Charles VI, and their heir would inherit both kingdoms. Henry's young son, Henry VI of England, who is 20 years, 323 days days old at the time, is crowned king of both England and France. This treaty disinherited the Dauphin Charles and handed the succession to Henry V through a marriage to Charles VI's daughter, Catherine of Valois. The treaty named Henry \"regent and heir of France\" (although the English only had effective control over northern France and Guyenne) until Charles's death. Despite his expectations, Henry V predeceased his sickly father-in-law by a few months, in 1422.

In Richard's absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip's conquests in the period of Richard's imprisonment was the Norman Vexin and a few towns around such as Le Vaudreuil, Verneuil and Évreux. ; 23 May: The Constable of France, Raoul I of Brienne, Count of Eu, receives his orders. ; May: Jeanne de Valois, \n\n1259: The Treaty of Paris between Henry III of England and Louis IX of France acknowledges the loss of most of the Angevin Empire. ; 1324: The War of Saint-Sardos between \n\n King Richard I of England had been captured and imprisoned by Leopold of Austria on the King's return from crusade in December 1192. For over a year, the terms of his release were negotiated, until he was released on payment of a massive ransom in January 1194. However, as soon as Richard returned to Normandy, John made his peace with him, abandoning Philip; Richard proceeded to unravel much of Philip's recent gains in the region, beginning with the raising of Philip's siege of Verneuil on 29 May 1194. There, Philip was forced into a hasty retreat, and, foreshadowing his losses at Fréteval, abandoned his siege engines and other valuable matériel.\n\n"

Bacon explains how his method is applied in his Novum Organum (published 1620). After the accession of Pope Clement IV in 1265, the Pope granted Bacon a special commission to write to him on scientific matters. In eighteen months he completed three large treatises, the Opus Majus, Opus Minus, and Opus Tertium which he sent to the Pope. William Whewell has called Opus Majus at once the Encyclopaedia and Organon of the 13th century. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method and pioneer in the scientific revolution. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution.

Bacon explains how his method is applied in his Novum Organum (published 1620). After the accession of Pope Clement IV in 1265, the Pope granted Bacon a special commission to write to him on scientific matters. In eighteen months he completed three large treatises, the Opus Majus, Opus Minus, and Opus Tertium which he sent to the Pope. William Whewell has called Opus Majus at once the Encyclopaedia and Organon of the 13th century. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method and pioneer in the scientific revolution. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution.

He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He is believed to have been buried in Chartreuse, where Bernard of Clairvaux attempted and failed to resurrect him. Helias was absent from the castle at the time, but before the Viscount arrived, the boy was taken out of Normandy to join Helias. Meanwhile, Robert de Beauchamp seized the castle of Saint-Saens and held it for Henry I, who then \n\n Robert Curthose or Robert II of Normandy (c. 1051 – 3 February 1134, Robert Courteheuse / Robert II de Normandie) was the eldest son of William the Conqueror and succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 1087, reigning until 1106. The epithet \"Curthose\" had its origins in the Norman French word courtheuse 'short stockings' and was apparently derived from a nickname given to Robert by his father; the chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Orderic Vitalis reported that William the Conqueror had derisively called Robert brevis-ocrea (\"short boot\"). Eventually, his disagreements with Henry I led to defeat in battle and lifelong captivity, with Normandy absorbed as a possession of England. During the period from 1104 to 1106, Helias supported Robert Curthose, but in 1106 after the Battle of Tinchebray (in which Robert Curthose was captured and imprisoned by Henry) Helias seems to have been on curiously good terms with Henry I.

He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He is believed to have been buried in Chartreuse, where Bernard of Clairvaux attempted and failed to resurrect him. Helias was absent from the castle at the time, but before the Viscount arrived, the boy was taken out of Normandy to join Helias. Meanwhile, Robert de Beauchamp seized the castle of Saint-Saens and held it for Henry I, who then \n\n Robert Curthose or Robert II of Normandy (c. 1051 – 3 February 1134, Robert Courteheuse / Robert II de Normandie) was the eldest son of William the Conqueror and succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 1087, reigning until 1106. The epithet \"Curthose\" had its origins in the Norman French word courtheuse 'short stockings' and was apparently derived from a nickname given to Robert by his father; the chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Orderic Vitalis reported that William the Conqueror had derisively called Robert brevis-ocrea (\"short boot\"). Eventually, his disagreements with Henry I led to defeat in battle and lifelong captivity, with Normandy absorbed as a possession of England. During the period from 1104 to 1106, Helias supported Robert Curthose, but in 1106 after the Battle of Tinchebray (in which Robert Curthose was captured and imprisoned by Henry) Helias seems to have been on curiously good terms with Henry I. Secure in his victory, Henry encountered young William Clito, Duke Robert's son, at Falaise.

He was a monk in the Pateron Monastery (Deir Al-Zugag). The Synaxarium links Simeon to his Syrian heritage by mentioning to his readers that Severus of Antioch was buried in the monastery. The Synaxarium attests to his saintly life. column called \"Simeon Stylites\", named after Saint Simeon Stylites, a 5th-century ascetic who lived on top of a pillar for 39 years. In 1972, Rutgers University Press published a compilation of 112 of Caldwell's \"Simeon Stylites\" as In the Record: the Simeon Stylites Columns of William A. Caldwell (1972).\n\n"

A recipe for pound cake is in the first U.S. cookbook, American Cookery, which was published in 1796. Over time the ingredients for pound cake changed. Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of Direction for Cookery, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges.

In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was \"one of the great achievements in human intellectual history\". O'Rourke describes Smith as the \"founder of free market economics\". Herbert Stein wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas.
