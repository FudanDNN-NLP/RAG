It was sixth race of the 1990 Formula One World Championship, the 14th Mexican Grand Prix and the fifth since the Mexico City circuit returned to the Formula One calendar in 1986. Prost, the 1988 race winner, became the second multiple-winner in Mexican Grand Prix history, joining British driver Jim Clark who won the race in 1962 (non-championship), 1963 and 1967. Pérez drove for the Campos Grand Prix team in the 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series, partnering Russian driver Vitaly Petrov. He was the first Mexican driver to compete at this level of motorsport since Giovanni Aloi took part in International Formula 3000 in 1990. He moved to Arden International for the main 2009 GP2 Series, driving alongside fellow Formula Three graduate Edoardo Mortara.

Plants of the genus owe their common name \"devil's claw\" to the peculiar appearance of their hooked fruit. Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Etymology The genera name is derived from the Greek words harpago meaning hook and phyton meaning plant. H. procumbens is one of the floral emblems of Botswana where it is thought to be useful in treating a variety of pain conditions. Ecology and management Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of\n\n Hibbertia exasperata is a species of flowering plant in the family Dilleniaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.

In 1900, John Isaac Briquet changed the name to Hibbertia exasperata. Clitoria ternatea, commonly known as Asian pigeonwings, bluebellvine, blue pea, butterfly pea, cordofan pea and Darwin pea, is a plant species belonging to the family Fabaceae. The flowers of this vine were imagined to have the shape of human female genitals, hence the Latin name of the genus \"Clitoria\", from \"clitoris\".

H. procumbens is one of the floral emblems of Botswana where it is thought to be useful in treating a variety of pain conditions. Ecology and management Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of\n\n Hibbertia exasperata is a species of flowering plant in the family Dilleniaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is an erect or straggling shrub that typically grows to a height of 10–60 cm with sharply-pointed leaves. It was first formally described in 1845 by Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae and was given the name Candollea exasperata. In 1900, John Isaac Briquet changed the name to Hibbertia exasperata. Clitoria ternatea, commonly known as Asian pigeonwings, bluebellvine, blue pea, butterfly pea, cordofan pea and Darwin pea, is a plant species belonging to the family Fabaceae. The flowers of this vine were imagined to have the shape of human female genitals, hence the Latin name of the genus \"Clitoria\", from \"clitoris\". The species name is thought to derive from the city of Ternate in the Indonesian archipelago, from where Linnaeus's specimens originated.\n\n"

Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to Pskov, where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to re-take the city. Kerensky narrowly escaped, and he spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in France. During the Russian Civil War, he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the White Movement.

Early edits of the film were shown to audiences at film festivals throughout 2019 as peer reviews. The film, its crews, and actors garnered forty-five awards and twenty-six nominations internationally. On March 7, 2017, T.J. Miller and Jessica Henwick joined the cast, and principal production was set to commence later that month in New Orleans. On April 5, 2017, during principal production, Vincent Cassel and Mamoudou Athie joined the cast, and the next day, John Gallagher Jr. was also added. Marco Beltrami & Brandon Roberts composed the film score. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating\n\n The Head Hunter (originally titled The Head) is a 2018 American fantasy horror film directed by Jordan Downey, who also co-wrote, produced, and edited the film. It stars Norwegian actor Christopher Rygh as the title character, Cora Kaufman, and Aisha Ricketts. The film centers on the title character, who works as a bounty hunter for a local kingdom, all the while he awaits the eventual return of the creature responsible for the murder of his daughter. Alastair Fothergill and Andy Byatt are credited as directors, and six cinematographers were also credited: Doug Allan, Mike deGruy, Peter Scoones, Simon King, Rick Rosenthal, and Bob Cranston. The idea for Deep Blue developed from when a shorter version of The Blue Planet was cut for The Proms in 2002 and for which George Fenton composed a score. Producer Sophokles Tasioulis said, \"There's not a single cut in the movie that's the same as the TV series.\" The film contains only 15 lines of narrative. Filmmakers enlisted Fenton to compose the film's score, which was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic in their cinematic debut.\n\n"

His final film as a producer was the 1991 film White Light, directed by Al Waxman; in the same year, he won a lifetime achievement award from the Canadian Film and Television Production Association. Peter Weir is an Australian film director. He was a leading figure in the Australian New Wave cinema movement (1970–1990), with films such as the mystery drama Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), the supernatural thriller The Last Wave (1977) and the historical drama Gallipoli (1981). The climax of Weir's early career was the $6 million multi-national production The Year of Living Dangerously (1983). After the success of The Year of Living Dangerously, Weir directed a diverse group of American and international films covering most genres—many of them major box office hits—including Academy Award-nominated films such as the thriller Witness (1985), the drama Dead Poets Society (1989), the romantic comedy Green Card (1990), the social science fiction comedy-drama The Truman Show (1998) and the epic historical drama Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003). For his work on these five films, Weir personally accrued six Academy Award nominations as either a director, writer or producer.\n\n"

This discovery is important as it adds to the growing knowledge of the genus Amazophrynella, increasing the number of formally described species to seven. Furthermore, the morphological and genetic distinctiveness of Amazophrynella javierbustamantei sets it apart from other known species within the genus. Its intermediate body size, tuberculate skin texture, distinct venter coloration, and unique molecular characteristics differentiate it from its relatives. It also underscores the importance of employing multiple approaches, such as morphology, genetics, and vocalizations, to accurately identify and classify species.\n\n"

Bala. Mum is marked as directorial debut of Akash Mihani. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of its independence in 1947, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. The music by Naushad introduced global music, including Western classical music and orchestra, to Hindi cinema. The films stars Anushka Shetty in the titular role while Jayaram (in his Telugu debut), Unni Mukundan, Murali Sharma, and Asha Sarath play other pivotal roles. Principal photography commenced in June 2016 in Hyderabad, and the film was released on 26 January 2018 in Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil along with a dubbed Hindi and Kannada version. With Bhaagamathie, Anushka Shetty emerged the second Indian actress after Sridevi to have a $1 million grosser at the US box office. The film is remade in Hindi as Durgamati (2020). R.

The 1993–94 double-winners Doncaster Belles and League Cup winners Arsenal Ladies continued their rivalry in the National Division. The runners-up were Liverpool Ladies, renamed in 1994 and previously known as Knowsley United. The 1992–93 season of the WFA National League Premier Division was the second season of national top-flight league women's football in England. Arsenal won their first women's National League title, two points ahead of the previous champions of 1991–92, Doncaster Belles. The 2–1 win for Arsenal against Doncaster in March at Highbury was instrumental in securing the championship, reportedly only the second defeat of Doncaster Belles in a league game in 15 years. The game (part of an Arsenal fundraising day for Michael Watson) had 18,196 fans, the Women's National League/Premier League attendance record. Arsenal also completed a Treble by defeating Doncaster Belles in the 1992–93 WFA Cup Final and then beating Knowsley United in the 1992–93 League Cup Final. Doncaster Rovers Belles were relegated to WSL 2, with nine new licences awarded to London Bees, Durham, Aston Villa, Millwall Lionesses, Yeovil Town, Reading, Sunderland, Watford, and Oxford United. Doncaster Belles appealed against their demotion, but were unsuccessful. Ball scored in every round of the WFA Cup, and her headed goal in the 3–0 final win over Doncaster Belles was the 38th of a prolific campaign. In April 1995, Ball, by then reduced to bit-part status, came on for the final two minutes of Arsenal's 3–2 FA Women's Cup final win over Liverpool Ladies. In 1995–1996 Ball played for Wembley Ladies – and won a last minute penalty kick as Wembley ultimately beat Doncaster Belles in the Premier League Cup final on 10 March 1996. Ball featured for Wembley in the following season's 1–0 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Millwall Lionesses.

The 1993–94 double-winners Doncaster Belles and League Cup winners Arsenal Ladies continued their rivalry in the National Division. The runners-up were Liverpool Ladies, renamed in 1994 and previously known as Knowsley United. The 1992–93 season of the WFA National League Premier Division was the second season of national top-flight league women's football in England. Arsenal won their first women's National League title, two points ahead of the previous champions of 1991–92, Doncaster Belles. The 2–1 win for Arsenal against Doncaster in March at Highbury was instrumental in securing the championship, reportedly only the second defeat of Doncaster Belles in a league game in 15 years. The game (part of an Arsenal fundraising day for Michael Watson) had 18,196 fans, the Women's National League/Premier League attendance record. Arsenal also completed a Treble by defeating Doncaster Belles in the 1992–93 WFA Cup Final and then beating Knowsley United in the 1992–93 League Cup Final. Doncaster Rovers Belles were relegated to WSL 2, with nine new licences awarded to London Bees, Durham, Aston Villa, Millwall Lionesses, Yeovil Town, Reading, Sunderland, Watford, and Oxford United. Doncaster Belles appealed against their demotion, but were unsuccessful. Ball scored in every round of the WFA Cup, and her headed goal in the 3–0 final win over Doncaster Belles was the 38th of a prolific campaign. In April 1995, Ball, by then reduced to bit-part status, came on for the final two minutes of Arsenal's 3–2 FA Women's Cup final win over Liverpool Ladies. In 1995–1996 Ball played for Wembley Ladies – and won a last minute penalty kick as Wembley ultimately beat Doncaster Belles in the Premier League Cup final on 10 March 1996. Ball featured for Wembley in the following season's 1–0 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Millwall Lionesses.

The novel reimagines the life of Bert Williams (1874—1922), the first black entertainer in the U.S. to achieve the highest levels of fame and fortune, while darkening his skin with burnt cork and \"playing the dim-witted 'coon' on Broadway and elsewhere\", a story that allows the author to deal with issues of race and identity that he also addressed in his novel A Distant Shore, as reviewer Tabish Khair notes: \"Dancing in the Dark explores the particular tensions of assuming a false identity which, in a racist society, would be considered the 'true' identity of the player. This catches the performer in the double bind of using the actor's art to confirm prejudices, which then blind their audiences to that art.\" The story also deals with \"the perils of self-invention, that have long plagued American culture\". The title refers to the protagonist, a middle-aged botanist named Arnold Brinkman, who takes his nephew to Yankee Stadium for a baseball game. \"When the stadium cameras inevitably find him,\" wrote reviewer Steve Donoghue, \"and put his picture up on the jumbo-tron for the fans and all the home viewers to see, Arnold does the unforgivable: he sticks out his tongue.\" He has written for The New York Times, The New Yorker, Artforum, Travel and Leisure, and other publications on a range of subjects, including depression, Soviet artists, the cultural rebirth of Afghanistan, Libyan politics, and Deaf politics. Honors awarded to Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity include the 2012 National Book Critics Circle Award, the Media for a Just Society Award of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the J.

In reality, Lütjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of antisemitic crimes during Kristallnacht. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Hitler salute when Hitler visited Bismarck before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute. He was pessimistic of the chances of success of Bismarcks mission and realised that it would be a daunting task. In 1887 the torpedo boats escorted Prince Wilhelm to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, Queen Victoria. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships. Kapitän zur See (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a Konteradmiral (rear admiral) in 1895. What depressed Lütjens's already darkened mood was Ernst Lindemann, Bismarck's captain, had been told by Karl Topp of the Marineamt, that several war games were run to see if Tirpitz could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lütjens' staff for Operation Rheinübung was made up of the following officers:\n\n Wolf Junge (5 January 1903 in Schwarzenberg / Saxe) was a German naval officer of World War II. As a Kapitän zur See, he was appointed the executive officer of the battleship Tirpitz in August 1943 under Kapitän zur See Hans Meyer.

        "context": " The film has been criticised for its portrayal of German Admiral Günther Lütjens, who is portrayed as a stereotypical Nazi, committed to Nazism and crazed in his undaunted belief that Bismarck is unsinkable. In reality, Lütjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of antisemitic crimes during Kristallnacht. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Hitler salute when Hitler visited Bismarck before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute. He was pessimistic of the chances of success of Bismarcks mission and realised that it would be a daunting task. In 1887 the torpedo boats escorted Prince Wilhelm to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, Queen Victoria. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships. Kapitän zur See (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a Konteradmiral (rear admiral) in 1895. What depressed Lütjens's already darkened mood was Ernst Lindemann, Bismarck's captain, had been told by Karl Topp of the Marineamt, that several war games were run to see if Tirpitz could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lütjens' staff for Operation Rheinübung was made up of the following officers:\n\n Wolf Junge (5 January 1903 in Schwarzenberg / Saxe) was a German naval officer of World War II. As a Kapitän zur See, he was appointed the executive officer of the battleship Tirpitz in August 1943 under Kapitän zur See Hans Meyer. Junge handed command of Tirpitz to Kapitän zur See Robert Weber in November 1944.\n\n"

The Cherokee was marketed as the \"sporty\" two-door variant of Jeep's station wagon. The term \"Sport Utility Vehicle\" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure. The initial, 1974 Cherokees were only available in the standard \"narrow track\" configuration as base models (Model 16), or top-of-the-line S models (Model 17). Later, the trim levels of the Cherokee included the S (Sport; 1974—), Chief (1976–1983), Golden Eagle (1978–1979), Golden Hawk, and Laredo (1980–1983). Cherokee Chief and Laredo packages were still available, but only on widewheel two-door models. For other vehicles using this name, see Jeep Cherokee. The Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a compact sport utility vehicle manufactured and marketed across a single generation by Jeep in the United States from 1983 to 2001 &mdash; and globally through 2014. Sharing the name of the original, full-size Cherokee SJ model, the 1984 XJ Cherokee was Jeep's first all-new design since the 1963 SJ Wagoneer, as well as the first American off-road vehicle built with fully integrated body-and-frame (unibody) design, and formed the mechanical basis for the Jeep Comanche (MJ) pickup truck (1985–1992). The compact Cherokee's design, appearance, and sales popularity spawned imitators as other automakers noticed that the Jeep XJ models began replacing regular cars.

In 1992, Claude Sautet co-wrote (with Jacques Fieschi) and directed Un Coeur en Hiver, considered by many to be a masterpiece. Mathieu Kassovitz's 1995 film Hate (La Haine) received critical praise and made Vincent Cassel a star, and in 1997, Juliette Binoche won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The English Patient. Some stylistic similarities have also been noted to Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's 1995 film The City of Lost Children, another film inspired particularly by Gilliam (Gilliam had presented Jeunet's and Caro's previous film Delicatessen in North America,  another film by Jeunet and Caro that was a deliberate homage to Gilliam's style). The success of Delicatessen allowed them to return to their early project — a science fantasy film The City of Lost Children which they conceived in the early 1980s, but weren't able to produce due to the lack of funding. Together they directed two animated shorts, L'évasion (The Escape, 1978) and Le manège (The Carousel, 1980) which was awarded the César Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 6th César Awards in 1981. In 1991 they directed their first feature film, a dark comedy Delicatessen which launched \n\n Delicatessen (Delikatessen) is a 1930 German romance film directed by Géza von Bolváry and starring Harry Liedtke, Georgia Lind, and Ernő Verebes.\n\n"

The venue is located at the north end of the Strip, north of Circus Circus Las Vegas. In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's \"community\".

The band was formed in 2004 by Rory Attwell and Sam Mehran, who were later joined by Devonte Hynes. Hynes and Mehran were both 18 years old at the time of the band's inception. Hynes and Mehran continued this trend throughout the existence of Test Icicles with the NLS Crew, a collective founded by the pair and whose most prominent output was a remix of Death from Above 1979's \"Black History Month\" single (which is available on DFA 1979's Romance Bloody Romance). According to the NME, Domino Recording Company signed Test Icicles near sight-unseen. The band started making music in 2010, and their members are lead vocalist and guitarist, Sef Idle, lead guitarist and background vocalist, Tyler Lewis, bassist and background vocalist, Seth Warren, and drummer and background vocalist, Phil Harris. The band has released four extended plays, Hymns of Punk Rock Praise, in 2010, I Refuse, in 2011, California or Bust, in 2013, and a split EP with the band, A Common Goal, Split Decision, in 2014, all with Thumper Punk Records. In 2013, Reynolds discovered the unsigned alternative band X Ambassadors. Their first studio album, Abdicate Self, was released in 2014 by Thumper Punk Records.\n\n"

In June 2006, to much industry interest, Rupert Murdoch invited Al Gore to make his climate change presentation at the annual News Corp (including the Fox Network) gathering at the Pebble Beach golf resort, (USA). In August 2007, Rupert Murdoch announced plans for News Corp. to be carbon neutral by 2010. It was founded in 1971 by Wharton School graduate Gilbert Harrison, whose experience in deals involving American Eagle, BCBG Max Azria, and Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, among others, has made him a sought-after source of expertise, which he was contributed at events such as the Financial Times Business of Luxury Summit. Their 2011 Annual CEO Panel was hosted by CNBC's Nicole Lapin. Panelists included Dan Schock (Google), Ben Fischman (Rue La La), Chip Wilson (lululemon), and Stephen Zangre (Facebook). A profile on Gilbert Harrison was featured in the March 2011 issue of The Deal titled, \"Relationship Advisory.\"\n\n"

John Reeves, the CBC producer of Whalley's adaptations of Levi and Agee, has written about the radio productions. After graduation from Meridian High School in 1956, in Agee attended Stanford University for one year before dropping out. During the summer of 1959, Agee, along with his parents, played the part of the Dixon family in the ephemeral film Last Clear Chance. Elephant is a 2003 American psychological drama film written, directed, and edited by Gus Van Sant. Elephant is the second film in Van Sant's \"Death Trilogy\"—the first is Gerry (2002) and the third Last Days (2005)—all three of which are based on actual events. Elephant was generally praised by critics and received the Palme d'Or at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, in which Patrice Chéreau was the head of the jury. The film was controversial for its subject matter and allegations of influence on the Red Lake shootings.\n\n"

Specifically, aldosterone stimulates the resorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephron. This leads to an increase in the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream, thereby promoting the retention of sodium by the body. Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels. As aldosterone levels increase, it leads to an increase in blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume, thereby inhibiting the release of renin. It acts on the distal tubules of the nephron in the kidney, as well as other sites like the gastric mucosa, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Through its actions, aldosterone helps to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as blood pressure regulation. In one study, transgenic mice over expressing this membrane protein were shown to have increased reabsorption and retention of sodium after increased salt intake. It primarily acts on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidney. This hormone influences the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium, indirectly affecting water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, interferes with the aldosterone receptor and has a similar effect. Reference: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above. Biosynthesis The corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol within the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the corticosteroid synthesis pathway that are cytochrome P450 oxidases. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans.

Additionally, aldosterone stimulates sodium retention in the distal colon and sweat glands through its receptors.
