The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients.

It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial. In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics.\n\n"

Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. The state, therefore, had financed its deficit spending by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts over the course of many years. The state, which had previously had a budget surplus, experienced a budget deficit of about $200 million in 2012. A supermajority of lawmakers in the Kansas legislature, both Democrats and Republicans, repealed the tax cut in June 2017, overriding Brownback's veto. There would be about $485 billion in safety net spending, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments and job training for low-income individuals, and a 25% increase in aid to disabled veterans.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths. All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission.

The artificial systems aren't organs and they aren't transplanted inside the body, says Steven Russell, assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the study published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care.

Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively.

For the older generation, balance and muscle endurance is improved by playing golf, which is likely to help in maintaining a strong cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic health status. \"Evidence suggests golfers live longer than non-golfers, enjoying improvements in cholesterol levels, body composition, wellness, self-esteem and self-worth,” explained Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Murray, from the physical activity for health research centre at the University of Edinburgh. \"Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages. “One study in Sweden found regular golfers lived an average of five years longer than non-golfers.\" He also added that only 55 million people – which equals about one per cent of the world’s population – actually indulge in golf as a sport or hobby. \"We have to get away from the idea golf's only a rich man's sport - 78 percent of the courses across the world are available for the public to play on, not just members.\" Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, playing golf has numerous physical and mental health benefits. The study reviewed 5,000 studies on golf and wellbeing and found that the sport has high physical and mental health benefits for individuals of all ages. Here are some of the benefits associated with playing golf:\n\n1. Increased life expectancy: The study found that golfers generally live longer, with an average increase in life expectancy of five years compared to non-golfers. Prevention of chronic diseases: Golf can help prevent 40 chronic diseases, including diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Regular golfing has been associated with improved cholesterol, body composition, wellness, self-esteem, and self-worth. Aid in chronic disease management: Golf can be beneficial for individuals already suffering from chronic diseases like heart disease, colon and breast cancer, type-2 diabetes, and stroke. Reduction in mental health issues: Playing golf has been linked to reduced anxiety levels, depression, and dementia risk.

        "context": "Researchers reviewed 5,000 studies into golf and wellbeing and found the sport has a very high physical and mental health benefit for people of all ages. For the older generation, balance and muscle endurance is improved by playing golf, which is likely to help in maintaining a strong cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic health status. \"Evidence suggests golfers live longer than non-golfers, enjoying improvements in cholesterol levels, body composition, wellness, self-esteem and self-worth,” explained Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Murray, from the physical activity for health research centre at the University of Edinburgh. \"Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages. “One study in Sweden found regular golfers lived an average of five years longer than non-golfers.\" He also added that only 55 million people – which equals about one per cent of the world’s population – actually indulge in golf as a sport or hobby. \"We have to get away from the idea golf's only a rich man's sport - 78 percent of the courses across the world are available for the public to play on, not just members.\" Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, playing golf has numerous physical and mental health benefits. The study reviewed 5,000 studies on golf and wellbeing and found that the sport has high physical and mental health benefits for individuals of all ages. Here are some of the benefits associated with playing golf:\n\n1. Increased life expectancy: The study found that golfers generally live longer, with an average increase in life expectancy of five years compared to non-golfers. Prevention of chronic diseases: Golf can help prevent 40 chronic diseases, including diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Regular golfing has been associated with improved cholesterol, body composition, wellness, self-esteem, and self-worth. Aid in chronic disease management: Golf can be beneficial for individuals already suffering from chronic diseases like heart disease, colon and breast cancer, type-2 diabetes, and stroke. Reduction in mental health issues: Playing golf has been linked to reduced anxiety levels, depression, and dementia risk. The sport provides an opportunity for outdoor exercise, social interaction, and relaxation, which contribute to better mental well-being. It's worth noting that golf can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from the very young to the elderly. So, if you're looking to improve your physical and mental health, golf can be a great activity to consider.\n\n"

Visine Original The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels. Administration Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily . Adverse effects Those using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application.

The U.S. Congress and the national legislatures of Canada and Mexico can strike a blow against cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and many other diseases by approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). If the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada is ratified, the prospects for future medical discovery look much brighter. This isn’t the only way the USMCA sets the stage for medical innovation. The trade deal also cracks down on foreign price controls. Currently, both Canada and Mexico artificially control the price of drugs. the Trump administration formally initiated the process to seek congressional approval of USMCA.

These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or child mortality.

Lack of prenatal care, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and drug use also cause complications which may result in infant mortality. Many environmental factors contribute to infant mortality, such as the mother's level of education, environmental conditions, and political and medical infrastructure. More than 60% of these deaths are seen as being avoidable with low-cost measures such as continuous breast-feeding, vaccinations and improved nutrition.

Classification Infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. The WHO lists the leading causes of maternal death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. The WHO also states that the reasons why so many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today include pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions (including peripartum cardiomyopathy), and ectopic pregnancy.

In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Any physician or other attending medical service provider who treats or consults on an animal bite or scratch incident is required to make a report to the local health department within 12 hours. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets.

But those are only two of the symptoms of rabies, and they typically occur only after the dog displays subtler symptoms, says Susan Nelson, DVM, associate clinical professor at the Veterinary Health Center at Kansas State University. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), cats are more prone to becoming aggressive, while dogs are more likely to be lethargic and non-responsive. Sadly, once symptoms appear, the animal will likely die within 10 days. Thanks to the rabies vaccine , which is required in the United States for domestic dogs and cats, the canine variant of rabies has been eliminated from the United States, says Nelson. But that doesn’t mean your pets cannot get rabies from wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes. Cats are more likely to contract rabies because they are more prone to wandering outside unsupervised and are less likely to be vaccinated against the disease . “In 2008, the number of rabies-infected cats was almost four times the number of rabies-infected dogs,” writes the AVMA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that unvaccinated dogs, cats and ferrets thought to have been infected with rabies be euthanized. However, if owners do not want to do this and their jurisdiction will allow it, they are required to keep their pet in a state-approved isolation facility (typically at their expense) for six months. Pets that have expired vaccinations are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the CDC. Pets that have been exposed to rabies and are up-to-date on vaccines must have the wound cleaned immediately and obtain another vaccine as soon as possible, as well as be put under observation for 45 days. Following this protocol ensures a nearly 100 percent survival rate in previously vaccinated pets, the AVMA says. Humans can also contract rabies, either from rabies-infected wild mammals or rabies-infected domestic pets. Most cases of rabies in humans in the United States come from bats, the AVMA says.

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. If you've just learned that your child is visually impaired, you are probably trying to sort out how serious the problem is, where to get help, and what this means for your child's future. In many cases, visual impairments can be corrected. If your child's visual impairment is serious, give yourself time to adjust. If detected early, temporarily patching the normal eye may resolve the problem by forcing the brain to use the affected eye. Cortical visual impairment (CVI). It can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment and blindness. If more severe, ROP can result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Genetically transmitted visual impairments. Infantile cataracts (a cloudy lens) and congenital glaucoma (a disorder that damages the optic nerve) often run in families. They can cause vision impairment. This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe.

CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them.

Gabbard supports a universal health care plan called \"Single Payer Plus\". Her plan is loosely modeled after Australia's healthcare system.

        "context": " O'Reilly opposed the nationalized health care plan that filmmaker Michael Moore argues for in his film Sicko, saying it would create huge backlogs. He also said, however, that he thinks the government should perform more oversight functions on health care: ...[G]overnment-run health care would be a disaster, featuring long waits for treatment and an enormous rise in taxation. But there should be government oversight on private insurance companies and strict guidelines about abusing customers. There can be compromise and effective government control of medical care abuse in the USA. But if Michael Moore's plan ever gets traction, pray hard you never get sick. Gabbard supports a universal health care plan called \"Single Payer Plus\". Her plan is loosely modeled after Australia's healthcare system. In 2017, she co-sponsored the Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act to create a national health insurance program that covers uninsured as well as underinsured people; allows for private insurance  supplemental to but not duplicative of benefits provided under the program; and paid for in part by raising taxes on the wealthy and taxing financial transactions. Gabbard called the Republican-sponsored American Health Care Act of 2017 \"really a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical companies that will further exacerbate the burden on American families.\" It introduced a number of mechanisms—including mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges—meant to increase coverage and affordability.

Coming off last year's deadly flu season, medical experts are urging people to get vaccinated now. Seasonal influenza, also known as flu, causes fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion and body aches. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter, the deadliest season in more than four decades. Among the deaths were 180 children, the majority of them unvaccinated, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome M. Adams said during a news conference last month. A flu vaccination can save lives, Bitonte said. Doctors' offices and area pharmacies have vaccinations on hand and are ready to administer them. Sporadic cases can take place all year, the Ohio Department of Health reports. When should you be vaccinated? Everyone but especially the very young and very old and those at a higher risk from a chronic medical condition, including those with compromised lungs that suffer from COPD, asthma, cancer and autoimmune diseases. There are some who should not get a flu shot, including those who could have a severe reaction to the vaccination or those with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. In a best case scenario, a person who got a flu shot might come down with the flu and it might mean a few days home from work or school. Worse case scenario, a person gets the flu and is hospitalized, may need a ventilator and could risk death, Bitonte said. Why do I have to get a flu shot every year? Bitonte said the flu bugs are smart and mutate and change, therefore last year's vaccination is not effective against this year's virus. Her death is a important reminder that flu can cause serious illness or death, particularly among persons at risk for flu-related complications. During the 2017-2018 flu season, New Mexico had more than 280 influenza (flu) and pneumonia-related deaths. It is an important additional form of protection because flu frequently causes types of pneumonia that can be prevented by the pneumococcal vaccine. People of any age with certain chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung or heart disease and those who are immuno-suppressed. People who might have flu – particularly if they are in the groups listed above at risk for severe disease and complications – should seek medical care and start antiviral medication as soon as possible. In 2009, the WHO reported that H1N1/09 seemed to be more contagious than seasonal flu. However, a New England Journal of Medicine report said the transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households was lower than that seen in past pandemics. 2009 H1N1 is a type of influenza (flu) virus that causes respiratory disease that can spread between people. Most people infected with this virus in the United States have had mild disease. Young children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes or heart disease may be at higher risk for complications from this infection. What’s the difference between 2009 H1N1 flu and seasonal flu? Both are influenza A strains that can cause illness. What are the signs and symptoms of 2009 H1N1 flu? Severe illness (e.g., pneumonia and respiratory failure) and deaths sometimes result from infection with an influenza virus and have been reported with this specific strain. Like seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 flu may worsen underlying chronic medical conditions. The 2009 H1N1 virus spreads like the seasonal flu. How long can an infected person spread 2009 H1N1 flu to others? People with 2009 H1N1 infection are potentially contagious as long as they have symptoms. Is there a vaccine for 2009 H1N1? Your co-workers and friends will start having cough, runny nose, congestion and fevers. You may be wondering, what is the difference between an upper respiratory infection also known as the common cold and influenza? Both influenza and colds are caused by viral infections. The common cold can be caused by more than 200 viruses, and can be spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. The treatment for a cold is symptom relief since antibiotics do no kill viruses. Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases and is a highly contagious airborne disease that occurs in seasonal epidemics. The influenza virus causes serious health issues and the CDC estimates that it is responsible for an average of more than 20,000 deaths annually. Medications are not available to the kill the influenza virus, but we have antiviral medications that can shorten the duration of illness by 1-2 days if the illness is diagnosed within the first 48 hours of onset. As you can see there are many similarities between colds and the flu, especially that they are both transmitted person to person via the air and close personal contact. While these similarities exist, it is important to note that the flu is a much more serious illness that can lead to death, especially in the pediatric and geriatric populations, and those with impaired immune systems.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves).

How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis? Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Different types of bacterial infection can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs.

Experts say getting a flu vaccination is essential to fighting the illness. The flu is hitting younger people harder this season than in years past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. People between the ages of 18 and 64 represent 61 percent of all influenza-related hospitalizations recorded during the current flu season — a significant increase compared with previous years when this age group represented about 35 percent of cases. More flu deaths than usual have also occurred in people under 65. Adults between 25 and 64 account for more than half of flu deaths this season, according to the CDC, compared with less than a quarter last year. “Therefore, it is critical that all pregnant and postpartum women get vaccinated to protect themselves against the flu. “We recommend that everyone, six months of age and older, receive either the influenza shot or the nasal spray vaccine and to practice basic hygiene, such as hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes, to prevent the spread of influenza and other respiratory diseases,” he said. CDC experts estimate only a third of people 18 to 64 had been vaccinated by November. The CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted this year’s flu vaccine reduces the chance of having to go to the doctor for treatment by about 60 percent across all age groups. In past years, the vaccine’s effectiveness has ranged from 30 percent to 65 percent. It’s included in all flu shots and nasal vaccines this year, according to the CDC report. Pregnant women are at particularly high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. A study of 345 participants aged 5–49 years who received the live influenza virus vaccine LAIV3, and for whom shedding was assessed by viral culture of nasal swabs (daily for days 1–7 post vaccination, every other day for days9 through 25, and on day 28) indicated that 30 percent had detectable virus in nasal secretions obtained by nasal swabbing. Local medical personnel will follow the recent recommendation handed down by the Centers for Disease Control to avoid using the nasal-spray flu vaccine, also known as FluMist. Dr. Ericka Kalp, director of epidemiology and infection prevention at Summit Health, said the nasal spray is made from a combination of live, weakened flu viruses, and was not particularly effective in recent flu seasons. \"The nasal spray was not very effective during the 2013-14 or 2015-16 flu seasons, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the spray not be used for this flu season,\" Kalp said. \"Summit Health concurs with the CDC’s recommendation that those wishing to be vaccinated against the flu receive the shot.\" The flu is a contagious respiratory illness with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. According to the CDC, that means \"no protective benefit could be measured.\" Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older. Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients. Children showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction to the then-new strain, while adults aged 18 to 64 had 6–9%, and older adults 34%.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The flu is hitting younger people harder this season than in years past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. People between the ages of 18 and 64 represent 61 percent of all influenza-related hospitalizations recorded during the current flu season — a significant increase compared with previous years when this age group represented about 35 percent of cases. More flu deaths than usual have also occurred in people under 65. Adults between 25 and 64 account for more than half of flu deaths this season, according to the CDC, compared with less than a quarter last year. “Therefore, it is critical that all pregnant and postpartum women get vaccinated to protect themselves against the flu. “We recommend that everyone, six months of age and older, receive either the influenza shot or the nasal spray vaccine and to practice basic hygiene, such as hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes, to prevent the spread of influenza and other respiratory diseases,” he said. CDC experts estimate only a third of people 18 to 64 had been vaccinated by November. The CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted this year’s flu vaccine reduces the chance of having to go to the doctor for treatment by about 60 percent across all age groups. In past years, the vaccine’s effectiveness has ranged from 30 percent to 65 percent. It’s included in all flu shots and nasal vaccines this year, according to the CDC report. Pregnant women are at particularly high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. A study of 345 participants aged 5–49 years who received the live influenza virus vaccine LAIV3, and for whom shedding was assessed by viral culture of nasal swabs (daily for days 1–7 post vaccination, every other day for days9 through 25, and on day 28) indicated that 30 percent had detectable virus in nasal secretions obtained by nasal swabbing. Local medical personnel will follow the recent recommendation handed down by the Centers for Disease Control to avoid using the nasal-spray flu vaccine, also known as FluMist. Dr. Ericka Kalp, director of epidemiology and infection prevention at Summit Health, said the nasal spray is made from a combination of live, weakened flu viruses, and was not particularly effective in recent flu seasons. \"The nasal spray was not very effective during the 2013-14 or 2015-16 flu seasons, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the spray not be used for this flu season,\" Kalp said. \"Summit Health concurs with the CDC’s recommendation that those wishing to be vaccinated against the flu receive the shot.\" The flu is a contagious respiratory illness with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. According to the CDC, that means \"no protective benefit could be measured.\" Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older. Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients. Children showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction to the then-new strain, while adults aged 18 to 64 had 6–9%, and older adults 34%.\n\n"

Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles.

The low-grade breast implants produced by the now closed French manufacture Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were made available in nearly all member states with the largest concentration in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. The implants - containing silicone made for use in mattresses - were banned in 2010 but France caused waves in December last year when it issued a cancer alert and advised French women to have the implants removed. The report found that “data available today was insufficient to lead to firm conclusions regarding the health risks for women with PIP silicone breast implants”. The evidence of health risks for women with PIP silicon breast implants, it concluded, is weak. But proven fraud, possible sub-standard screening processes in Europe, and recent revelations that the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) banned the company in 2000 are causing concern among MEPs in the European parliament. PIP obtained a permit for its saline implants in 1997 from the German certification company, TUV Rheinland. The manufacturer declared a medical-grade silicone but instead used an industrial alternative that is around ten times less expensive saving the company around €1.2 million per year, according to Reuters. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and then banned PIP saline implants in the United States in 2000 after inspecting the manufacturer’s premises in southern France. The FDA agent who inspected the site in 2000 said the implants had been “adulterated”, according to press reports.

An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat.

It is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and bloodstream infections. Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups. To conclude, Neisseria meningitidis is indeed a significant cause of meningitis, especially in children. In Russia, 13 children had been treated (5 with intensive care) by mid-June for a multisystem inflammatory syndrome at the Morozov Children's Hospital in Moscow, including a 2-year-old girl with the COVID-19 infection who died on 23 May following an initial diagnosis of suspected Kawasaki disease. In India, a \n\n from the disease. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria. It is usually (but not always) associated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Meningitis involves the inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Haemophilus meningitis is characterized by symptoms including fever, nausea, sensitivity to light, headaches, stiff neck, anorexia, and seizures. Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal, although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent, mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis. In infants, symptoms may include fever, irritability, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanel (soft spot on the head). In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups. To conclude, Neisseria meningitidis is indeed a significant cause of meningitis, especially in children. In Russia, 13 children had been treated (5 with intensive care) by mid-June for a multisystem inflammatory syndrome at the Morozov Children's Hospital in Moscow, including a 2-year-old girl with the COVID-19 infection who died on 23 May following an initial diagnosis of suspected Kawasaki disease. In India, a \n\n from the disease. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria. It is usually (but not always) associated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Meningitis involves the inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Haemophilus meningitis is characterized by symptoms including fever, nausea, sensitivity to light, headaches, stiff neck, anorexia, and seizures. Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal, although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent, mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis. In infants, symptoms may include fever, irritability, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanel (soft spot on the head). In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care.\n\n"

The Affordable Care Act, nicknamed “Obamacare,” was modeled on the Massachusetts law. “The mandate for all residents to purchase insurance coverage implies that insurance providers have to accept new applicants to their health plans based on minimum standards,” wrote the study’s co-author Philip Van der Wees, Ph.D., senior researcher at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands, in an email interview. “In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority acted as an exchange where regulated private insurance plans were offered to mostly previously uninsured residents.” Van der Wees was at Harvard during the study. After broader insurance coverage became available, residents of Massachusetts reported significant improvements in general, physical, and mental health, especially among those whose income was within 300 percent of the federal poverty level. “However, our results at state level in Massachusetts demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform at national level,” he added. CBO estimated in December 2015 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known colloquially as \"Obamacare\") would reduce the labor supply by approximately 2 million full-time worker equivalents (measured as a combination of persons and hours worked) by 2025, relative to a baseline without the law. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act came into effect, which impacted the definition of medical indigence in the United States. The act is credited as benefiting thousands of Americans while also being detrimental to others.

After broader insurance coverage became available, residents of Massachusetts reported significant improvements in general, physical, and mental health, especially among those whose income was within 300 percent of the federal poverty level. “However, our results at state level in Massachusetts demonstrate the potential benefits of health care reform at national level,” he added. CBO estimated in December 2015 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known colloquially as \"Obamacare\") would reduce the labor supply by approximately 2 million full-time worker equivalents (measured as a combination of persons and hours worked) by 2025, relative to a baseline without the law. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act came into effect, which impacted the definition of medical indigence in the United States. The act is credited as benefiting thousands of Americans while also being detrimental to others. Acts such as EMTALA ensure that every person coming into the emergency room must be treated regardless of insurance, with the patient left with the responsibility of paying the bill. Shared Responsibility Payment, which occurred as a result of not buying health insurance despite being able to afford it. While this mandate was aimed at increasing health insurance rates for Americans, it also led many individuals to sign up for relatively inexpensive health insurance plans that did not provide adequate health coverage in order to avoid the repercussions of the mandate. A major part of the United State’s healthcare system is health insurance.\n\n"

These guidelines apply only to women at average risk of developing breast cancer. The new guidelines demonstrate that if a woman and her physician want to reduce her risk of dying from breast cancer as much as possible, they would choose annual screening mammography beginning at age 40. To maximize the number of lives saved, Moffitt Cancer Center recommends annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 for women at average risk.

It’s important to note that the ACS and USPSTF guidelines apply only to women at average risk. Women with a family history of breast cancer, a personal history of breast cancer or other high-risk breast lesions, certain genetic mutations, or a history of chest radiation are NOT considered average risk. Increasing age is the second most important risk factor for breast cancer development. 75 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history. Screening only high-risk women, or using a risk-based approach to decide when to begin or how frequently a woman should undergo screening mammography, will miss many breast cancers.

The British parent company moved to dismiss the suit against it for lack of personal jurisdiction; the Law Division granted the motion. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court reversed the dismissal; the Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the Appellate Division's reversal of the Law Division's dismissal, holding that the foreign company had sufficient contacts with the state. As a talc supplier for Johnson & Johnson, the company was a co-defendant with Johnson & Johnson in mass tort litigation in the USA involving powder products that some consumers alleged to have contained asbestos and caused them to develop cancer. Imerys Talc America has always denied that its talc products contained asbestos and stands by the safety of its products. The $775 million settlement will be distributed among plaintiffs represented in approximately 25,000 active cases. Since J&J and Bayer co-developed the drug, they have agreed to split the amount equally. Plaintiffs in Xarelto lawsuits claimed the drug’s manufacturers had a responsibility to warn patients of its dangers and lack of antidote rather than focusing exclusively on its potential selling points. Most of the more than 27,000 lawsuits related to Xarelto were centralized in federal multidistrict litigation under MDL 2592. Just under 2,000 were consolidated within the Philadelphia Complex Litigation Center with lawsuits related to other anticoagulants. The settlement announced Monday applies only to cases within MDL 2592, but it comes as somewhat of a surprise after early bellwether trials heavily favored Bayer and J&J. Jury members determined that patients and physicians had been adequately warned about the drug’s potential risks and that plaintiffs were not entitled to damages. By the time a Philadelphia jury decided the first Risperdal trial, Janssen and J&J had already paid out massive amounts to the both the government and individuals to settle claims of illegal marketing and that the company minimized the risk of gynecomastia. In February 2015, the jury awarded him $2.5 million for J&J and Janssen’s negligence. The second Risperdal trial occurred just one month later, and again a jury found J&J and Janssen guilty of illegally marketing Risperdal to children. In both trials, the juries found J&J and Janssen were negligent in failing to warn patients of the risk of gynecomastia and awarded the third plaintiff $500,000 in December 2015 and the fourth plaintiff $1.75 million in November 2015. The fifth and most recent Risperdal trial saw the largest damage award so far in the litigation. The trial, which concluded this past July, awarded the plaintiff $70 million.

This was the first recorded human fatality from a leopard seal. It inhabits ice floes and waters of the north Pacific Ocean and adjacent seas. It is also found in Alaska from the southeastern Bristol Bay to Demarcation Point during the ice-free seasons of summer and autumn when spotted seals mate and have pups. Smaller numbers are found in the Beaufort Sea. The reduction in arctic ice floes due to global warming led to concerns that the spotted seal was threatened with extinction. mammals (imarpigmiutaq sg imarpigmiutaat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, imarpillar in Cup'ig) are only fin-footed species, such as seals and walruses. There are four species of seals in Alaska that are referred to as ice seals (or ice associated seals) because they use sea ice for some important life history events such as pupping, nursing, molting, and resting.

Health Director Dr. Bruce Anderson explained that the parasite that NOAA veterinarians found caused the deaths of the seals is far more impactful than just killing seals.” In addition to impacting marine mammals and wildlife, toxoplasmosis is a risk to humans. “The only thing certain about toxoplasmosis is that there are far more cases in humans and more deaths in seals, dolphins, native birds and other animals today than are recognized and reported,” said Anderson. “In addition to preying on native wildlife, cats pose a significant health risk to people, marine wildlife and birds,” Case explained. One of the seals, RK60, killed by toxoplasmosis gave birth to a pup on Moku Iki off shore from Lanikai in the spring of 2017. This seal and her pup moved to Moku Nui and were featured in a safe wildlife viewing video produced by DLNR and shown over the past year to thousands of people who rent from Kailua kayak rental firms (see video link below).

This was the first recorded human fatality from a leopard seal. It inhabits ice floes and waters of the north Pacific Ocean and adjacent seas. It is also found in Alaska from the southeastern Bristol Bay to Demarcation Point during the ice-free seasons of summer and autumn when spotted seals mate and have pups. Smaller numbers are found in the Beaufort Sea. The reduction in arctic ice floes due to global warming led to concerns that the spotted seal was threatened with extinction. mammals (imarpigmiutaq sg imarpigmiutaat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, imarpillar in Cup'ig) are only fin-footed species, such as seals and walruses. There are four species of seals in Alaska that are referred to as ice seals (or ice associated seals) because they use sea ice for some important life history events such as pupping, nursing, molting, and resting. This ice seals (ringed, bearded, spotted, and ribbon seals) are all used for subsistence by coastal Alaska Natives for food, oil, materials, clothing, and handicrafts. Sealskin is ideal for milder, damp weather as the hair provides very little insulation, however, sealskins are wind \n\n(Honolulu) – The recent deaths of three critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals on O‘ahu due to toxoplasmosis is very sad and could have been entirely preventable, according to a joint statement from the heads of the Hawai‘i Departments of Health (DOH) & Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Health Director Dr. Bruce Anderson explained that the parasite that NOAA veterinarians found caused the deaths of the seals is far more impactful than just killing seals.” In addition to impacting marine mammals and wildlife, toxoplasmosis is a risk to humans. “The only thing certain about toxoplasmosis is that there are far more cases in humans and more deaths in seals, dolphins, native birds and other animals today than are recognized and reported,” said Anderson. “In addition to preying on native wildlife, cats pose a significant health risk to people, marine wildlife and birds,” Case explained. One of the seals, RK60, killed by toxoplasmosis gave birth to a pup on Moku Iki off shore from Lanikai in the spring of 2017. This seal and her pup moved to Moku Nui and were featured in a safe wildlife viewing video produced by DLNR and shown over the past year to thousands of people who rent from Kailua kayak rental firms (see video link below). In Hawai‘i, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has recorded at least eleven Hawaiian monk seal deaths that\n\n On March 28, 2008, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiated a status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this ice seal species under the ESA was warranted.\n\n"

The battle to eradicate polio from the globe received another serious setback with the rise of number of children stricken with polio in Indonesia. One was confirmed on the island of Sumatra, which until last week was considered polio-free, said Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesman for the World Health Organization's polio eradication program in Geneva. Dr. Bardan Jung Rana, a WHO medical officer in Indonesia, said the rise was not unexpected. Early May, the World Health Organisation confirmed that an 18-month-old child had been paralysed by polio in a village in west Java, Indonesia. WHO records show that several dozen patients in Indonesia developed polio after being vaccinated against the disease in the late 1990's. Since 2001, Indonesia has recorded no polio infections at all. The virus found in the Indonesian case closely matches samples collected in an outbreak in recent months in Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The WHO says with the Indonesian case, 16 countries have had wild-virus outbreaks since 2003. The polio virus enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with the stool of an infected person. There are two kinds of polio vaccine—oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses weakened poliovirus, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while the OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immunodeficient. Nigeria is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of wild poliovirus, with its last reported case in 2016. Wild poliovirus has been eradicated in all continents except Asia, and , Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two countries where the disease is still classified as endemic. Factors influencing eradication of polio Eradication of polio has been defined in various ways—as elimination of the occurrence of poliomyelitis even in the absence of human intervention, as extinction of poliovirus, such that the infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory, as control of an infection to the point at which transmission of the disease ceased within a specified area, and as reduction of the worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis to zero as a result of deliberate efforts, and requiring no further control measures. In India, vaccination against polio started on 1985 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The number of reported cases of polio also declined from thousands during 1987 to 42 in 2010.

At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive.

        "context": "Addressing his television audience on Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel tearfully thanked the doctors and nurses who saved the life of his son, born last week with a congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with Pulmonary Atresia (PA). At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive.

According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. The lawsuit is: Lampkin v. GlaxoSmithKline, et al, case number RG15761042 in the Superior Court for California, County of Alameda. The Lampkin case, which was filed March 6, marks at least the third Zofran lawsuit to be filed against GSK since last month, all of which allege the drug caused serious congenital birth defects. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication. September 1 – Lawsuit filed today in the Central District of California by a mother who blames GSK for failing to warn about the risk of birth defects from Zofran.

China also surpassed both the U.S. and Europe in terms of annual sales of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles since 2015. Daimler and another partner, BYD Auto (backed by Warren Buffett), were already manufacturing an electric car for the Chinese market, the Denza, with an improved Denza 500 announced in March 2018. Apparently, Daimler-Benz was also having discussions about making battery-powered Smart cars in China with BYD Auto, according to an August 2018 report; the company would not comment on this topic.

Descriptive results show that the mean out-of-pocket costs of DMT per month were higher for patients with coinsurance than for patients with copayments. April 6, 2007;22:890-891. Goldman, DP, et al. This study examined the effects of increased Cost sharing, implemented by many health plans to discourage use of expensive drugs and reduce drug spending. Doubling Co-payments was associated with significant reductions in use of 8 therapeutic classes—including a 25% decrease in the use of anti-diabetic medication. The authors raise concerns that reduction in use of medications for individuals with Chronic conditions will result in more costly health consequences. July 4, 2007;298(1):61-69. http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/298/1/61. This literature review was undertaken to understand the association betweenCost sharing features in drug Benefits and the use of prescription drugs, and/or use of non-pharmaceutical services and health outcomes. The studies show “increased Cost sharing is associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users and more frequent discontinuation of therapy.” For congestive heart failure, lipid disorders, diabetes and schizophrenia, higher cost burden on the patient for prescription medications was associated with greater utilization of expensive inpatient and emergency medical services.\n\n"

However, there are major government programs that play a role in healthcare allocation. These programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities. It helps cover the cost of hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home healthcare services.

Despite evidence from trials showing improved outcomes for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of age, only 50 percent of patients aged 75 and older received adjuvant chemotherapy. For this plan to work, every single American would have to take full advantage of the best medical care the country has to offer. If they were to do so, the country’s cancer mortality rate would fall by 22%, according to researchers from the American Cancer Society. The law, better known as the ACA or Obamacare, has improved Americans’ access to healthcare in the states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. In the U.S., good healthcare often starts with good health insurance, and the ACA has provided a boost there too. In states that expanded Medicaid, the proportion of adults who lacked health insurance when they were first diagnosed with cancer fell from 9.6% in 2011 to 3.6% in 2014. Meanwhile, in states that did not expand Medicaid, the proportion fell only slightly, from 14.7% in 2011 to 13.3% in 2014. That ACA also allowed children to stay on their parents’ health insurance up to age 26, a provision that boosted insurance coverage among 19-to-25-year-olds by 7%.

Even so, as the 176 study participants increased the amount of fish they ate weekly, their disease activity score lowered, the observational study found. The new study, which was heavily female, draws attention to the link between diet and arthritic disease, a New York City specialist said. Consumption of fish was counted if it was cooked -- broiled, steamed, or baked -- or raw, including sashimi and sushi. Almost 20 percent of participants ate fish less than once a month or never, while close to 18 percent consumed fish more than twice a week. Researchers can't prove that the fish was responsible for the improvements. And they theorized that those who regularly consumed fish could have a healthier lifestyle overall, contributing to their lower disease activity score. Evidence from epidemiological, animal, and in vitro studies suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for Parkinson's disease. Rural living, well-drinking, and farming were also associated with Parkinson's, which may be partly explained by pesticide exposure. But studies into the association between diet and cancer show that food can have an impact in preventing cancer, or in reducing the aggressiveness of the disease. At the American Association for Cancer Research’s Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in November 2006, investigators have found that eating fish regularly as an adult can help to protect against development of colon cancer. Men who ate fish five times a week or more had a 40 percent lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to men who ate fish less than once a week, according to a new analysis of data from 22,071 participants in the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS). The researchers say the reduction in colorectal cancer risk is substantial in comparison to other dietary components, and while they don’t suggest that everyone starts eating fish daily simply because of these results, they say the health benefits of fish consumption have already been proven. “We already know that eating fish can reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, and this might provide another reason to add fish to your diet,” said Megan Phillips, a doctoral student at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of this study. Neptune krill oil is another important source of Omega-3 DHA and EPA. “We thought that maybe for men who received aspirin, it wouldn’t matter whether they ate fish or not,” Phillips said. The researchers looked at four different categories of fish consumed - tuna fish, dark meat fish (salmon, sardines, bluefish, etc. ), a general fish category, and shellfish including shrimp, lobster and scallops - and asked how many times the participants ate them on average during the previous year.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Consumption of fish was counted if it was cooked -- broiled, steamed, or baked -- or raw, including sashimi and sushi. Almost 20 percent of participants ate fish less than once a month or never, while close to 18 percent consumed fish more than twice a week. Researchers can't prove that the fish was responsible for the improvements. And they theorized that those who regularly consumed fish could have a healthier lifestyle overall, contributing to their lower disease activity score. Evidence from epidemiological, animal, and in vitro studies suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for Parkinson's disease. Rural living, well-drinking, and farming were also associated with Parkinson's, which may be partly explained by pesticide exposure. But studies into the association between diet and cancer show that food can have an impact in preventing cancer, or in reducing the aggressiveness of the disease. At the American Association for Cancer Research’s Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in November 2006, investigators have found that eating fish regularly as an adult can help to protect against development of colon cancer. Men who ate fish five times a week or more had a 40 percent lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to men who ate fish less than once a week, according to a new analysis of data from 22,071 participants in the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS). The researchers say the reduction in colorectal cancer risk is substantial in comparison to other dietary components, and while they don’t suggest that everyone starts eating fish daily simply because of these results, they say the health benefits of fish consumption have already been proven. “We already know that eating fish can reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, and this might provide another reason to add fish to your diet,” said Megan Phillips, a doctoral student at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of this study. Neptune krill oil is another important source of Omega-3 DHA and EPA. “We thought that maybe for men who received aspirin, it wouldn’t matter whether they ate fish or not,” Phillips said. The researchers looked at four different categories of fish consumed - tuna fish, dark meat fish (salmon, sardines, bluefish, etc. ), a general fish category, and shellfish including shrimp, lobster and scallops - and asked how many times the participants ate them on average during the previous year.\n\n"

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\n Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs.

They are: Prematurity High exposure to oxygen Low birth weight Various types of infections Cardiac defects Anaemia Low vitamin E level Pathophysiology During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment.

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable.

It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are: Prematurity High exposure to oxygen Low birth weight Various types of infections Cardiac defects Anaemia Low vitamin E level Pathophysiology During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment.

However, the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Committee,which determined the safety and efficacy of the treatment, believedphysicians who provide care for premature infants should be informedof these findings. Study investigators examined 3862 premature infants whose low birth-weight put them at risk for ROP. However, 291 infants developed severe ROP and, after the informed consent of their parents was obtained, were entered into the cryotherapy study. The preliminary results concern 172 of these infants.

A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" Many Testim lawsuits have already been filed against Endo for injuries caused by the testosterone gel. Testosterone regulates growth and the development of male gender characteristics. When applied topically, Testim gel increases bone density, muscle growth and libido, enhances sexual function and increases energy levels. The formulation was designed for use in men aged 18 and older who do not produce enough natural testosterone due to a malfunction of the testes, known as hypogonadism. Unfortunately, many men have been prescribed testosterone gel and replacement therapy for age-related decline of male hormones or “low-T” which has been a popular advertising subject. This use of testosterone is not approved by the FDA and may increase the chance for serious complications. March 2015, the FDA ordered Testim and other testosterone manufacturers to update product labels with information about an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. In June of 2015, the labels were again updated to include a warning regarding a risk of\n\n"

Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Tick-borne diseases, which afflict humans and other animals, are caused by infectious agents transmitted by tick bites. With summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease.

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY WHEN IT IS EXPOSED TO EMF RADIATION? THE DANGER: Unwanted cell death occurs releasing the micronuclei from the disrupted DNA repair into the fluid between cells (interstitial fluid) where they are free to replicate and proliferate. In the blood-brain barrier, for example, cells can not keep dangerous chemicals from reaching the brain tissue, which results in damage. Dr. George Carlo: The cellphone industry’s own research program concluded cellphone radiation was damaging to consumer’s health. Dr. George Carlo, was the cellphone industry’s Director of Research who was hired to run their $28 million dollar, 7 year research program to find out if cellphones were dangerous. Dr. George Carlo presents and reveals how the information-carrying radio waves from cell phones and other wireless technology are causing biological harm. Dr. Carlo says that when our cells are hit by EMF radiation, the cells regard the information-carrying radio waves as unrecognizable foreign toxins. But they carry on using it.\n\n"

The lawsuit alleged that the company's talcum powder products contained asbestos and that, after several years of use, had caused each of the women's ovarian cancer. The trial lasted six weeks and resulted in $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages being awarded to the plaintiffs. According to researchers at the Tisch Cancer Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, there is a significant link between women's talcum powder use and ovarian cancer. Although Johnson & Johnson asserts that their talc products are safe, they lost several talcum powder lawsuits in 2016. Juries ordered the company to pay substantial amounts to women with ovarian cancer. On 10 August 2018, Dewayne \"Lee\" Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was awarded $289 million in damages (later cut to $78 million on appeal then reduced to $21 million after another appeal )) after a jury in San Francisco found that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide.

On appeal in federal court, the judgment was reduced to US $5,000, the estimated value of Silkwood's losses in property at her rental house, and reversing the award of punitive damages. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court restored the original verdict, in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp. 464 US 238 (1984), ruling that \"the NRC's exclusive authority to set safety standards did not foreclose the use of state tort remedies.\" Although suggesting it would appeal on other grounds, Kerr-McGee settled out of court for US $1.38 million ($3.75 million in 2021 dollars), admitting no liability.

The grant, the largest single donation to Rush since its founding in 1837, will expand a Wounded Warrior Project-funded program that provides three weeks of concentrated post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, an approach that has been proven to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, symptoms. The Road Home Program was launched in 2014 to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, regardless of the ability to pay. The new funding will make the IOP available to more than 1,500 veterans over the next five years. Because spouses, children and other family members also are affected when their loved one experiences a trauma-based mental health issue, Road Home Program provides free services to family members.

The grant, the largest single donation to Rush since its founding in 1837, will expand a Wounded Warrior Project-funded program that provides three weeks of concentrated post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, an approach that has been proven to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, symptoms. The Road Home Program was launched in 2014 to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, regardless of the ability to pay. The new funding will make the IOP available to more than 1,500 veterans over the next five years. Because spouses, children and other family members also are affected when their loved one experiences a trauma-based mental health issue, Road Home Program provides free services to family members. As many as one in three veterans who served in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have returned to the United States with what are called the “invisible wounds of war,” including PTSD, traumatic brain injury and related mental health conditions associated with their military service. “It is critical that the general health care system steps up to do its share to care for our servicemen and servicewomen, and their families, who have given so much for our country. This support and generosity from Wounded Warrior Project are enabling us at Rush to provide the leading-edge care and services that our warriors and their families so dearly earned,” said Mark Pollack, MD, professor and chairperson of the Rush Department of\n\nEligibility: VA may provide domiciliary care to veterans whose annual gross household income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to veterans who the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines have no adequate means of support. The Domiciliary Care Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs provides residential rehabilitative and clinical care to veterans who have a wide range of problems, illnesses, or rehabilitative care needs which can be medical, psychiatric, substance use, homelessness, vocational, educational, or social. The VA Domiciliary Care Program also provides rehabilitative care for homeless veterans. The CLC provides a variety of health care programs for Veterans: long-term care, short-term rehabilitation therapy, respite care, and palliative care. The program is staffed by a social worker, a geriatrician, and by professionals from the CLC. Veterans who are medically stable and free from disruptive behavior usually stay on respite care for 11 days at a time, not to exceed four weeks in any calendar year. We have both on-site respite in the CLC and in-home respite for patients who prefer that option. The program is staffed by Geriatricians, physical and occupational therapists, and other health care professionals at the CLC. The clinics are staffed by Geriatricians, with input from social workers, pharmacists, or other professionals as needed. Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) provides at-home medical, nursing, social services, pharmacy, nutritional, psychological, and rehabilitative therapy for eligible Veterans whose disabilities prevent them from attending medical clinics for primary care. This program, which consists of\n\n The VHA has expanded its outreach efforts to include men and women veterans and homeless veterans. Several newer VA medical centers have been purposely located adjacent to medical schools. The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a \"seamless transition\" to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan. VA provides nursing home services to Veterans through three national programs: VA owned and operated Community Living Centers (CLC), State Veterans' Homes owned and operated by the states, and the community nursing home program. Nursing home care is available for enrolled Veterans who need nursing home care for a service-connected disability, or Veterans or who have a 70 percent or greater service-connected disability and Veterans with a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability. VA provided nursing home care for all other Veterans is based on available resources. Domiciliary care provides rehabilitative and long-term, health maintenance care for Veterans who require some care, but who do not require all services provided in nursing homes. VA may provide domiciliary care to Veterans whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to Veterans who have no adequate means of support.\n\n"

Therefore, some food companies are trying to give their halal products a low profile because of such reactions. After Labeyrie, France's biggest foie gras producer by revenue and a unit of food company Alfesca launched a halal foie gras, some bloggers accused it of funding Islamic extremists. As a result, it sells its halal pâté in a few stores and doesn't advertise it on the company website. The \"beurgeois\" among France's estimated 6 - 7 million-strong Muslim community are an emerging economic demographic, being catered to by a market in halal food and drinks. It is thus an important meat producer and, with its oversized liver, a source of foie gras. The birds may also be a source of goose down.

After Labeyrie, France's biggest foie gras producer by revenue and a unit of food company Alfesca launched a halal foie gras, some bloggers accused it of funding Islamic extremists. As a result, it sells its halal pâté in a few stores and doesn't advertise it on the company website. The \"beurgeois\" among France's estimated 6 - 7 million-strong Muslim community are an emerging economic demographic, being catered to by a market in halal food and drinks.

According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support. However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. Participants from Oakland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Birmingham were repeatedly measured for pulmonary function, height, smoking behavior, and waist circumference and asked about cigarette and marijuana smoking during each assessment. “People who smoke marijuana inhale very deeply, which may strengthen the muscles used for inhalation – basically making them good at the test. Subjects who smoked larger amounts of marijuana, which Pletcher described as smoking one joint per day, did show evidence of reduced pulmonary function, and he stressed that his study results are not intended to encourage people to use marijuana. However, for patients for whom medical marijuana may be a treatment option, the authors write that \"marijuana may have beneficial effects on pain control, appetite, mood, and management of other chronic symptoms. Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for these or other purposes may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function. It’s important to note that the findings of this study are not meant to encourage marijuana smoking, nor did the study examine other known negative effects of marijuana use, which include problems with memory, concentration and perception. In addition, while there are no fatal overdose cases linked to marijuana, there are deaths linked to synthetic cannabinoids each year. Now, a recent study reveals that heavy marijuana use could compromise the dopamine system. Heavy marijuana use is linked with decreased dopamine release in the brain, researchers say. The researchers, who publish their work in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, say that heavy cocaine and heroin use have been shown to decrease dopamine release, but until now, such data regarding cannabis was notably absent. To further investigate whether marijuana dependence is linked with similar effects, the researchers conducted their study in 11 adults aged 21-40 years who were heavily dependent on marijuana, and they matched them with 12 healthy controls. The adults in the marijuana group started using it at around age 16 on average, became dependent by age 20 and had been dependent for around 7 years.

Because of the virus's ability to rapidly respond to selective pressures imposed by the immune system, the population of virus in an infected individual typically evolves so that it can evade the two major arms of the adaptive immune system; humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (mediated by T cells) immunity. Second, HIV isolates are themselves highly variable. Therefore, the immune responses raised by any vaccine need to be broad enough to account for this variability. Any vaccine that lacks this breadth is unlikely to be effective. However, the well-proven route of trying to induce neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has stalled because of the great difficulty in stimulating antibodies that neutralise heterologous primary HIV isolates. For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS.

The millions of vehicles in the area combined with the additional effects of the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex frequently contribute to further air pollution. Los Angeles was one of the best known cities suffering from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that Los Angeles was a synonym for smog.

A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland. Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs. Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). Confirmed cases were generally transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital's Infectious Disease Centre for isolation and centralized treatment. On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Furthermore, its proximity to China and its millions of mainland visitors annually would make it vulnerable. In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes such as wearing masks likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March. Others attributed the success to critical thinking of citizens who have become accustomed to distrusting the competence and political motivations of the government, the World Health Organization, and the Chinese Communist Party. After a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020 caused by overseas returnees rushing to beat mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July, with more than a hundred cases being reported several days in a row until early August.

        "context": " The initial outbreak of the pandemic in China coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland. Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs. Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). Confirmed cases were generally transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital's Infectious Disease Centre for isolation and centralized treatment. On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points – Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open. Furthermore, its proximity to China and its millions of mainland visitors annually would make it vulnerable. In a study published in April 2020 in the Lancet, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes such as wearing masks likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March. Others attributed the success to critical thinking of citizens who have become accustomed to distrusting the competence and political motivations of the government, the World Health Organization, and the Chinese Communist Party. After a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020 caused by overseas returnees rushing to beat mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July, with more than a hundred cases being reported several days in a row until early August.

The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".

Benzene causes leukemia and is associated with other blood cancers and pre-cancers of the blood. It’s a known human carcinogen – a substance known to cause cancer. It’s benzene. For more than a century, it has been known that excessive exposure to benzene damages the bone marrow, resulting in aplastic anemia, a blood disorder in which the body’s bone marrow doesn’t make enough new blood cells (aplastic anemia is also called bone marrow failure). During the last few decades, it has become clear that long-term exposure to benzene can also cause leukemias and lymphomas. A few days ago (July 29, 2013), a new study on benzene and its association to lymphomas was published on line in Cancer, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. Results from the study show that the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is significantly higher in regions near facilities that release benzene into the environment. This group examined the associations between new cases of lymphoma and the locations of facilities—such as petroleum refineries and manufacturing plants—that released benzene into the surrounding air or water. The group found that, in areas located around benzene-release sites, the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was significantly greater than expected. The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma decreased as the distance from benzene-release sites increased (for every additional mile of distance, there was a 0.31 percent decrease in the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The investigators hope that their results will inform the public about the potential risks of living near facilities that release carcinogens into the air, groundwater, or soil.

The findings are preliminary, and the therapy remains experimental, the researchers pointed out. But experts said the results are encouraging considering the outlook these AML patients faced before the trial. But he also urged caution: The early phase trial was designed primarily to test the NK therapy's safety.

They also genetically armed the virus so it prompts cancer cells to secrete Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).\" The microbubbles can also be paired with complexes made to bind to specific areas of the body, allowing them to be targeted. In this study, a weakened adenovirus (a virus that is typically associated with respiratory infections) engineered to deliver the tumor-suppressing gene mda-7/IL-24 was joined to the microbubbles and delivered through the blood stream directly into the prostate. \"The study, done in mouse models of metastatic melanoma that had spread to the brain, has\n\n of ADA injections may impair the success of gene therapy, since transduced cells will have no selective advantage to proliferate if untransduced cells can survive in the presence of the injected ADA. In 2000, a gene therapy \"success\" resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. These trials were stopped when it was discovered that two of ten patients in one trial had developed leukemia resulting from the insertion of the gene-carrying retrovirus near an oncogene. In 2007, four of the ten patients have developed leukemias. Work aimed at improving gene therapy is now focusing on modifying the viral vector to reduce the likelihood of oncogenesis and using zinc-finger nucleases to further target gene \n\nGene therapy with an autologous stem cell transplant – Italian researchers at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute tested a novel approach combining gene therapy with an autologous stem cell transplant. ; Gene therapy for late infantile and early juvenile patients was approved by the European Commission in December 2020 after receiving a favorable European Medicines Agency CHMP review in October 2020. These cells are transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector \n\nAML is a cancer of the blood cells that mostly strikes older adults. An experimental therapy that revs up the immune system's cancer-fighting ability may help treat some leukemia patients who face a grim prognosis, a small study suggests. The treatment involves infusions of \"natural killer\" (NK) cells taken from a healthy donor and chemically \"trained\" to go after tumor cells. The findings are preliminary, and the therapy remains experimental, the researchers pointed out. But experts said the results are encouraging considering the outlook these AML patients faced before the trial. But he also urged caution: The early phase trial was designed primarily to test the NK therapy's safety.

One reason is the shift in the source of marijuana supply from foreign to domestic. Changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana also play a role in the perceived increase in potency. Testing artifacts, such as improved testing methods and increased accuracy in measuring THC levels, may contribute to the apparent rise in potency. A study using data from the Potency Monitoring Program found that when adjusting for marijuana quality, the reported increase in THC% between the 1970s and the 2000s is estimated to be about 57-67% as great as initially reported. This suggests that the long-term rise in potency may be slightly overestimated due to data quality issues and the need to account for the quality of the tested marijuana. In conclusion, the increased potency of marijuana in the USA can be attributed to a combination of factors including the shift to domestic cultivation, advancements in cultivation techniques, and changes in testing procedures. Cannabis users whose first experience with the drug is with potent “skunk” strains are nearly five times more likely to go on to show signs of dependence, US researchers have said. “THC has linearly increased over two decades,” said Dr Brook Arterberry, an assistant professor of psychology at Iowa State University who led this research. In annual follow-ups, users who reported that they had started smoking skunk – with an average THC content of 12.3 per cent – were 4.8 times more likely to have one or more symptoms of cannabis use disorder when compared to those smoking a 4.9 per cent strain. Cannabis is not typically thought of as addictive in the same way as heroin, cocaine, or even alcohol, where withdrawal can have serious physical health effects. \"Street\" jargon includes: blunts (hollowed-out cigars packed with marijuana), colas (buds of the cannabis plant, which are preferred by marijuana users because of their higher content of delta-9-THC, the active ingredient in marijuana), and hashish or hash (the most potent form, which comes from the resin of the cannabis plant when it is separated from the plant material). The major or most potent psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is THC. THC is present in marijuana in concentrations from 2–15%. The source of marijuana determines its THC concentration, depending upon the species, growth environment, part of the plant that is harvested, and where it comes from. However, the greater euphoria of higher-potency marijuana can lead to more marijuana use and abuse, as well as more side effects. The most common route of administration of marijuana is smoking, although some is ingested orally in homemade foods (e.g., brownies) or in a pharmaceutical product known as dronabinol (Marinol). When smoked, THC enters the circulation almost immediately, reaching high blood levels in 5–10 minutes. The metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.Although there is a severe shortage of good information about the sociological and long-term effects of marijuana, there is no shortage of information on where THC acts in the brain.A number of studies have isolated the \"cannabinoid receptor\" (CB), which appears to be distributed widely throughout the CNS (Pertwee, 2006). There are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Can I use marijuana and go to work?3.I strongly advise my patients to avoid them.I believe the risk of dabbing and the use of strong concentrates, e.g., shatter and wax, far outweighs their benefit, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood.Careful attention to an individual's mental health history, such as a diagnosis of addiction, depression, anxiety, or a mood disorder, or a family history of addiction, should serve as a warning to the possibility of marijuana being a potential problem. Behavioral support has been effective in treating marijuana addiction. Marijuana potency has steadily increased over the past two decades. THC content increased from 3.7 to 7.5 percent in the early 1990s to 9.6 to 16 percent in 2013. The highest-potency marijuana flower available today contains at most 25 to 30 percent THC. But the concentrates can contain up to 95 percent or more THC. The effect is so intense and the addiction potential so much greater that they have been described as the \"crack cocaine of marijuana.\" Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain (especially the developing brain) are exposed to extremely high concentrations of THC or whether the recent increases in emergency department visits by people testing positive for marijuana are related to rising potency.

She was driven around the local area for 20 minutes, before being found naked in a snow-covered back alley. Initially, police only had the girl's eyewitness account of a \"man in a red car\" identified by her as a Vauxhall Astra, with no other witnesses present. Through careful interview with the girl, it was ascertained from the route she was driven, that the offender had a good knowledge of the local area.\n\n"

Exposure to light or darkness at inappropriate times can also disrupt the circadian cycle, such as exposure to bright light at night or lack of exposure to natural light during the day. Uncommon travel schedules, particularly across different time zones, can also affect the circadian cycle. This is commonly referred to as jet lag, where the body's internal clock is not synchronized with the new time zone. Unhealthy lifestyle practices can also disrupt the circadian rhythm, such as excessive exposure to blue light from electronic devices before bedtime or sacrificing sleep for work or other activities. These disruptions can lead to circadian rhythm sleep disorders, which can manifest as delayed or advanced sleep phases, shift work disorder, or non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms of circadian rhythm sleep disorders can include daytime drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, problems staying asleep, headaches, cognitive impairment, and sometimes even depression. It is important to address and treat circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as they can increase the risk of chronic physical health issues such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart diseases.

Using mice, the scientists show that repeated jet lag increases both obesity related liver disease and the risk of liver cancer. \"We knew we needed an animal model to examine this connection, and studies in the Fu Lab found that chronically jet-lagged mice developed liver cancer in a very similar way as that described for obese humans.\" When we are exposed to light, our bodies' central circadian clock in the brain resets. When we constantly travel through different time zones, work night shifts, or push ourselves to stay awake at the regular sleep time, our central clock is being chronically disrupted. The Baylor College of Medicine scientists didn't directly study jetlag in humans. But there is evidence that sleep disruption increases both fatty liver disease and liver cancer risk in humans, and they hypothesize that lifestyle changes that generate chronic jet lag can also disrupt the body's internal homeostasis and increase liver cancer risk in humans. \"Recent studies have shown that more than 80 percent of the population in the United States adopt a lifestyle that leads to chronic disruption in their sleep schedules,\" says Loning Fu.

It appears more useful than empagliflozin. In the European Union it is indicated in adults: for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise: as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance; in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In November 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that dapagliflozin should no longer be used to treat type 1 diabetes. Rarely, use of an SGLT2 drug, including dapagliflozin, is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene. There are concerns it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n"

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. They found patients taking high potency statins had a 34 per cent higher risk of being hospitalised for acute kidney injury, compared with those taking low doses. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. Rates were not significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’.

In the 1930s, Dr. Weston Price successfully used cod liver oil along with other nutrients to cure tooth decay (here); and modern research has time after time emphasized the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on brain health, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, cancer, as well as maternal and child health. EPA and DHA are two types of Omega-3s that are mainly found in fish oil. On the other hand, ALA (alpha-linoleic acid) is a plant-based omega-3 that is primarily found in chia seeds, flaxseed and hemp. Although our body has the ability to convert ALA into both, this is only done in very small amounts, rendering fish oil supplementation a must. Researchers at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience found that fish oil supplements improve attention, hyperactivity, as well as other behavioral and cognitive symptoms in children with ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (2). They also found that children and adolescents with ADHD had lower blood levels of omega-3 compared to their healthy counterparts. Fish oil is found to be equally important to pregnant and lactating women. A report that combined results from several studies concluded that supplementing pregnant women and newborns with omega-3s were found to raise children's IQ by 3.5 points (3). Omega-3s were also proven beneficial for Alzheimer's disease patients who witnessed an increased blood flow in specific areas of their brains after supplementing fish oil.

They advise to limit saturated fats to <10% of total energy intake, with limited intake of trans-fatty acids; dietary fiber of 30–45 g/day; 200 g of fruits and vegetables each per day; two servings of oily fish per week; and to limit salt intake to <5 g/day. It has high intake of olive oil, vegetables, fruits, cereals, and nuts; moderate intake of poultry, fish, and wine; and a low intake of sweets, red and processed meats, and dairy products. Another factor to consider while prescribing a diet for stroke patients is their comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.\n\n"

For example, some cyanobacteria can produce alkaloid neuromuscular toxins, which can lead to muscular tremors, stupor, prostration, convulsions, and even death. It is important to be aware of the potential effects of algae poisoning on animals and take necessary precautions to prevent their exposure. Cyanobacteria poisoning, also known as blue-green algae poisoning, refers to the toxic effects caused by the ingestion or inhalation of cyanobacteria, particularly from contaminated water sources. Symptoms of cyanobacteria poisoning can vary depending on the specific toxins produced and the amount ingested.

Watermelons may relax blood vessels, improving circulation and even improving libido and erectile function, according to Medical News Today. Watermelon gives you a sweet treat with nutrients that benefit your body. Watermelon's citrulline converts into arginine, an amino acid that benefits the heart and circulatory system. Watermelon and fresh watermelon juice contain more lycopene and beta carotene than tomatoes and tomato juice do. Dark red watermelons are particularly rich in these protective phytonutrients. A 1/2 cup of diced watermelon contains only 25 calories and 6 grams of carbs, with no fat and no sodium, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A total of 14 dogs were also exposed. Health officials continue to educate the public about preventing rabies exposure. \"Rabies can infect any mammal,\" said Mark E. Wallace, MD, MPH, executive director of the Weld County Health Department. In past years, domestic bison and horses have contracted rabies, in addition to a variety of wildlife. \"The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated.

If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance.

In Canada, common carriers of rabies are bats, raccoon, skunk and foxes. Recently the most human-rabies cases have been contracted by rabies in bats. There are several strains presently in Ontario, there are skunk and fox strains, raccoon strains and bats have several strains. If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance. As a precaution, all bites or scratches by raccoons should be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Raccoons may incubate rabies for long\n\n"

The annual growth of health expenditures between 2015 and 2025 will be 1.3 percentage points faster than growth in gross domestic product, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said in a report published in the independent journal, Health Affairs. Health spending rose 2.9 percent in 2013, according to the study, but rose 5.3 percent in 2014 and is expected to have risen 5.5 percent in 2015 largely as a result of millions of Americans gaining insurance coverage in 2014 under the federal Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

About 8 percent of Americans are expected to be uninsured in 2025, down from about 11 percent in 2014, CMS auditors said in the report. Total health expenditures this year are expected to reach $3.2 trillion, rising to $5.6 trillion in 2025.

A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Rofecoxib was approved in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. In 2005 the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious CV events than non-selective NSAIDs.

Epidemiologists at the Florida Department of Health announced Monday that an unidentified child tested positive for influenza B and died between Sept. 30 and Oct. 6. This marks the first influenza-associated pediatric death in Florida during the 2018–19 season, according to a report. The state has also reported two outbreaks — one of an influenza-like illness and the other influenza and group A Streptococcus, which are bacteria that cause strep throat — at schools and camps serving children. Last winter, the US experienced a particularly severe and deadly flu season. An estimated 80,000 people died from flu and its complications, which was the highest number reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 40 years. Of those deaths during the 2017–18 flu season, 180 were children. Children, especially those who are under the age of 5 or live with a chronic health problem, have a higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, according to the CDC. These include dehydration, pneumonia, sinus infections, and brain dysfunction — in rare cases, these complications can be life-threatening. However, the flu can be dangerous and deadly for anyone, even healthy adults. There are several different types of flu shots available this year — talk to your doctor to find out which one you need. During the 2017–18 flu season, vaccination coverage among children in the US was low; only about 57.9% of children between 6 months and 17 years received the flu shot, according to the CDC. But among the 180 children who died, approximately 80% were unvaccinated. A pregnant woman in the South Bay area died from flu-related illness, along with her unborn baby, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced Thursday. A total of 52 people in the county have died from the flu during the current flu season, officials said. “This sad event demonstrates that serious complications can occur with flu infection in pregnant women,” said Jonathan Fielding, director of the county Public Health Department. “Therefore, it is critical that all pregnant and postpartum women get vaccinated to protect themselves against the flu. The CDC has known for weeks that the dominant flu strain this season is the H1N1 virus, which first emerged in April 2009 and caused a pandemic. It’s included in all flu shots and nasal vaccines this year, according to the CDC report. Fifty pediatric flu-related deaths have been reported during the current flu season, according to the CDC report. Adult flu deaths are not reported on a national basis, but the CDC estimates that between 3,000 and 49,000 people die each year because of the flu and flu-related illness.

The outbreak was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and a pandemic on March 11. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. This outbreak has since caused a health issue in the city of Wuhan, China which evolved into a global pandemic. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, \n\n Chaos and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have made a catastrophic future seem less remote and action to prevent it more necessary.\n\n"

The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home from a trip to Europe. Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. February 2020 On 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated\n\n"

However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.

A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed.

Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are \"a common phenomena in Asia\". In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females.

Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. Some evidence indicates A. americanum saliva inactivates B. burgdorferi more quickly than the saliva of Ixodes scapularis. Recently the bacteria Borrelia andersonii and Borrelia americana have been linked to A. americanum. However, it is quite easy to be unaware of small insect-like pests that can cause serious systemic illness. One example is the friendly tick that harbors the germ causing Lyme Disease. It is also known as the Great Imitator because it is often mistaken for other illnesses such as mononucleosis, strep throat, the flu, meningitis, tension headache, ringworm, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, and others. Several species of tick (Ixodes), which primarily feed on deer, squirrels and small rodents, carry the spirochete known as Borrelia burgdorferi. Human infection primarily occurs by a tick bite directly transmitting the bacteria through the skin. For the later, more advanced stages of disease (such as meningitis, heart involvement, or arthritis),\n\nPlague is only one of the several diseases classified as zoonoses – diseases that can be transferred between animals and humans. Some forms of zoonoses in humans are caused by direct contact with an animal, while other forms are caused by indirect contact with an animal through agents such as the flea, the fly, or the tick. Like plague, Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are spread to humans indirectly from an animal through the bite of a tick that attaches itself to a person during out-door activity. Sometimes no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence, the tick that transmits Lyme disease usually lives on white-tailed deer, field mice, and other wild animals whose bodies contain bacteria. If not treated, Lyme disease can affect the central nervous system and cause skin complications and symptoms of arthritis. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, transmitted primarily by the American dog tick, causes symptoms similar to those of Lyme disease – headache, fever, and skin rash. Also, as with Lyme disease, early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics prevent more serious complications. To lessen the chance of tick-borne disease, it’s wise to take precautions when you’re outdoors in parks, fields, or woods. If a tick attaches itself to your skin, use tweezers to gently remove it. Another disease associated with outdoor activity is tularemia, or rabbit fever. This disease spreads from infected animals, usually wild rabbits, to humans by the direct contact with the animal or through the bite of ticks and flies. Since the disease is transmitted primarily by direct contact with the tissue of an infected animal, hunters should wear rubber gloves when cleaning game, and all game should be thoroughly cooked. These forms of zoonoses are associated with the outdoors, but much closer to home – even in your own living room – danger may lurk. What harm could your striped tabby possibly present?

Tracking the teenagers for three years, the team found that those in Group 4 were on average seven times more likely than those in Group 1, and two to three times more likely than in\n\n Towards a Psychosis Risk Blood Diagnostic for Persons Experiencing High-Risk Symptoms: In this study, the researchers looked at different analytes found in human blood plasma. These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis. But during the pruning process of adolescence, if a child is subject to high stress \n\n Foster children have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in comparison to children raised by their biological parents. Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system. Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences. “Low levels of the stress hormone cortisol marks out children at higher risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome as adults,” reported the BBC today. It said that if children with low levels of cortisol are exposed to trauma such as sexual abuse, they are six times more likely to develop the condition when older. Contrary to the impression that might be gained from parts of the news report, this study did not assess cortisol levels in childhood, but only in adults with or without CFS. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Archives of General Psychiatry . The researchers wanted to investigate this by looking at levels of the hormone cortisol in people with and without CFS. Cortisol is involved in the body’s stress response. Of these people, 124 were confirmed as healthy, and acted as controls.\n\n"

We spoke with Sattva Neelapu, M.D., to learn more. Doctors extract T cells (a type of white blood cell) from the patient’s blood and then add an artificial receptor (called a “chimeric antigen receptor”) to their surface. CAR T-cell therapy can cause some unusual side effects. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. It’s also known as a “cytokine storm.” About 70-90% of patients experience it, but it’s very short-term and only lasts about five to seven days. It usually starts around the second or third day after the infusion. There’s a very effective remedy for CRS now called tocilizumab, which reverses this side effect fairly quickly. The medicine was originally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but has since been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CRS. The other side effect is known as “CRES,” which stands for “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome.” It typically starts around day five after the infusion. Patients eventually recover all of their neurological functions. Which types of cancer can CAR T-cell therapy treat currently? We have different FDA-approved cell therapy products for each of these cancers, thanks to clinical trials. Indolent B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a personalized cellular therapy treatment for leukemia developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The first-of-its-kind therapy treats cancer by altering a patient's own cells to fight cancer. If you have questions or think you might be a candidate, please discuss with your physician.

In particular, researchers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center have identified the effect of T cells, which are responsible for the identification and destruction of abnormal substances, like cancer.

The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.

Ipilimumab is just one example of a medicine that works in this way. T-cells are taken out of your body, genetically programmed to better recognize and kill tumor cells, and then re-introduced as the living therapy. As researchers have learned more about what makes cancer cells different from normal cells, they have developed mAbs to exploit these differences.

Hepatitis A cases have continued to rise within the County, climbing to 20 so far in 2019 - surpassing the annual totals for 4 of the past 5 years. The Health Department urges all people at risk, especially people experiencing homelessness and those who are using (or trying to quit using) illicit drugs to get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Since November 1, 2018, the date disease investigators believe the outbreak began, there have been 34 cases linked to the outbreak. The County has been working with community partners to conduct vaccination clinics for people who are at risk for hepatitis A infection. Over the course of this outbreak, vaccination teams have been going into facilities to vaccinate as many people in the high-risk groups as possible. For more information about hepatitis A infection and where to get the HAV vaccine, visit www.pima.gov/hep-a or call (520) 724-7797. Beginning in November 2016, San Diego had one of the nation's largest Hepatitis A epidemics. From 2016 to 2018, Hepatitis A caused at least twenty deaths in San Diego County, with 589 reported cases of infection. On October 24, 2018, the Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all persons aged 1 year and older experiencing homelessness be routinely immunized against HAV. An October 2017 news article on the San Diego epidemic noted that, in the summer of 2016, as part of preparations for the MLB \n\n Game, \"the city was locking and removing bathrooms,\" contributing to what one infectious disease researcher described as \"the perfect storm.\" Faulconer and his staff learned of the Hepatitis A outbreak in June 2017 and proposed plans to combat it, including installing hand washing stations near homeless encampments. However, San Diego County Public Health officials experienced delays and attributed these to \"an inability to swiftly coordinate with city officials.\" In an interview about the causes of San Diego's rapidly escalating Hepatitis A epidemic and the high rates of death, it was noted that \"When those emergency tents [for PEH] were permanently closed, we began to see a dramatic increase in the number of people living on the streets.\" St Lucie County, FL – The flu season is now underway. As a precaution health officials with the Florida Department of Health in St. Lucie urge residents and visitors to take precautions to limit their risk of exposure to seasonal flu, an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza virus.

For more information about hepatitis A infection and where to get the HAV vaccine, visit www.pima.gov/hep-a or call (520) 724-7797. Beginning in November 2016, San Diego had one of the nation's largest Hepatitis A epidemics. From 2016 to 2018, Hepatitis A caused at least twenty deaths in San Diego County, with 589 reported cases of infection. On October 24, 2018, the Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all persons aged 1 year and older experiencing homelessness be routinely immunized against HAV. An October 2017 news article on the San Diego epidemic noted that, in the summer of 2016, as part of preparations for the MLB \n\n Game, \"the city was locking and removing bathrooms,\" contributing to what one infectious disease researcher described as \"the perfect storm.\" Faulconer and his staff learned of the Hepatitis A outbreak in June 2017 and proposed plans to combat it, including installing hand washing stations near homeless encampments. However, San Diego County Public Health officials experienced delays and attributed these to \"an inability to swiftly coordinate with city officials.\" In an interview about the causes of San Diego's rapidly escalating Hepatitis A epidemic and the high rates of death, it was noted that \"When those emergency tents [for PEH] were permanently closed, we began to see a dramatic increase in the number of people living on the streets.\" St Lucie County, FL – The flu season is now underway. As a precaution health officials with the Florida Department of Health in St. Lucie urge residents and visitors to take precautions to limit their risk of exposure to seasonal flu, an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza virus. Get re-vaccinated EVERY FLU SEASON because strains of flu viruses change each year. You may benefit from treatment with prescription antiviral medication. For more information about the Florida Department of Health in St. Lucie County please visit www.stluciecountyhealth.com. The Florida Department of Health in Collier County will offer free flu vaccines Saturday in East Naples and Immokalee. \"With flu cases continuing to rise, I urge all families to get vaccinated against influenza,” said Stephanie Vick, administrator for the Florida Department of Health in Collier County. The vaccines will be offered from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 3339 U.S. 41 in East Naples and from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 419 North First St. in Immokalee.

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence. Treatments include monoclonal antibodies, novel antiviral drugs, and symptom control. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. Etymology The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the \"coronavirus pandemic\", despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".

The first number of cases was detected in Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak. Proper identification of a novel coronavirus was developed and reported, making the pneumonia cases in China the first reported cases of COVID-19. Results from patient samples obtained on 29–30 December indicated the presence of a novel coronavirus, related to SARS. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first \n\n On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.\n\n"

The purpose of these injections is to supplement the lubricating properties of the synovial fluid in the joints, which helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. The injection involves the introduction of gel-like substances, called hyaluronates, into the affected joint. By increasing synovial fluid levels of HA, viscosupplementation injections have been effective in reducing pain by decreasing levels of inflammatory substances called prostaglandins. It is important to note that not all patients with osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation injections. Significant improvement in pain has been observed in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis. However, patients with advanced destructive osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain may not experience the same level of benefits. Please consult with a healthcare professional to determine whether viscosupplementation injections are a suitable option for your specific condition. Viscosupplementation is a medical procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee or other joints in patients whose pain has failed to respond to conservative approaches. Brand names of viscosupplementation solutions include Hylagan, Orthovisc, Supartz, and Synvisc – all of which we use at Unique Pain Medicine. A pre-filled syringe of viscosupplementation is then injected into the joint to help loosen the knee and reduce friction thereby decreasing pain, minimizing inflammation, and improving motion.

For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. See this viscosupplementation injection video which displays the technique of injection with viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of right elbow joint.

Since most women have mammograms, this may be any easy and inexpensive way to see who may be at a higher risk for having a heart attack. Routine mammography screening could be a useful tool for identifying women at risk for heart disease by analyzing levels of breast calcification, according to a study to be presented at the upcoming American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.

They also suggest mammograms every other year rather than yearly from 50-74. They are trying to reduce false positive mammograms, at a cost of missing curable cancers.

As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of ionizing radiation to create images. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends (2016) mammography every two years between the ages of 50 and 74, concluding that \"the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s\". The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be performed with increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reduction. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded after ten years that trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer. She has been a vocal critic of the current United States Preventive Services Task Force guideline that now classifies mammograms as optional for women between 40 and 49 years of age. According to Julie Margenthaler, a breast surgeon with the Washington University School of Medicine and Chair of the ASBrS Communication Committee, the controversy appears to be a result of conflicting data from studies, as well as a focus on incidence rates, possibly without placing equal value on the stage of a patient's cancer when first diagnosed.

So far more than 5,500 uninsured New York residents and approximately 2,500 uninsured New Jersey residents have used the program to replace lost or damaged prescription medication and medical equipment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has provided $8.2 million in crisis counseling grants to support disaster behavioral health needs in New York. With these funds, the state plans to hire and train 1,000 workers in 35 service provider organizations. First introduced in the House by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), PAHPA had broad implications for the United States Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS) preparedness and response activities. Among other things, the act amended the Public Health Service Act to establish within the department a new Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR); provided new authorities for a number of programs, including the advanced development and acquisitions of medical countermeasures; and called for the establishment of a quadrennial National Health Security Strategy. After it lapsed, an amended version, the Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act, was signed into law on June 2019. Major program areas Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and Medical Countermeasures Emergency Support Function (ESF) #8: Public Health and Medical Response: Domestic Programs Emergency Support Function (ESF) #8: Public Health and Medical Response: International Programs Grants At-Risk Individuals National Health Security Strategy (NHSS) Situational Awareness: Surveillance, Credentialing, and Telehealth Education and Training Provisions Title I: National Preparedness and Response, Leadership, Organization, and Planning Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead all federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan. Title II: Public Health Security Preparedness Expands the program for state and local public health emergency preparedness to allow political subdivisions of states or a consortium of states to be eligible for funding.

The 1918 flu pandemic (January 1918 – December 1920) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic, the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus. It infected 500 million people across the world, including remote Pacific islands and the Arctic, and killed 50 to 100 million of them—three to five percent of the world's population —making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.

The earliest documented case was March 1918 in Kansas, United States, with further cases recorded in France, Germany and the United Kingdom in April. Estimates of deaths range from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The pandemic broke out near the end of World War I, when wartime censors suppressed bad news in the belligerent countries to maintain morale, but newspapers freely reported the outbreak in neutral Spain, creating a false impression of Spain as the epicenter.

Congress has stepped up efforts to improve the federal government’s response to the rapidly growing epidemic of Lyme disease. The FY 2018 Congressional Appropriations bill signed into law on March 23, 2018 was accompanied by House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports that include more than a dozen directives for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve their programs for surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease. These directives also require CDC and NIH to submit detailed reports to help Congress gauge program effectiveness and determine future funding levels. In addition, CDC has been directed to establish performance indicators for Lyme disease and to justify funding disparities between Lyme disease and other less common vector-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus and Zika. Since Lyme disease was identified in 1975 by Dr. Allen Steere when he was investigating a cluster of cases of rheumatoid arthritis in children in Lyme, Connecticut, it has become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with 380,690 new cases in 2015 alone at a cost of more than $4.2 billion. Lyme disease has been reported in all 50 U.S. states, and the number of high-risk counties has increased 320% over the past two decades.

Formidable obstacles have hampered the federal government’s response to the Lyme epidemic. Compounding these problems is inadequate federal funding for prevention and research. While CDC and NIH consider Lyme a priority vector-borne disease, they don’t give it the same attention and resources as other priority vector-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus and Zika, which are far less common with a dramatically lower burden of disease. For example, NIH’s FY 2015 Lyme disease program funding was $24 million, or $63 per case. By contrast, funding for West Nile virus with 2,062 cases in 2015 was $40 million, or $19,627 per case.

What Are the Risks Associated With Heart Transplants? More than 2,000 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Each year thousands more would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available. People who have advanced (end stage) heart failure, but are otherwise healthy, may be considered for a heart transplant. Can you adhere to the lifestyle changes, including complex drug treatments and frequent exams, required after a transplant? If you answered 'no' to any of the above questions, a heart transplant may not be for you. Also, if you have additional medical problems, such as other severe diseases, active infections, or severe obesity, you most likely will not be considered a candidate for transplant. In order to get a heart transplant, you must first be placed on a transplant list. But, before you can be placed on the transplant list, you must go through a careful screening process. A team of heart doctors, nurses, social workers, and bioethicists review your medical history, diagnostic test results, social history, and psychological test results to see if you are able to survive the procedure and then comply with the continuous care needed to live a long, healthy life. Donors for heart transplants are individuals who may have recently died or become brain dead, which means that although their body is being kept alive by machines, the brain has no sign of life. Many times, these donors died as a result of a car accident, severe head injury, or a gunshot wound. Donor organs are located through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computerized national waiting list. This waiting list assures equal access and fair distribution of organs when they become available. The race and gender of the donor have no bearing on the match.

Moreover, it would be beneficial to explore and examine how utilization of mental health services is affected by the stigma that persists among veterans. Additional awareness of medical resources available to veterans can help to erase the stigma of seeking mental health treatment. The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a \"seamless transition\" to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan. The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development's research into developing better-functioning prosthetic limbs, and treatment of PTSD are also heralded. The VHA has also adopted Boston University's Project RED program, designed to improve the discharge process for veterans in hopes that, by educating patients, the VHA will experience a reduced number of readmission among veterans and provide more information on telerehabilitation. Veteran Affairs utilization rates among Iraqi and Afghanistan-war veterans in the mid-Atlantic region with PTSD diagnosis between 2002–2008 were tracked using ICD-9 codes of those newly diagnosed.

The grant, the largest single donation to Rush since its founding in 1837, will expand a Wounded Warrior Project-funded program that provides three weeks of concentrated post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, an approach that has been proven to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, symptoms. The Road Home Program was launched in 2014 to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, regardless of the ability to pay. As part of that effort, Wounded Warrior Project provided a $15 million grant for Rush to help support its treatment programs, including the development of a three-week Intensive Outpatient Program.

Moreover, it would be beneficial to explore and examine how utilization of mental health services is affected by the stigma that persists among veterans. Additional awareness of medical resources available to veterans can help to erase the stigma of seeking mental health treatment. The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a \"seamless transition\" to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan. The Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development's research into developing better-functioning prosthetic limbs, and treatment of PTSD are also heralded. The VHA has also adopted Boston University's Project RED program, designed to improve the discharge process for veterans in hopes that, by educating patients, the VHA will experience a reduced number of readmission among veterans and provide more information on telerehabilitation. Veteran Affairs utilization rates among Iraqi and Afghanistan-war veterans in the mid-Atlantic region with PTSD diagnosis between 2002–2008 were tracked using ICD-9 codes of those newly diagnosed. Limitations to this study included: type of treatment intervention was not delineated; only looked at PTSD treatment over a short period of time (180 days).

The grant, the largest single donation to Rush since its founding in 1837, will expand a Wounded Warrior Project-funded program that provides three weeks of concentrated post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, an approach that has been proven to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, symptoms. The Road Home Program was launched in 2014 to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, regardless of the ability to pay. As part of that effort, Wounded Warrior Project provided a $15 million grant for Rush to help support its treatment programs, including the development of a three-week Intensive Outpatient Program.

This is not a simple, predictable condition, like high cholesterol or diabetes. Some patients may only need a few doses, which makes it especially hard to predict the market. For example, Pfizer, whose drug is called crizotinib, is collaborating on a trial with Merck and pembrolizumab to treat one form of lung cancer. The FDA has approved such treatments from Merck & Co <MRK.N>, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co <BMY.N> and Roche Holding AG <ROG.S>, each of which have list prices of $150,000 per year. At least five other drugmakers are developing similar medicines. \"As with everything in drug development, it is about reduction of risk,\" he said.

For those alive after two years, there was no evidence that the Opdivo benefit had begun to wane, Bristol-Myers said. \"There's a very clear difference between Opdivo and the old standard of care, which is chemotherapy.\"\n\n"

Studies have shown that bisphosphonate medications like Bondronat may increase the risk of atypical femur fractures and a disfiguring jaw injury known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Bondronat Bone Fracture Update 5/24/12: In a study published this week by the Archives of Internal Medicine, Swiss researchers reached conclusions similar to those reached earlier this month by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) – that taking osteoporosis drugs from the bisphosphonate class can increase the risk of atypical bone fractures. Taken cumulatively, the results of the study seem to suggest that the risk of fractures increased over time while the benefits of the drugs decreased. Osteoporosis is a chronic debilitating disease that affects approximately 45 million people nationwide, typically affecting post-menopausal women by decreasing the density and strength of bones. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to severe fractures of the spine, hip and thigh. As the population of our nation continues to age, so too will the number of people suffering from the effects of osteoporosis continue to increase. Drugs from the bisphosphonate class are designed to bind tightly to tissue, thereby preventing calcium from being removed and sustaining bone density.

Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids.

In 2017, this pipeline was reported to have leaked 210,000 gallons of oil on the land, potentially affecting wildlife and water sources.\n\n"

However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. If medical treatment is not effective, surgery may need to be performed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. There are two types of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the standard monopolar and the newer bipolar procedure. A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies that included 8924 men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably results in comparable improvements urinary symptoms, as well as a similar erectile function, the incidence of urinary incontinence and the need for retreatment. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects.

It was last used in 1944. In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. Previous studies by a research group at the University of Geneva demonstrated a role for glucocorticoids in shifting the biological clock, and characterized this effect in the liver. For example, at some point in the time zone transition, your brain might be in the time zone of Sydney, Australia; your heart in Hawaii; and your liver still in Los Angeles. It is important to note that approximately 16 percent of the U.S. and European workforces undertake some form of shift work. However, a new study on how the time of day affects autoimmune symptoms could offer new ways of treating this complex and increasingly common group of diseases. According to new research, there may be ties to the body’s internal clocks that have a huge impact on severity of both symptoms and the disease itself. Our immune system bases its activity partially on our internal clocks, so it is no surprise that autoimmune diseases do so as well. According to a new study, this timing may be more important in autoimmune disease than we previously believed. Could Molecular Clocks Contribute to Autoimmune Disease? This is not the first study to find that internal clocks are linked to both risk and severity of autoimmune disease. In fact, there is a new field called chronoimmunology dedicated to the study of how immune systems affect and are affected by timing and clocks. Previous studies have found that young adults who work odd shifts, for example, have a higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease later in life. However, while what we eat is important, a growing body of research suggests when we eat matters too. While you have likely heard of the circadian rhythm, the master \"clock\" in the brain that governs our sleep-wake cycle, we actually have a variety of circadian clocks that govern the daily cycle of activity for every organ. These rhythms exist because every organ needs downtime for repair and regeneration. Even our gut microbiome operates on a daily rhythm. Circadian clocks optimize our health by aligning our biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns. Disrupting our circadian clocks — such as by skipping breakfast or eating at midnight — can result in health issues such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and more. About 20 to 30 percent of American adults skip breakfast. Some do it to save time, many do it in an effort to lose weight. However, studies show that people who eat breakfast daily are less likely to be obese, malnourished, suffer from impaired blood sugar metabolism, or be diagnosed with diabetes. They are also less likely to have the heart disease risk factors of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Even the American Heart Association recently endorsed biologically appropriate meal timing to reduce the risk of heart disease. Just eating breakfast isn't the only important thing however. The timing in relation to the size of our meals is also important. This is partially because insulin, a hormone that helps with blood sugar control, appears to be most efficient in the morning. In addition, we burn more calories and digest food more efficiently in the morning than later in the day when most of us eat our largest meal. Half consumed 700 calories at breakfast, 500 calories at lunch, and 200 calories at supper, and the other half reversed that pattern. This study was performed at the University of Sydney’s NHMRC Centre for Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep or CIRUS. Dr. Craig Philips also added that though the results need to be confirmed through much bigger study. He also said that there might be an influence in the body clock in this issue as it has the tendency or the urge to push the blood fat levels during these times in the wee hours of midnight.

Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate.

Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines.

The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) .

On July 31, 2012, she became the first person in Texas history to defeat an incumbent Republican senator, Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio, in a primary election. Her district serves all of Comal County, a small portion of Guadalupe County, a large portion of Hays County, all of Kendall County, and portions of northern Bexar and southern Travis counties. Early life and education Campbell was born on the naval base in San Diego, California, and reared in Oklahoma. Campbell obtained her undergraduate degree in nursing from Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma. from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock in May 1989 and completed an internship in general surgery at Methodist Hospital in Dallas from 1989–1990.

        "context": " Democratic U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke lost his Senate bid to the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz by about 200,000 votes, a significant gain for Democrats in the state. O'Rourke's performance in the 2018 Senate race has shaken the notion of Republican dominance in Texas, with analysts predicting greater gains for the Democrats going into the 2020s. Doggett was set to face State Representative Joaquin Castro in the 35th district primary election. The race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro seen as a \"rising star\" \n\nDonna Sue Burrows Campbell (born September 9, 1954) is a politician and physician who is the 25th District member of the Texas Senate. On July 31, 2012, she became the first person in Texas history to defeat an incumbent Republican senator, Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio, in a primary election. Her district serves all of Comal County, a small portion of Guadalupe County, a large portion of Hays County, all of Kendall County, and portions of northern Bexar and southern Travis counties. Early life and education Campbell was born on the naval base in San Diego, California, and reared in Oklahoma. Campbell obtained her undergraduate degree in nursing from Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma. from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock in May 1989 and completed an internship in general surgery at Methodist Hospital in Dallas from 1989–1990. Campbell has volunteered her time and expertise to perform hundreds of eye surgeries in Ghana, West Africa, working through the Christian Eye Ministry, an organization which focuses its efforts to bring back sight to people living in Africa. Tenure On her first day in the legislature, an aide to Senator John Whitmire passed out and Campbell provided assistance. Texas Governor Rick Perry and Campbell support a proposed 2013 law, one that would restrict abortions after the twentieth week of pregnancy, place abortion clinics in the same regulatory category as other ambulatory surgery centers, and require doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within thirty miles of the facility where they perform abortions.

Key facts HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, with a budget of more than $2.1 billion (FY 2008), funds primary health care, support services and life-sustaining medications for about half of the estimated 1.1 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 directs that more funds be spent on \"core services\" (medical, dental and prescription assistance), rather than such support functions as housing and transportation.

First funded in FY 1996 at $52 million, state-run ADAPs today receive $808.5 million to provide antiretroviral medications to patients who cannot afford them. Almost three-quarters of Ryan White patients are minorities, who have higher rates of HIV infection and are more likely to reside in areas with a shortage of health professionals, screening facilities and treatment centers.

The net proceeds of more than a quarter of a million dollars has funded local HIV related programs and more importantly has funded educational and support programs in China for orphans, pregnant women and alike. Since 2009, the fund built two Children Centers with libraries, computer facilities with full-time staff in administering various activities in Henan, China serving 400 HIV affected children (mostly orphans) in the neighboring villages.

The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) is the fastest growing grant component in Ryan White. First funded in FY 1996 at $52 million, state-run ADAPs today receive $808.5 million to provide antiretroviral medications to patients who cannot afford them. Almost three-quarters of Ryan White patients are minorities, who have higher rates of HIV infection and are more likely to reside in areas with a shortage of health professionals, screening facilities and treatment centers. History The original Ryan White Program was enacted in 1990 to improve the quality and availability of care for people with HIV/AIDS and their families. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides primary medical care—including dentistry—and support services to individuals living with the disease who lack health insurance or personal financial resources to pay for their own care. While clinical care and support services are the primary focus of the program, Ryan White also funds training and technical assistance for medical professionals as well as demonstration projects aimed at identifying and slowing the epidemic in high-risk populations.\n\n"

In 2015, Researchers at New Mexico State University tested 10 commercially available products for their effectiveness at repelling mosquitoes. On the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the vector of Zika virus, only one repellent that did not contain DEET had a strong effect for the duration of the 240 minutes test: a lemon eucalyptus oil repellent.

You can lower your chance of being bitten by an insect or spiderlike animal (arachnid) by using insect repellents. Tick bites can cause serious diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If you have a question or concern about the use of insect repellents, or if you are pregnant or nursing, talk with your doctor. Unless you are in areas with a large number of mosquitoes, repellents with 10% to 24% DEET should keep most mosquitoes away from your skin. Studies over the past 40 years haven't shown that DEET causes cancer or other illnesses. Use it only when there is a high risk of insect bites. Use a repellent with the lowest strength of DEET available (usually 10% to 30%). DEET may damage some synthetic fabrics as well as plastic watch crystals and eyeglass frames.

In the only election debate he attended, where he joined Democrat James Thompson, and the campaign manager for Libertarian candidate Chris Rockhold, he repeated the claim that Planned Parenthood had been profiting by selling parts of aborted fetuses. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research.

It can contaminate hot water tanks, hot tubs, and cooling towers of large air conditioners. It is usually spread by breathing in mist that contains the bacteria. Risk factors for infection include older age, a history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function. No vaccine is available. Prevention depends on good maintenance of water systems. Treatment of Legionnaires' disease is with antibiotics. Recommended agents include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, or doxycycline. Legionnaires' disease is the cause of an estimated 2–9% of pneumonia cases that are acquired outside of a hospital. While it can occur any time of the year, it is more common in the summer and fall. Those with Legionnaires' disease usually have fever, chills, and a cough, which may be dry or may produce sputum.\n\n"

Historically, even Florence Nightingale, the founder of “modern day” nursing advocated for the health benefits derived from animal companionship, and as early as 1860, she observed that small pet animals can help heal the sick. Similarly, in 1961, Dr. Levinson found that the unconditional acceptance and love provided by pets offer a secure and warm environment for children and other patients, increasing their ability to adapt better psychologically to other people. Other studies have demonstrated that using animals as an adjunct in healthcare had the ability to reduce anxiety and depression, decrease loneliness in the elderly, facilitate an inviting environment for a therapeutic interaction to take place and enhanced the relationship between client and counsellor. In this way, we use the term Animal Assisted Therapy and not animal therapy. Animal Assisted Therapy is delivered and/or directed by health & human service provider working within the scope of their profession and is designed to promote improvement in human physical, social, emotional, or cognitive function. Animal Assisted Therapy improves clients’ mental, physical, social and emotional functioning with the aid of animal and can take place in a variety of settings, including client’s homes, disability services and rehabilitation, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, schools and mental health facilities.

In nursing homes and hospitals, pet therapy programs are often implemented through pet therapy days, where animals are brought in to visit with residents and patients. Similarly, in correctional facilities, animals are taken to help reduce destructive behaviors among inmates. The types of animals used in pet therapy programs vary depending on the audience and the environment. While dogs and cats are the most popular choices, other animals like birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, and even fish can also be used for therapy purposes. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects. Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) is a goal-directed intervention in which animals, meeting specific criteria, are an integral part of the treatment process in healthcare settings. It is important to note that AAT is not the same as animal therapy, as the therapy is delivered and/or directed by health and human service providers working within the scope of their profession. AAT aims to promote improvement in human physical, social, emotional, or cognitive function by utilizing animals as a tool in the therapeutic process. The presence of animals during therapy can have various benefits for individuals in healthcare settings. Some of the benefits of Animal Assisted Therapy include:\n\n1. The unconditional acceptance and love provided by animals create a secure and warm environment where patients can feel emotionally supported. Enhancing therapeutic relationships: Animals can serve as a bridge between clients and healthcare providers, facilitating a more inviting and comfortable environment for therapeutic interactions. Supporting physical rehabilitation: Animal Assisted Therapy can be beneficial in physical rehabilitation settings. Animal Assisted Therapy can be conducted in various healthcare settings, such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and mental health facilities. Overall, Animal Assisted Therapy harnesses the therapeutic potential of animals to enhance the mental, physical, social, and emotional functioning of individuals in healthcare settings. Animals in various settings have been found to provide therapeutic benefits and can greatly improve the well-being of individuals. Additionally, animals are used in correctional facilities where a decline in destructive behaviors has been observed in many cases. Various animals can be used in pet therapy programs depending on the audience and the environment. Many nursing homes and hospitals now have pet therapy days where animals are brought in to visit with residents and patients.

        "context": "Anecdotally, we all seem to know that somehow, animals can be therapeutic – and, we have the ability to form bonds with them. Historically, even Florence Nightingale, the founder of “modern day” nursing advocated for the health benefits derived from animal companionship, and as early as 1860, she observed that small pet animals can help heal the sick. Similarly, in 1961, Dr. Levinson found that the unconditional acceptance and love provided by pets offer a secure and warm environment for children and other patients, increasing their ability to adapt better psychologically to other people. Other studies have demonstrated that using animals as an adjunct in healthcare had the ability to reduce anxiety and depression, decrease loneliness in the elderly, facilitate an inviting environment for a therapeutic interaction to take place and enhanced the relationship between client and counsellor. In this way, we use the term Animal Assisted Therapy and not animal therapy. Animal Assisted Therapy is delivered and/or directed by health & human service provider working within the scope of their profession and is designed to promote improvement in human physical, social, emotional, or cognitive function. Animal Assisted Therapy improves clients’ mental, physical, social and emotional functioning with the aid of animal and can take place in a variety of settings, including client’s homes, disability services and rehabilitation, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, schools and mental health facilities.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant found in many over-the-counter cold and flu medications, including cough syrups. Unfortunately, dextromethorphan has been shown to be habit-forming and intoxicating. It is now a drug of abuse that can even cause a life-threatening overdose when a person consumes too much. Nonmedical abuse of DXM can lead to experiences that are reportedly similar to those caused by PCP or ketamine. Although dextromethorphan alone can cause intoxication, other drugs often found in cold or flu medicines can enhance the ingredient’s effects. These include analgesics like acetaminophen, antihistamines, and decongestants like pseudoephedrine. Long-term abuse of dextromethorphan-based drugs often leads to dependence, tolerance, and addiction. Taking DXM-containing drugs for nonmedical reasons has become extremely popular among adolescents in the US. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists different dose-dependent plateaus, as experienced by people who abuse DXM. Intoxication from a nonmedical dose begins between 15 and 30 minutes after ingestion, as the stomach digests the drug, and the effects typically last for 3-6 hours. This is 5-10 times the recommended dose of any over-the-counter medicine containing DXM. If a person displays either, or both, of these symptoms, they may be experiencing an overdose. Dangerous physical symptoms of dextromethorphan overdose include tachycardia, slow breathing, changes in blood pressure and body temperature, and seizures. If a person is overdosing on DXM, they require emergency medical attention. Deliriants in particular appear to be noted for their powerful effects on users’ behavior. Some antihistamines may also act as deliriants in high doses. Dextromethorphan (DXM) is a cough suppressant drug that is found in cough and cold medications, including Vicks, Coricidin and Robitussin. Originally developed to replace codeine phosphate, this cough suppressant was approved by the FDA in the year 1958, and has been used as an over-the-counter antitussive ever since. When taken in high enough doses, DXM has been known to cause hallucinogenic effects similar to those caused by PCP and Ketamine. Cough medicine is the main way in which DXM users administer the drug, and although the taste is typically as awful as you would imagine it to be, the effect the drug has had on easing the pain of opiate withdrawal, has been overall positive.

Fourteen rural Oregon counties with a publicly insured (Medicaid) population of 82,000 children (0 to 21 years old) and pregnant women served by a managed dental care organization are randomized into test and control counties. In the control intervention, care is delivered in dental offices without performance incentives. The primary outcome is the prevalence of untreated dental caries. Data are collected through patient and staff surveys, clinical examinations, and the review of health and administrative records. If effective, PREDICT is expected to substantially reduce disparities in dental care and oral health. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Advantage Dental Services, LLC, are supporting the evaluation. Dental caries (tooth decay) predominantly afflict low-income children who also receive fewer dental services . Approximately 45 % of children 3 to 5 years old and fewer than 10 % of children younger than 2 years old received dental services in 2008 in the United States . Many children have their first dental visit in the Emergency Department, and surgical in-hospital treatment of dental caries is becoming more common and costly. Indeed, preventable dental conditions were the primary reason for 830,590 ED visits by Americans in 2009, a 16 % increase from 2006 . This is because early oral examination aids in the detection of the early stages of tooth decay. Early detection is essential to maintain oral health, modify aberrant habits, and treat as needed and as simply as possible. Additionally, parents are given a program of preventive home care (brushing, flossing and fluorides), a caries risk assessment, information on finger, thumb, and pacifier habits, and may include advice on preventing injuries to the mouth and teeth of children, diet counseling, and information on growth and development. Oregon Health & Science University is where healing, teaching and discovery come together. OHSU is also Portland's largest employer and a statewide economic powerhouse. Our operations include three campuses, adult and children’s hospitals, and clinics across Oregon. Learn more below and in the OHSU Fact Book. Patients who were admitted or transferred to an observation unit are counted in those categories. OHSU has provided care for uninsured and otherwise underserved people for more than 130 years. We provide more than 200 community health programs in rural and urban areas throughout Oregon. The Center for Health & Healing, completed in 2006, was the nation's first large medical facility to earn LEED platinum certification for its environmentally sustainable design and operations. The complex houses the OHSU School of Dentistry and integrated spaces for students and faculty from OHSU, Portland State University and Oregon State University. This measure would have increased the tobacco tax and dedicated the new revenue to providing health care for children, low-income adults and other medically underserved Oregonians, and to fund tobacco prevention and education programs.

Health experts recommend that children visit a dentist by their first birthdays or when their first teeth come in, yet a nationwide poll shows that many parents fail to heed that advice. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., only 23 percent of 1-year-olds and 44 percent of 2-year-olds had visited a dentist. “Early assessment not only identifies children with decay but provides an opportunity for the parent or caregiver to get guidance on proper nutrition, oral hygiene and preventative care,” says Dr. Bill Kohn, vice president of dental science and policy for the Delta Dental Plans Association, a provider of dental insurance. Studies also show that parents who get their children early preventive dental care such as check-ups, cleanings, fluoride treatment and sealants can save on dental treatment costs down the road, Kohn says. If children don’t get the dental care they need, they’ll be at increased risk of developing dental decay, says Dr. Rhea Haugseth, president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Dental decay that goes untreated then can grow until it involves the pulp – the connective tissue that contains nerves and blood vessels, located in the center of a tooth. Worst-case scenario: An untreated systemic infection may lead to death. A number of studies show how pervasive a lack of proper dental care is. According to a study by the Pew Center on the States, about 17 million low-income children – one of every five kids – in the United States go without dental care every year.

        "context": "To improve the oral health of low-income children, innovations in dental delivery systems are needed, including community-based care, the use of expanded duty auxiliary dental personnel, capitation payments, and global budgets. Fourteen rural Oregon counties with a publicly insured (Medicaid) population of 82,000 children (0 to 21 years old) and pregnant women served by a managed dental care organization are randomized into test and control counties. In the control intervention, care is delivered in dental offices without performance incentives. The primary outcome is the prevalence of untreated dental caries. Data are collected through patient and staff surveys, clinical examinations, and the review of health and administrative records. If effective, PREDICT is expected to substantially reduce disparities in dental care and oral health. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Advantage Dental Services, LLC, are supporting the evaluation. Dental caries (tooth decay) predominantly afflict low-income children who also receive fewer dental services . Approximately 45 % of children 3 to 5 years old and fewer than 10 % of children younger than 2 years old received dental services in 2008 in the United States . Many children have their first dental visit in the Emergency Department, and surgical in-hospital treatment of dental caries is becoming more common and costly. Indeed, preventable dental conditions were the primary reason for 830,590 ED visits by Americans in 2009, a 16 % increase from 2006 . This is because early oral examination aids in the detection of the early stages of tooth decay. Early detection is essential to maintain oral health, modify aberrant habits, and treat as needed and as simply as possible. Additionally, parents are given a program of preventive home care (brushing, flossing and fluorides), a caries risk assessment, information on finger, thumb, and pacifier habits, and may include advice on preventing injuries to the mouth and teeth of children, diet counseling, and information on growth and development. Oregon Health & Science University is where healing, teaching and discovery come together. OHSU is also Portland's largest employer and a statewide economic powerhouse. Our operations include three campuses, adult and children’s hospitals, and clinics across Oregon. Learn more below and in the OHSU Fact Book. Patients who were admitted or transferred to an observation unit are counted in those categories. OHSU has provided care for uninsured and otherwise underserved people for more than 130 years. We provide more than 200 community health programs in rural and urban areas throughout Oregon. The Center for Health & Healing, completed in 2006, was the nation's first large medical facility to earn LEED platinum certification for its environmentally sustainable design and operations. The complex houses the OHSU School of Dentistry and integrated spaces for students and faculty from OHSU, Portland State University and Oregon State University. This measure would have increased the tobacco tax and dedicated the new revenue to providing health care for children, low-income adults and other medically underserved Oregonians, and to fund tobacco prevention and education programs.

First and foremost, it ensures equal access to education for all students, regardless of their mental health condition. Accommodations such as extended time for exams, modified attendance policies, or flexibility in assignment deadlines can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by students with mental illness. Moreover, academic accommodations can contribute to the overall mental well-being of students with mental illness. Importantly, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness is not just a matter of fairness, but also a legal obligation.

One potential source of exposure is the use of aluminum-containing over-the-counter remedies or medications such as antacids, buffered analgesics, anti-ulcer products, and anti-diarrheal remedies. Excessive use of aluminum cookware, utensils, and foil wraps with high acid foods like tomato can also be a source of exposure. It's important to note that the exposure to aluminum in cooking does not significantly add aluminum to food. However, individuals with preexisting medical conditions such as renal disease may be particularly at risk if exposed to large amounts of aluminum through these sources. This can put patients at risk for aluminum toxicity, which can manifest as osteodystrophy, encephalopathy, and anemia. Although aluminum is not typically absorbed in large amounts under normal circumstances, certain factors such as genetic predisposition, advanced age, or mucosal damage may enhance its absorption. This can lead to greater central nervous system exposure to aluminum and potentially contribute to its deposition in the brain, potentially contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease. It's worth mentioning that the association between aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease is still a topic of debate and ongoing research. Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between aluminum exposure and the development of toxic reactions like senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Studies have shown a link between susceptibility to toxins like aluminum and mercury and the onset of Alzheimer's and senile dementia. In the case of aluminum, it has been found in high levels in the brain cells of Alzheimer's patients, suggesting it may be a causal factor in the development of the disease. The exact source of aluminum toxicity is not yet proven, but it can enter the body through inhalation, oral ingestion, or leaching from various products like cooking utensils, cans, foil, underarm deodorants, and antacid pills. Many Americans are exposed to aluminum through aluminum pots, aluminum cans, aluminum-containing antacids and antiperspirants, aluminum foil, and tap water that may be high in aluminum.,  Considerable research has proven that brain neurons affected in Alzheimer's disease have significantly higher levels of aluminum than normal neurons. Aluminum is able to replace magnesium in certain enzyme systems in the body, mimicking its function but causing harm. Aluminum can also replace magnesium in the brain, which leaves calcium channels in the brain nerve cells wide open, allowing calcium to flood in, causing cell death. Grant already knew that people with Alzheimer's typically have elevated concentrations of aluminum in their brains.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike cited Medicaid expansion as reasons for their opposition to the ultimately failed American Health Care Act. Despite a major legislative setback, discussions around health care reform and the future of the Medicaid program continue. Following their failure to hold a vote on the misguided American Health Care Act (AHCA), congressional Republicans now head into a two-week recess with more questions than answers. And the reason for their continued failure hasn’t changed: the AHCA is a fundamentally flawed bill that would cause millions to lose health coverage\n\nThe need for substance use disorder treatment is acute.

Babies in the NICU \"often have a multitude of conditions that put them at risk for dying,\" Cooper said.

While human cases of EEE and West Nile are rare, both diseases can cause serious illness, permanent disability, and even death. Control efforts by state and local public health agencies are important, but the best protections are the actions individuals can take to reduce their risk of disease. Each year, the risks of Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile virus and Lyme disease cause concern among residents and prompt response by public health officials. This is especially true this year, as threats of EEE and West Nile virus are above normal, and the incidence of Lyme disease, along with other tick-borne illnesses such as babesiosis, continues to be high. Because of the increased threats of these diseases this year, the Massachusetts Medical Society, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and HCAM-TV have collaborated in producing a special edition of Physician Focus to raise awareness of these illnesses and encourage residents to take appropriate steps to protect themselves. Among the topics covered in this program by Dr. DeMaria and Dr. Brown are the dangers these threats pose to humans; the environmental conditions that contribute to these risks; why the risks of these diseases are greater this year than in previous years; control efforts undertaken by state and local agencies; who is most susceptible to getting these diseases; what you should do if you’ve been bitten by a tick; and the most effective steps individuals can take to protect against mosquito and tick bites. Control efforts by state and local public health agencies, such as ground and aerial spraying, are important in reducing the risks, but they can’t eliminate the risks entirely, say the doctors. Besides the discussion among the doctors, Mosquito and Tick-Borne Diseases contains two new public service announcements recorded by the guests. One focuses on mosquito-borne illnesses, and one on Lyme disease. With summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. Prevention and early detection are part of the safety protocol extended by the California Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as vector control and county health departments. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease are low. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. The rates of infection are 1 in 100,000, much lower than the national rate. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease).

In January 2018, when the shortage was projected to ease, flu season hit and lead to a spike in patients. The nationwide shortage of IV narcotic pain medications has had a significant impact on hospitals in the Virginia Peninsula area. Peninsula-area hospitals, such as Sentara, Riverside, and Bon Secours health systems, have reported struggling to stretch their supplies of IV narcotic pain medications due to the shortage. Shipments of major prescription opioid painkillers, including fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone, have been significantly reduced over the past few weeks, and the shortage is expected to persist for another year. As a result of the shortage, hospitals have been forced to conserve their IV supplies for patients with the greatest need and explore alternative treatments for others. The limited information provided by manufacturers has made the situation more challenging for hospitals in planning their strategies. Hospitals in the Virginia Peninsula area are particularly concerned about the impact of the shortage on patients who require IV opioid medications for trauma, surgery, or acute pain. These patients heavily rely on intravenous opioids for effective pain relief. Thus, the shortage poses a significant challenge in ensuring that these patients receive appropriate pain management. The shortage of IV narcotic pain medications is attributed partly to federal efforts to combat opioid abuse. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) implemented restrictions on production allotments for all opiate medications in 2018 as a measure to address the opioid epidemic. Additionally, the consolidation of major pharmaceutical companies has played a role in the shortages. In summary, the shortage of IV narcotic pain medications in the Virginia Peninsula area has forced hospitals to conserve supplies and seek alternative treatments for patients. Hospital officials are striving to manage the situation while prioritizing patients with the highest need for IV opioids. The shortage is a result of a combination of factors, including federal efforts to combat opioid abuse and the consolidation of pharmaceutical companies. Thus, patient care may suffer significantly as a result. Delayed and cancelled care have been reported from medicines shortages. In fact 90 percent hospitals in the United States reported they have experienced at least one shortage in the past six months that affected patient safety and 99 percent of medicine shortages forces them to purchase a more expensive alternative with the result of an increase in health care cost. Hence, shortages of Buspirone will have a potential clinical impact. There are many potential reasons for medicines shortages including demand and supply issues, disturbances within the supply chain, regulatory issues including long timelines of approval and inadequate incentives.

Peninsula-area hospitals are struggling to stretch supplies of IV narcotic pain medications after a nationwide shortage has left many pharmacy shelves bare. Shipments of three major prescription opioid painkillers — fentanyl, morphine and hydromorphone — started to stall late last summer and have been significantly reduced over the last handful of weeks. Officials from Sentara, Riverside and Bon Secours health systems confirmed local hospitals have been impacted by the shortage, which could persist for another year. The shortages have forced hospitals to conserve IV supplies for the patients with the greatest need and seek alternative treatments for others. But for some patients who suffer trauma or have surgery or other acute pain, opioids administered intravenously are the only way to effectively give them relief. “That is where we need to make sure we have intravenous product,” Jennings said. Officials said the shortages are partly because of federal efforts to crack down on opioid abuse. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, put restrictions on production allotments for all opiate medications in 2018. The officials said they are conserving supplies on hand since they are not certain if their full orders will be filled or even when shipments will arrive. Before the shortage, hospitals might have given intravenous opioids to people who were able to swallow a pill because IV drugs provide pain relief more quickly. If the patient is able to swallow a pill, that is the method of pain relief. The officials said the shortages have also pushed hospitals to consider more non-opioid alternatives to relieving pain.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Peninsula-area hospitals are struggling to stretch supplies of IV narcotic pain medications after a nationwide shortage has left many pharmacy shelves bare. Shipments of three major prescription opioid painkillers — fentanyl, morphine and hydromorphone — started to stall late last summer and have been significantly reduced over the last handful of weeks. Officials from Sentara, Riverside and Bon Secours health systems confirmed local hospitals have been impacted by the shortage, which could persist for another year. The shortages have forced hospitals to conserve IV supplies for the patients with the greatest need and seek alternative treatments for others. But for some patients who suffer trauma or have surgery or other acute pain, opioids administered intravenously are the only way to effectively give them relief. “That is where we need to make sure we have intravenous product,” Jennings said. Officials said the shortages are partly because of federal efforts to crack down on opioid abuse. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, put restrictions on production allotments for all opiate medications in 2018. The officials said they are conserving supplies on hand since they are not certain if their full orders will be filled or even when shipments will arrive. Before the shortage, hospitals might have given intravenous opioids to people who were able to swallow a pill because IV drugs provide pain relief more quickly. If the patient is able to swallow a pill, that is the method of pain relief. The officials said the shortages have also pushed hospitals to consider more non-opioid alternatives to relieving pain.\n\n"

This 3D visualization enhances precision and accuracy during the procedure. Furthermore, the use of surgical robots has further enhanced laparoscopic surgery by providing the surgeon with even greater dexterity and control. Robotic arms controlled by the surgeon indirectly manipulate the surgical instruments, offering enhanced precision and a wider range of movement. Robotic systems also provide surgeons with a 3D view of the surgical field, allowing for better depth perception and spatial awareness. This helps in performing complex procedures such as prostatectomy and cholecystectomy with improved accuracy and reduced risk. In summary, the advantages of using laparoscopic surgery and surgical robots in various procedures include smaller incisions, reduced postoperative pain, shorter recovery times, improved visualization, enhanced maneuverability, and greater precision. These advancements have revolutionized the field of surgery and contributed to improved patient outcomes. The first surgical robot approved by the FDA is the da Vinci system. These include image-guided robots that, in addition to the direct visual feedback, use medical images for guiding the intervention. These procedures are usually performed through large abdominal incisions resulting in significant postoperative pain, blood loss and scarring. A decade ago laparoscopic technology revolutionized the field of surgery, creating a new generation of minimally invasive procedures. Today, surgeons at RWJBarnabas Health have taken that technology one step further. They are using robotics to perform both living donor nephrectomies (kidney removal) and implantation of the kidney into the recipient. \"Robot-assisted technology is a remarkable surgical tool. The surgeon uses hand controls and foot pedals to manipulate the robotic arms. These pencil-sized probes translate the surgeon's hand movements and adjust themselves to compensate for the natural tremor of the human hand.

This 3D visualization enhances precision and accuracy during the procedure. Furthermore, the use of surgical robots has further enhanced laparoscopic surgery by providing the surgeon with even greater dexterity and control. Robotic arms controlled by the surgeon indirectly manipulate the surgical instruments, offering enhanced precision and a wider range of movement. Robotic systems also provide surgeons with a 3D view of the surgical field, allowing for better depth perception and spatial awareness. This helps in performing complex procedures such as prostatectomy and cholecystectomy with improved accuracy and reduced risk. In summary, the advantages of using laparoscopic surgery and surgical robots in various procedures include smaller incisions, reduced postoperative pain, shorter recovery times, improved visualization, enhanced maneuverability, and greater precision. These advancements have revolutionized the field of surgery and contributed to improved patient outcomes. The first surgical robot approved by the FDA is the da Vinci system. These include image-guided robots that, in addition to the direct visual feedback, use medical images for guiding the intervention. These procedures are usually performed through large abdominal incisions resulting in significant postoperative pain, blood loss and scarring. A decade ago laparoscopic technology revolutionized the field of surgery, creating a new generation of minimally invasive procedures. Today, surgeons at RWJBarnabas Health have taken that technology one step further. They are using robotics to perform both living donor nephrectomies (kidney removal) and implantation of the kidney into the recipient. \"Robot-assisted technology is a remarkable surgical tool. The surgeon uses hand controls and foot pedals to manipulate the robotic arms. These pencil-sized probes translate the surgeon's hand movements and adjust themselves to compensate for the natural tremor of the human hand. For the patient, robot-assisted surgery is safe, minimally invasive and offers faster recovery time. Robotic surgery has allowed surgeons the ability to perform procedures for the prostate, kidneys and bladder with minimally invasive incisions.\n\n"

The new test measures a protein that is released to the bloodstream by dying heart muscle. \"This is a potential ultra-early biomarker that could confirm whether a patient has had a heart attack, leading to faster and more effective treatment,\" said Sakthivel Sadayappan, PhD, senior author of the study, published in the American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology. Many of these patients are admitted to the hospital, at considerable time and expense, until a heart attack is definitively ruled out. An electrocardiogram can diagnose major heart attacks, but not minor ones. There also are blood tests for various proteins associated with heart attacks. The only protein now used in blood tests that is specific to the heart is called cardiac troponin-I. It's the gold standard for detecting heart attacks. But it takes at least four to six hours for this protein to show up in the blood following a heart attack. In a separate analysis of 12 cardiac patients who underwent a procedure that mimicked a minor heart attack, researchers found that cMyBP-C levels peaked four hours after the procedure. Researchers found similar results in a porcine model of heart attack. If a patient arrives at the emergency department with chest pain, they're hooked up to an electrocardiogram that shows their heart rhythm. If they are in the middle of having a heart attack, the EKG shows this. That's why doctors also use a blood test that measures levels of a biomarker called troponin. At this point, physicians can admit people into the hospital to have an exercise stress test. This test may show heart disease that an EKG or a troponin test missed. It's these low-to-intermediate risk patients that we're most concerned about, and a lot of doctors are hesitant to send patients home without imaging or stress testing, because you don't want to miss a potential heart attack,\" Glatter said. Using this technology allows doctors to see if there is any plaque buildup in the blood vessels leading to the heart that could be limiting the supply of blood reaching the heart. In the current study, Hoffmann and his colleagues\n\nRoutine blood tests given to people suspected of having a heart attack can also reliably measure the risk of heart disease in people on dialysis awaiting a kidney transplant, even though they have no symptoms of heart disease. Thats according to a team of researchers led by a University of Maryland cardiologist. Their study is published in the July 16, 2003 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The tests, which measure troponin T and C-reactive protein, appear to detect silent, small heart attacks and coronary artery disease. The results may make it possible, for the first time, for doctors to gauge the risk of heart disease in patients on dialysis who do not have cardiac symptoms, and determine which patients need additional treatment to address their underlying cardiovascular disease. Blood samples were taken from each patient to measure two powerful predictors of acute coronary syndromes, cardiac troponin T and C-reactive protein. The patients were then followed for 3½ years to investigate any association between the test results and the long-term risk of cardiac problems and death. To analyze whether the blood tests were reliable predictors of death, investigators divided the patients into one of four groups, based on whether their test results fell at, above or below the medians for troponin T and C-reactive protein. If doctors suspect a heart attack, they often conduct a test to measure troponin proteins in the blood. The proteins are released by the body when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as when a heart attack occurs, according to the National Institutes of Health. Women do not produce as much troponin protein as men, which may mask a serious heart condition and lead to delayed treatment. A test developed by Abbott may help remedy the troponin dilemma. The test, run in a laboratory setting, measures troponin in a patient's serum and plasma. A study in The Lancet shows that the ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I test successfully aided doctors in identifying people at risk for heart attack and helped physicians make treatment decisions about which people should stay in the hospital. Another analysis published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found the high sensitive troponin test may also detect whether stress — mental and physical — triggers an inadequate oxygen supply to the heart among people with coronary artery disease. The test may greatly benefit women since their peak troponin levels are more difficult to detect. A new study suggests that a NICE-approved test for heart attacks could detect twice as many heart attacks in women than current standard tests. Published in the BMJ, the research found that a test which NICE recommends for speeding up diagnosis, could also double the proportion of women who were diagnosed with a heart attack and so bring rates in line with those among men. To diagnose whether a heart attack has occurred in these cases, doctors can measure the level of a protein called troponin in the blood. This is because troponin is often released when the heart has been damaged due to a heart attack. In September last year, NICE published guidance which recommends two new high-sensitivity troponin tests. The tests detect lower levels of troponin in the blood than standard tests, and so can detect a change in levels of troponin earlier, allowing patients who have not had a heart attack to be discharged earlier. They found that the higher sensitivity test increased diagnosis of myocardial infarction from 11 per cent to 22 percent in women, and increased rates from 19 to 21 per cent in men. When the researchers took this into account, they found that twice as many women would be diagnosed with a heart attack.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": "MAYWOOD, Ill. - A new blood test can detect heart attacks hours faster than the current gold-standard blood test, according to a study led by Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine researchers. The new test measures a protein that is released to the bloodstream by dying heart muscle. \"This is a potential ultra-early biomarker that could confirm whether a patient has had a heart attack, leading to faster and more effective treatment,\" said Sakthivel Sadayappan, PhD, senior author of the study, published in the American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology. Many of these patients are admitted to the hospital, at considerable time and expense, until a heart attack is definitively ruled out. An electrocardiogram can diagnose major heart attacks, but not minor ones. There also are blood tests for various proteins associated with heart attacks. The only protein now used in blood tests that is specific to the heart is called cardiac troponin-I. It's the gold standard for detecting heart attacks. But it takes at least four to six hours for this protein to show up in the blood following a heart attack. In a separate analysis of 12 cardiac patients who underwent a procedure that mimicked a minor heart attack, researchers found that cMyBP-C levels peaked four hours after the procedure. Researchers found similar results in a porcine model of heart attack. If a patient arrives at the emergency department with chest pain, they're hooked up to an electrocardiogram that shows their heart rhythm. If they are in the middle of having a heart attack, the EKG shows this. That's why doctors also use a blood test that measures levels of a biomarker called troponin. At this point, physicians can admit people into the hospital to have an exercise stress test. This test may show heart disease that an EKG or a troponin test missed. It's these low-to-intermediate risk patients that we're most concerned about, and a lot of doctors are hesitant to send patients home without imaging or stress testing, because you don't want to miss a potential heart attack,\" Glatter said. Using this technology allows doctors to see if there is any plaque buildup in the blood vessels leading to the heart that could be limiting the supply of blood reaching the heart. In the current study, Hoffmann and his colleagues\n\nRoutine blood tests given to people suspected of having a heart attack can also reliably measure the risk of heart disease in people on dialysis awaiting a kidney transplant, even though they have no symptoms of heart disease. Thats according to a team of researchers led by a University of Maryland cardiologist. Their study is published in the July 16, 2003 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The tests, which measure troponin T and C-reactive protein, appear to detect silent, small heart attacks and coronary artery disease. The results may make it possible, for the first time, for doctors to gauge the risk of heart disease in patients on dialysis who do not have cardiac symptoms, and determine which patients need additional treatment to address their underlying cardiovascular disease. Blood samples were taken from each patient to measure two powerful predictors of acute coronary syndromes, cardiac troponin T and C-reactive protein. The patients were then followed for 3½ years to investigate any association between the test results and the long-term risk of cardiac problems and death. To analyze whether the blood tests were reliable predictors of death, investigators divided the patients into one of four groups, based on whether their test results fell at, above or below the medians for troponin T and C-reactive protein. If doctors suspect a heart attack, they often conduct a test to measure troponin proteins in the blood. The proteins are released by the body when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as when a heart attack occurs, according to the National Institutes of Health. Women do not produce as much troponin protein as men, which may mask a serious heart condition and lead to delayed treatment. A test developed by Abbott may help remedy the troponin dilemma. The test, run in a laboratory setting, measures troponin in a patient's serum and plasma.

A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that approximately 600,000 children die each year due to air pollution, with 93% of children worldwide living in environments exceeding WHO guidelines. Environmental risks are responsible for over 25% of deaths in this age group. The impact of air pollution extends prominently to low- and middle-income countries, especially those in Africa, South-East Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean, where about 90% of pollution-related deaths in children occur. Several adverse effects are associated with air pollution on children's health. Infants exposed to polluted air may experience stillbirths, while children of all ages are susceptible to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. Additionally, air pollution has been implicated in obesity, reduced IQ, stunted cognitive development, and an increased risk of cancer. The study conducted by the WHO specifically identified particulate matter, including toxins like sulfate and black carbon, as major contributors to health issues, such as strokes, heart disease, pneumonia, and lung cancer in children. Both ambient and household air pollution contribute to these adverse effects. Household air pollution commonly arises from the use of polluting fuels for cooking and heating, indoor smoking, and exposure to various household toxins. Poverty exacerbates the effects of air pollution, as limited access to information, healthcare resources, and clean cooking fuels contribute to the problem. Implementing stricter regulations and utilizing cleaner energy sources can significantly improve ambient air quality and protect children from its adverse effects.

In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, \"I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves.\" She died there on 12 May 1995.

In its Opinion, published 27 June 2019, the Council states that it is not a purely private matter, but rather a moral duty to have oneself and one's own children vaccinated against a highly contagious infectious disease such as measles. At the time of publication of its Opinion, the Council considers such a mandatory vaccination policy only to be appropriate for personnel in the health, social and educational sectors. However, the Council recommends a number of other measures, which, taken together, could be suitable to close any remaining vaccination gaps and achieve the goal of eliminating measles permanently. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in others, as part of their public health system. Some governments pay all or part of the costs of vaccinations for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule. Besides individual protection from getting ill, some vaccination policies also aim to provide the community as a whole with herd immunity. Victory is also claimed for getting rid of endemic measles, mumps and rubella in Finland. However, if a vaccination program successfully reduces the disease threat, it may reduce the perceived risk of disease enough so that an individual's optimal strategy is to encourage everyone but their family to be vaccinated, or (more generally) to refuse vaccination at coverage levels below those optimal for the community. For example, a 2003 study found that a bioterrorist attack using smallpox would result in conditions where voluntary vaccination would be unlikely to reach the optimum level for the U.S. as a whole, and a 2007 study found that severe influenza epidemics cannot be prevented by voluntary vaccination without offering certain incentives. Governments often allow exemptions to mandatory vaccinations for religious or philosophical reasons, but some believe that decreased rates of vaccination may cause loss of herd immunity, substantially increasing risks even to vaccinated individuals. To eliminate the risk of disease outbreaks, at various times governments and other institutions established policies requiring vaccination.

Some governments pay all or part of the costs of vaccinations for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule. Besides individual protection from getting ill, some vaccination policies also aim to provide the community as a whole with herd immunity. Victory is also claimed for getting rid of endemic measles, mumps and rubella in Finland. However, if a vaccination program successfully reduces the disease threat, it may reduce the perceived risk of disease enough so that an individual's optimal strategy is to encourage everyone but their family to be vaccinated, or (more generally) to refuse vaccination at coverage levels below those optimal for the community. For example, a 2003 study found that a bioterrorist attack using smallpox would result in conditions where voluntary vaccination would be unlikely to reach the optimum level for the U.S. as a whole, and a 2007 study found that severe influenza epidemics cannot be prevented by voluntary vaccination without offering certain incentives. Governments often allow exemptions to mandatory vaccinations for religious or philosophical reasons, but some believe that decreased rates of vaccination may cause loss of herd immunity, substantially increasing risks even to vaccinated individuals. To eliminate the risk of disease outbreaks, at various times governments and other institutions established policies requiring vaccination. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales, with fines levied on people who did not comply. In the United States, the Supreme Court ruled\n\n In February 2020, Noem announced her opposition to a bill prohibiting schools and universities from requiring students to get vaccinated.\n\n"

The social history revealed that the mother was known to smoke marijuana frequently, and had a positive urine drug testing for marijuana during this pregnancy. A male sibling had also been admitted for an unintentional cannabis exposure after the toddler had ingested his mother’s unfinished marijuana cigarette. The father of the baby smoked cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, and had some beers on the weekend. The diagnosis of a healthy female with prenatal cannabis exposure was made. A urine toxicology screening was sent on the infant and eventually was positive for cannabis only. Cannabis is used by about 3.9% of the world’s population. For drug users, it is the most commonly abused drug. Up to ~40% of adults have used cannabis at some time in their lifetime. Marijuana use is on the increase for teens with an overall use of ~7% and ~23% of 12th graders in the U.S. have used it in the past month (Data from 2013).

The social history revealed that the mother was known to smoke marijuana frequently, and had a positive urine drug testing for marijuana during this pregnancy. A male sibling had also been admitted for an unintentional cannabis exposure after the toddler had ingested his mother’s unfinished marijuana cigarette. The father of the baby smoked cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, and had some beers on the weekend. The diagnosis of a healthy female with prenatal cannabis exposure was made. A urine toxicology screening was sent on the infant and eventually was positive for cannabis only. Cannabis is used by about 3.9% of the world’s population. For drug users, it is the most commonly abused drug. Up to ~40% of adults have used cannabis at some time in their lifetime. Marijuana use is on the increase for teens with an overall use of ~7% and ~23% of 12th graders in the U.S. have used it in the past month (Data from 2013).

Traditional implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) include electrical conducting wires inserted into blood vessels that touch the heart. Patients with certain types of pacemakers, and those with symptoms related to a slow heartbeat, should not use an S-ICD®System.

In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. It is a device that continuously monitors the heart rhythm. If it detects an abnormally fast heart rhythm, it either electrically paces the heart very fast or delivers a small electrical shock to the heart to convert the heart rhythm back to normal. The device is normally used for the instantaneous treatment of immediately life threatening heart rhythms (i.e., ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) that often can't wait for treatment until an ambulance arrives. Some people are now studying the use of these devices for the treatment of less dangerous heart rhythms as well, such as atrial fibrillation. The device is implanted in an operating room under deep sedation and is connected to the heart using special AIDC (Automatic internal defibrillator cardioverter) leads. Older devices were implanted in the abdominal wall but the newer, smaller devices are implanted under the collarbone, similar to a standard pacemaker. Leads run from the device through a vein into the heart. These devices can also act like a standard pacemaker and pace the heart if it ever beats too slowly. Like a pacemaker, these devices must be continually monitored. A device placed on the skin overlying the device can find out about how the device has been programmed, determine the status of the battery, see if any pacing or shocks were given and the heart rhythm that was treated. The programming of the device can be modified as needed to best suit the patient's needs. When this happens, the old device is removed and a new device is implanted. The patient is generally brought into the office the next working day to interrogate the device. These devices are not perfect. Sometimes they deliver therapy for non-life threatening fast heart rhythms. That is why it always important to interrogate the device after any shocks are felt by the patient. The programming or medications may then be altered based on what type of heart rhythm received the shock. June 27, 2018 — Wearable cardioverter defibrillators may be a safe and effective alternative to surgically implanted devices in children with ventricular heart rhythm disorders that put them at risk for sudden cardiac death, according to new research. With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs, and death can occur if the heart’s rhythm is not restored or corrected. Surgically implanted cardioverter defibrillators — the main therapy for children at high-risk for sudden cardiac death due to heart rhythm disorders, known as arrythmias — are effective in averting deaths from potentially lethal heart rhythms, but invasive surgery or prolonged hospitalization is required. However, many young patients are not good candidates for these surgically implanted devices because they need only a temporary “bridge” to help their heart. For example, if they are waiting for a heart transplant, are a newly diagnosed heart failure patient who is recovering cardiac function or if they have an infected implanted cardioverter defibrillator, they would not be good candidates, Spar explained. Even though wearable cardioverter defibrillators were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pediatric patients in 2015, data about their safety and efficacy in children has remained limited. This gap in knowledge has been particularly troublesome in how effective the device would be in younger patients in treating dangerous arrhythmias. Of the 455 patients (average age 15) included in the analysis, eight (1.8 percent) received at least one shock treatment to interrupt a dangerous heart rhythm.

This report describes the ongoing investigation by members of OutbreakNet* and others and the measures undertaken to control the outbreak, which is the first outbreak of foodborne botulism in the United States associated with a commercial canning facility in approximately 30 years. Consumers should not eat any of the recalled chili sauce or other recalled products and should carefully dispose of all recalled products. Information regarding product disposal is available at http://www.cdc.gov/botulism/botulism_faq.htm. On July 7, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported to CDC two suspected cases of foodborne botulism in children who are siblings.

Primary care providers have reported a lower level of integration between physical and behavioral health at the clinic. For more information, you can refer to the 2010 IBHP Final Report. In Colorado, there is the Sustaining Healthcare Across Integrated Primary Care Efforts (SHAPE) project. It brings together Rocky Mountain Health Plans, University of Colorado Denver Department of Family Medicine, and the Collaborative Family Health Association. The project has projected potential savings of $656 Million on a population of one million patients who have conditions like arthritis, asthma, diabetes, or hypertension in conjunction with a behavioral health condition. According to MCPAP's Fiscal Year 2012 Statewide Data study, successes in each of their distinct categories have increased as much as 57% since 2005. It has made significant advancements in improving healthcare for people with depression by changing the way care is delivered and paid for. These initiatives in different states reflect efforts to integrate behavioral health services into primary care settings, aiming to improve patient outcomes and provide more comprehensive care. Many states are implementing health homes for persons with complex chronic conditions, including serious mental illness and behavioral health issues, as a strategy to improve the patient experience and health care outcomes as well as reduce costs. By wrapping health and social services around medically complex Medicaid/Medicaid beneficiaries and improving care coordination, states, health plans and provider systems intend to demonstrate reduced hospitalizations, emergency room use and avoidable admissions. In 2007, several medical associations issued the Joint Principles of Patient-Centered Medical Homes which set forth standards governing these new organizations, including: on-going client relationship with a personal physician; physician-directed multi-disciplinary team to provide services; whole person orientation; coordinated care; outcomes-oriented and evidenced-based treatment; enhanced access to treatment; and reimbursement commensurate with the services offered. In 2008, The Commonwealth Fund, in concert with other organizations, initiated a five-year demonstration project to help primary care safety net sites become high-performing patient-centered medical homes. Additional information can be found at the NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Home and the Patient Centered Medical Home Resource Center websites. Missouri’s Primary Care Practice Health Homes website provides descriptions, flow charts, MOU’s and other valuable information. The Integrated Care Resource Center provides technical assistance to state Medicaid agencies that seek to amend their Medicaid plan to implement Health Homes for chronic conditions. IBHP’s survey of 590 physical and behavioral health providers and students found that over half had “limited” or “no knowledge” of important aspects of health reform such as patient eligibility, population health management and performance incentives. In seeking to address whole health needs, public systems are particularly seeking new approaches for individuals and communities with high incidence of co-occurring medical, mental health and/or substance abuse issues. Addressing adverse social factors is critical to improving outcomes for these high need individuals, and thus the integration of social services, housing and health is very important. Meanwhile, demand for mental health services is on the rise. Primary care practitioners are living with the fallout. Meanwhile, half the patients referred by a primary care provider for psychiatric treatment are unable to access services. The idea is to train front-line providers in the essentials of primary-care-based psychiatry. We train primary care providers to recognize symptoms of common psychiatric conditions, complete a quick and targeted assessment, and provide evidence-based treatment using cognitive therapy techniques, motivational interviewing and appropriate medications. Are we creating a replacement for psychiatrists? Our fellows are trained in the basics of treating mild to moderate illnesses, including anxiety and depression. The cost of the program is $15,000 per fellow, and we discourage providers from paying out of pocket. As the program continues, we’ll be actively measuring outcomes. For a more detailed analysis, please reference the 2010 IBHP Final Report. Colorado: Sustaining Healthcare Across Integrated Primary Care Efforts (SHAPE) is a project that brings together Rocky Mountain Health Plans, University of Colorado Denver Department of Family Medicine and the Collaborative Family Health Association. Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) is an interdisciplinary healthcare initiative that assists primary care providers (PCPs) who treat children and adolescents for psychiatric conditions. Missouri: Community Mental Health Case Management (CMHCM) is a program that establishes a relationship between a case manager and a patient resulting in face-to-face assistance in a patient’s home or a community setting. In a 2010 study, CMHCMs were instrumental in lowering health care costs. Since implementation, these costs are falling by an average of $500.

        "context": "Its aim is to accelerate the integration of behavioral health services into primary care settings. Primary care providers have reported a lower level of integration between physical and behavioral health at the clinic. For more information, you can refer to the 2010 IBHP Final Report. In Colorado, there is the Sustaining Healthcare Across Integrated Primary Care Efforts (SHAPE) project. It brings together Rocky Mountain Health Plans, University of Colorado Denver Department of Family Medicine, and the Collaborative Family Health Association. The project has projected potential savings of $656 Million on a population of one million patients who have conditions like arthritis, asthma, diabetes, or hypertension in conjunction with a behavioral health condition. According to MCPAP's Fiscal Year 2012 Statewide Data study, successes in each of their distinct categories have increased as much as 57% since 2005. It has made significant advancements in improving healthcare for people with depression by changing the way care is delivered and paid for. These initiatives in different states reflect efforts to integrate behavioral health services into primary care settings, aiming to improve patient outcomes and provide more comprehensive care. Many states are implementing health homes for persons with complex chronic conditions, including serious mental illness and behavioral health issues, as a strategy to improve the patient experience and health care outcomes as well as reduce costs. By wrapping health and social services around medically complex Medicaid/Medicaid beneficiaries and improving care coordination, states, health plans and provider systems intend to demonstrate reduced hospitalizations, emergency room use and avoidable admissions. In 2007, several medical associations issued the Joint Principles of Patient-Centered Medical Homes which set forth standards governing these new organizations, including: on-going client relationship with a personal physician; physician-directed multi-disciplinary team to provide services; whole person orientation; coordinated care; outcomes-oriented and evidenced-based treatment; enhanced access to treatment; and reimbursement commensurate with the services offered. In 2008, The Commonwealth Fund, in concert with other organizations, initiated a five-year demonstration project to help primary care safety net sites become high-performing patient-centered medical homes. Additional information can be found at the NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Home and the Patient Centered Medical Home Resource Center websites. Missouri’s Primary Care Practice Health Homes website provides descriptions, flow charts, MOU’s and other valuable information. The Integrated Care Resource Center provides technical assistance to state Medicaid agencies that seek to amend their Medicaid plan to implement Health Homes for chronic conditions. IBHP’s survey of 590 physical and behavioral health providers and students found that over half had “limited” or “no knowledge” of important aspects of health reform such as patient eligibility, population health management and performance incentives. In seeking to address whole health needs, public systems are particularly seeking new approaches for individuals and communities with high incidence of co-occurring medical, mental health and/or substance abuse issues. Addressing adverse social factors is critical to improving outcomes for these high need individuals, and thus the integration of social services, housing and health is very important. Meanwhile, demand for mental health services is on the rise. Primary care practitioners are living with the fallout. Meanwhile, half the patients referred by a primary care provider for psychiatric treatment are unable to access services. The idea is to train front-line providers in the essentials of primary-care-based psychiatry. We train primary care providers to recognize symptoms of common psychiatric conditions, complete a quick and targeted assessment, and provide evidence-based treatment using cognitive therapy techniques, motivational interviewing and appropriate medications. Are we creating a replacement for psychiatrists? Our fellows are trained in the basics of treating mild to moderate illnesses, including anxiety and depression. The cost of the program is $15,000 per fellow, and we discourage providers from paying out of pocket. As the program continues, we’ll be actively measuring outcomes. For a more detailed analysis, please reference the 2010 IBHP Final Report. Colorado: Sustaining Healthcare Across Integrated Primary Care Efforts (SHAPE) is a project that brings together Rocky Mountain Health Plans, University of Colorado Denver Department of Family Medicine and the Collaborative Family Health Association. Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) is an interdisciplinary healthcare initiative that assists primary care providers (PCPs) who treat children and adolescents for psychiatric conditions. Missouri: Community Mental Health Case Management (CMHCM) is a program that establishes a relationship between a case manager and a patient resulting in face-to-face assistance in a patient’s home or a community setting. In a 2010 study, CMHCMs were instrumental in lowering health care costs. Since implementation, these costs are falling by an average of $500.

Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC \n\n  A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.

Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC \n\n  A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses.\n\n"

Researchers at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto found the guidelines, which were rewritten in 2012, reduced Pap smear rates by 60 per cent in the year after their introduction -- and that led to a 50 per cent drop in gonorrhea and chlamydia testing among women aged 15 to 24. Patients were also less likely to be screened for syphilis, hepatitis C and HIV. After three normal Pap test results, subsequent screening was recommended every two or three years until age 70. The updated guidelines by Cancer Care Ontario recommend starting Pap tests at age 21 for women who have been sexually active, with three-year screening intervals if test results are normal. The advice differs slightly from guidelines by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, which recommends that routine Pap tests for women start at age 25 and continue every three years until age 70, when they can cease if a woman has had three successive negative tests in the previous 10 years. \"Historically, we know that Pap tests and STI screening are linked because they're often performed at the same time,\" said lead author Dr. Tali Bogler, a family physician at St. Mike's.

The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group.

This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery.

What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). The results obtained by these methods should be interpreted in the context of clinical, electrographic, and MRI data. Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery. Patient criteria Because of the\n\nWhat are the different types of clinical seizures? Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). The results obtained by these methods should be interpreted in the context of clinical, electrographic, and MRI data. Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy.\n\n"

Over the past century, researchers have tested bed bugs for everything from the plague to leprosy to hepatitis and AIDS. Scientists fed bed bugs blood laced with pathogens to see if any viruses could be transmitted via their bites. Every test confirmed that no diseases were capable of being spread from bed bugs to humans. However the long-held belief that bed bugs don’t spread disease has recently been shaken. The study revealed that bed bugs might transmit a parasite that causes Chagas disease, an infection prevalent in Mexico, Central America and South America that can lead to intestinal complications or cardiac disease. His research involved a set of experiments demonstrating that both mice and bed bugs are capable of transmitting Chagas to one another. The experiments showed that mice could contract Chagas if contaminated bed bug feces comes into contact with their broken skin. Melissa Nolan Garcia, an epidemiologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, says the Triatominae insect, also known as the ‘kissing bug’ is a confirmed carrier of Chagas. These large bloodsuckers are closely related to bed bugs, and earned their name from their tendency to bite victims around the mouth. Levy noted that humans may encounter bed bugs more frequently than kissing bugs, and bed bugs are more difficult to eradicate due to their resistance to modern pesticides. This means bed bugs may ultimately prove more dangerous than kissing bugs. “As we’ve seen over and over again in bug-borne diseases, the bugs spread first and then the parasite comes, and then the parasite emerges in the bugs,” said Levy.

The Casper-Natrona County Health Department offers the hepatitis A series vaccine; some people may qualify for free or discounted vaccine.

The product was recalled under its Townsend Farms brand at Costco and private labeled at Harris Teeter, and later linked to Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading in Turkey by the FDA. The cannery itself had a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, which may have caused two waves of infections affecting at least 48 people. The cannery did not shut down, and the outbreak spread for weeks before the state was notified. two weeks all employees of the facility were recommended for virus testing. A representative of the Alberta chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said that \"cases at Cargill were causing a cross-contamination\"—of the five workers at High River's Seasons Retirement Communities who tested positive for the coronavirus, three were married to Cargill workers. The CBC reported that Cargill slaughterhouse workers were pressured to return to their jobs after testing positive for COVID-19 and being legally required to quarantine themselves. Hearings before the Alberta Labour Relations Board on a stop-work order, sought by the United Food and Commercial Workers \n\nIn August 2016, a hepatitis A outbreak began in southeast Michigan. Since then, the outbreak has grown to other parts of the state. In December 2017, Eaton County had its first case of hepatitis A that was linked to the outbreak. In January 2018, Eaton County officially became part of the statewide outbreak. Since December 2017, Eaton County has had 5 cases of hepatitis A linked to the Michigan outbreak with one death. Barry County has not yet had any cases linked to the outbreak. For more information on the statewide outbreak, see the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services' outbreak page. BEDHD’s Charlotte office offers hepatitis A vaccinations by appointment Monday through Friday, 8am–5pm (clinic is closed 12-1pm for lunch). For more information, call (517) 541-2630. To get vaccinated at BEDHD's Hastings office, please call (269) 798-4133 for an appointment. Washtenaw County Public Health has confirmed a positive case of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in a worker from Cardamom Restaurant in Ann Arbor located at 1739 Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor. Please be advised that Michigan Medicine workforce members who may have been exposed can receive a vaccine from Occupational Health Services, but will need to follow up with their primary care provider if immune globulin is required. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reports that transmission in this outbreak appears to be related to direct person to person spread and illicit drug use. More information related to the outbreak may be found by clicking here. Vaccine is available via Occupational Health Services Monday-Friday, 7 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Please notify the Department of Infection Prevention & Epidemiology if you identify a patient with suspected or confirmed HAV at 936-6355 or page 30032.\n\n"

One group of dogs showed high IgG and low IgM values at the first sampling post-vaccination and during the following 14 days, indicating that they had previously been in contact with the virus, either by vaccination or infection before arrival at the animal shelter. A second group of dogs appeared to be unvaccinated or uninfected before arrival at the animal shelter because they had negative IgM and IgG values soon after vaccination. Having a clearly defined vaccination program for animals in animal shelters is important for several reasons. Animal shelters often have a random source population with unknown vaccination histories, high population turnover, and a high risk of infectious diseases. Vaccinating animals in shelters helps to protect them from common and potentially devastating diseases. Without proper vaccination, these animals are at an increased risk of contracting and spreading diseases such as parvovirus, distemper, rabies, and respiratory infections. This helps to prevent outbreaks within the shelter population and reduces the risk of transmitting diseases to adopters or other animals in the community. Additionally, vaccinations can help improve the overall health and welfare of shelter animals. By vaccinating animals in shelters, we can provide them with protection against common infectious agents they may encounter during their stay or after adoption. It is important to note that each shelter may have slightly different vaccination protocols based on their specific circumstances. Reference:\n- \"Vaccination of dogs and cats in the shelter environment\"\n\n Captive raccoon dogs in Soviet state animal farms were recorded to carry paratyphoid, anthrax, and tuberculosis. Some common diseases that can affect dogs include rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, canine parainfluenza, canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2, canine bordetella, canine borreliosis (Lyme disease), feline panleukopenia, feline rhinotracheitis, and feline calicivirus. Let's discuss the importance of vaccinating dogs against some of these diseases:\n\n1. Canine Distemper: This is a highly contagious viral disease that affects the respiratory and nervous systems in dogs. Puppies are particularly vulnerable to the disease, and vaccination starting at 6 to 12 weeks of age is crucial in preventing its spread. Canine Bordetella: Also known as kennel cough, this bacterial infection often occurs in dogs that are frequently in close proximity to other dogs, such as in kennels or shelters. These are just a few examples, but it is important to consult with a veterinarian to determine the appropriate vaccinations for your dog based on their age, lifestyle, and geographical location. Vaccinations are an essential component of preventive healthcare for dogs and can help them live longer, healthier lives. Vaccinate annually and remember to isolate your new puppy until they are current on all vaccines. This vaccination is also required for boarding at Hartwood. *Note: Canine Distemper is not related to feline distemper. Hepatitis only affects dogs and has a high mortality rate. It is typically found in puppies under the age of 6 months, unvaccinated pets, and senior patients. There are Parvo outbreaks in Animal Shelters and breeding facilities every day.

This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally \n\nThere have been claims suggesting a potential relationship between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism in children with bowel symptoms. These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of partial genome sequencing indicated that this virus was not Lassavirus and likely a previously unreported arenavirus. This was corroborated by full genome sequencing that was conducted by the NICD-NHLS, CDC and collaborators from Columbia University in New York. A Nipah virus infection is a viral infection caused by the Nipah virus. Symptoms from infection vary from none to fever, cough, headache, shortness of breath, and confusion. This may worsen into a coma over a day or two, and 50 to 75% of those infected die. Management is restricted to supportive care; there is neither vaccine nor specific treatment. As of May 2018 about 700 human cases of Nipah virus were estimated to have occurred, and 50 to 75 percent of those infected died. The disease was first identified in 1998 by a team of researchers at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya during an outbreak in Malaysia. The majority of the patients in Malaysia diagnosed with the disease were referred to and treated at the University of Malaya Medical Centre. The virus was isolated and identified in 1999.
