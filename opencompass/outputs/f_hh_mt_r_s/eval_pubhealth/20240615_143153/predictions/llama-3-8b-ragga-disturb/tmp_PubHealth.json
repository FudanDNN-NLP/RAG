The symptoms often can be attributed to other conditions if the Chiari hasn’t been found yet. Matthew’s communication skills were so severely affected by his Chiari that at age 3, he was only speaking about three words. That led to a lot of frustration — for both him and us.

Whether you’ve just received a Chiari diagnosis or are a seasoned veteran, here are some things I’ve learned along the way that may help you better cope with this condition. Research Chiari, but not so much that you frighten yourself. Talk to your doctor about where to find reliable information. Educating yourself can help you understand your child more and learn what to expect. Talk to caregivers who are experienced with the condition and parents with Chiari kids. Participate in a Chiari walk. He was frustrated because he didn’t understand why he was in pain. You might find yourself questioning everything. I’m constantly asking myself questions: “Should I be doing more now to set him up later in life?” “Am I being overprotective?” “Am I letting him do too much?” It helps to get to a place where you’re doing what you know is best for your child but you’re also allowing them some freedom. For me, finding that balance has taken a lot of trial and error. Steer your child toward what he can do rather than focusing on what he can’t. Be encouraging. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Take some time to do something special with your kids who don’t have Chiari. Educate the adults in your child’s life. But, for his safety, I have conversations with his coaches and teachers so they know what to expect. They need to understand why he’ll sometimes miss school, or why he can’t participate in certain activities. Every child with Chiari is different. No matter what stories you’ve heard, yours might be different. Stay positive. If something doesn’t feel right, question it. Don’t be too afraid to ask for help, and don’t be too proud to accept it. Chiari malformation can present a lot of struggles. I loved your article. My daughter needs the surgery and she is a senior and I am so scaried and she has been missing alot of school or being sent home from school from this. I do not know what to do because I am know at this and she likes to swim but I heard she can not dive into the water and she was on a swim team. Life can be lived (and should be lived) to its fullest as long as you don't over do things and respect your limitations. Your daughter can grow up and have a family and a wonderful life... with restrictions, but wonderful just the same. That is the best way to help.

I wish you well, and appreciate your wisdom! As is your Uncle. Thank you Cincinnati Children's for giving us a voice and bringing awareness to Chiari Malformation. I'd never heard of Chiari malformation before reading this article. I can only imagine how frustrating it would be as a parent to know there's something wrong but not know what it is. They are some really useful tips, even for other conditions as well. My son's surgery is scheduled for two days from now and I was looking for someone with a positive and uplifting message regarding Chiari.

Needless to say, our family doctor sent a referral to Duke. Finally, a great article and advice about one of our son's conditions! It brought tears of relief to read of another family's experience. Noah was symptomatic for years between having the Chiari malformation and the hydrocephalus. Speech delays, balance issues, weakness in his muscles, all the time believing it was taking him way to long to catch up from his prematurity. He thought it was normal to have excruciating pain when you sneezed, things like that. I hope this article helps another family to discover this condition before their child has to suffer for years. Like everyone with Chiari, Noah will never be able to play football or wrestling or do other activities that could put him jeopardy. And it is a constant struggle to find the balance of risk vs normality. Adding a shunt for hydro is another complication. Education is key, as is support for the entire family. Siblings suffer, too, just in different ways. My hope is that more people understand Chiari Malformation. There is a treatment. And that means there is always hope!

The problem is contributing to the alarming trend of white Americans dying younger than they used to. The rise was driven by drug overdoses and suicides, but also by alcohol poisoning, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. But when it comes to tackling alcohol misuse in middle age, the route for public health strategists has been less clear. Part of the dilemma is that, unlike opioids such as heroin, alcohol is a legal product that studies suggest can contribute to better heart health. Restrictions also can affect people who drink moderately. “There is a concerted effort among folks in the public health industry and in the government to demonize alcohol,” said Sarah Longwell, managing director of the American Beverage Institute, a trade group that represents restaurants. For instance, long-held beliefs about the benefits of moderate drinking are becoming muddled. Public health officials in other countries increasingly are warning that alcohol is a risk factor for cancer. While the latest U.S. dietary guidelines state moderate alcohol use can be part of a healthy diet, they no longer tie it to cardiovascular benefits. To the industry, these proposals represented an anti-alcohol approach that would affect people who drink moderately. Various members of the public health community believe that restrictions on alcohol are an important tool for reducing alcohol-related deaths. Yet advocates are concerned that a war on alcohol could actually make the problem worse, while creating disadvantages for casual drinkers. U.S. dietary guidelines still say that moderate drinking for those of legal drinking age means up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. “For those who choose to drink, moderate alcohol consumption can be incorporated into the calorie limits of most healthy eating patterns,” the guidelines say. But data suggest some Americans are struggling to follow these recommendations. A 2015 report stunned researchers when it revealed that most alcohol poisoning deaths are concentrated among middle-aged white men, not college students, as they had expected. County-by-county data compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that even though the percentage of people who drink alcohol has remained relatively unchanged, those who drink are more likely to be heavy drinkers and binge drinkers. The data show that women saw a 17.5 percent rise from 2005 to 2012 in binge drinking, which is defined as at least four drinks on a single occasion, such as over dinner or at a party, at least once during the last month. For men, the rates increased by 4.9 percent during the same time period. But complicating the conversation around what approach to take is that experts admit the mortality and drinking data from various sources are imperfect. “There are areas that, if we improve our measurement, we can learn better,” said Ralph Hingson, director of the division of epidemiology and prevention research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. For instance, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health data show a slight rise in binge drinking among women, but also notes that changes in the methodology have occurred that make it difficult to compare with previous years.And with alcohol misuse, the evidence for chronic illness is less clear-cut than when injuries are involved, Hingson points out. For instance, a car accident involving alcohol offers clear evidence of harm, but with cancer or obesity, the cause could involve a variety of other factors. It’s unclear what is driving the mortality trend. They noted as well that deaths were increasing primarily among people who have a high school degree or less education. The greater the availability of alcohol, they say, the more consumption will increase. He cited the example of the United Kingdom, which has one of the highest rates of binge drinking in the world. Several studies and health officials in the United Kingdom attribute this to the deregulation of alcohol: It can be sold at any time of day, it is inexpensive, and it is sold in many places. But a United Kingdom analysis of the law that extended hours during which alcohol could be sold determined that findings were generally inconclusive, and government reports on drinking rates show a small decline in binge drinking in recent years as well as an increase in the proportion of people who don’t drink at all. The Distilled Spirits Council, for instance, supports CDC guidance that directs more doctors to talk to their patients about their drinking patterns. In a recent report, the CDC found that among people who binge drink 10 or more times a month, only one in three has ever had a health professional speak with them about alcohol use. The CDC did not recommend that physicians encourage patients not to drink, but that they help patients with problem drinking habits set realistic goals. “That is probably the most significant attack on moderate drinking,” Longwell said, noting the repercussions that could come from testing positive at such a low level: fines, possible jail time and a reputational hit that could harm employment. On a global scale, the issue is getting more attention, particularly in Europe, where citizens consume more alcohol than anywhere else in the world. The World Health Organization, in response to the high rates of morbidity and mortality related to alcohol, has been recommending various strategies to curb alcohol-reated harm, some of which involve restrictions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the beverages are regularly consumed by 31 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds and 34 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds. Research \n\n High rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those with alcoholism. But recent research has concluded that, while this may be true in some cases, alcohol misuse directly causes the development of depression in a significant number of heavy drinkers. It is usually possible to differentiate between alcohol-related depression and depression that is not related to alcohol intake by taking a careful history of the patient. These opinions generally lead to the argument that it is far more effective and beneficial for laws to monitor, limit, and guide healthy drinking habits rather than to outright ban it.

Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications. Signs and symptoms\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission\n\nVirology\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. Immunopathology\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors\n\nVirus proteins\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine response\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon. Pregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:\n Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Diagnosis\n\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testing\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Imaging\n\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%). The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that \"Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.\" Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. Treatment\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. Children\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Longer-term effects\n\nSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. Immunity\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. Reinfection with COVID‑19 is possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US. Infection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. On 2July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. Comorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. History\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered. The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. , Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. Misinformation\n\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online. Other species\n\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. , hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. , more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far. Treatment-related research\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. Cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is undergoing a PhaseII non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade\nThere was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu.

On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March.

The study also estimates the risk level to health workers, compared with the general public. Using data from the app, researchers were able to identify six distinct types of COVID-19 and forecast which initial symptoms were more likely to lead to severe illnesses.

        "context": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications. Signs and symptoms\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission\n\nVirology\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. Immunopathology\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors\n\nVirus proteins\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine response\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon. Pregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:\n Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Diagnosis\n\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testing\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Imaging\n\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%). The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that \"Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.\" Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. Treatment\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. Children\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Longer-term effects\n\nSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. Immunity\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. Reinfection with COVID‑19 is possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US. Infection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. On 2July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. Comorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. History\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered. The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. , Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. Misinformation\n\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online. Other species\n\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. , hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. , more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far. Treatment-related research\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. Cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is undergoing a PhaseII non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade\nThere was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu.

The study also estimates the risk level to health workers, compared with the general public. Using data from the app, researchers were able to identify six distinct types of COVID-19 and forecast which initial symptoms were more likely to lead to severe illnesses. The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.\n\n"

The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty\nBased on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil \nDespite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.\n\nEfficacy and clinical trials\nIn 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects\nLY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development\nIn August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\".

Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.\nAmicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. [Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty\nBased on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil \nDespite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.\n\nEfficacy and clinical trials\nIn 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects\nLY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development\nIn August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\". In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": "Eli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials. The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients.

Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.\nAmicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. [Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley.

CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. HHS is in constant communication with state health officials and hospital administrators to monitor stress on the health care system and to prepare for the possibility that federal medical assets will be necessary to supplement state and local surge capabilities. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. These groups are: pregnant women; people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age; health care and emergency services personnel; persons between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; and people from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for severe disease because of chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes, or compromised immune systems. In addition, ACIP recommended that local public health authorities may want to prioritize a smaller group of people while supplies are limited, in which case the following groups who are at the highest risk for infection or severe illness should receive the vaccine before others: pregnant women, people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency medical services personnel with direct patient contact, children 6 months through 4 years of age, and children 5 through 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions. So far the reports of adverse events among H1N1 vaccination are generally mild and are similar to those we see with seasonal flu vaccine. CDC and FDA have been working to enhance surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events among vaccinated persons and to adjust the vaccination program to minimize these risks. These systems are designed to determine whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate than among unvaccinated persons. In the spring, anticipating commercial market constraints, HHS deployed 11 million courses of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ensure the nation was positioned to quickly employ these drugs to combat 2009 H1N1 and its spread. In early October, HHS shipped an additional 300,000 bottles of the oral suspension formulation of the antiviral oseltamivir to states in order to mitigate a predicted near-term national shortage indicated by commercial supply data. Finally, CDC and FDA have also worked together to address potential options for treatment of seriously ill hospitalized patients with influenza, including situations in which physicians may wish to use investigational formulations of antiviral drugs for intravenous therapy. There have been enormous efforts in the United States and abroad to prepare for this kind of challenge. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide. Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it. This includes Germany who limited it to people over age 60 and France who limited it to people over \n\n had to protect myself against a real possible danger of infection by a person returning from a virus-contaminated area, entering and leaving my home and thus endangering my health and the health of my visitors\". The student reportedly informed Scharnitzky in January of her intentions to visit China, though this trip never took place. On 5 February 2020, a Chinese woman in Berlin, who had not visited China in three months, was reportedly turned away by her gynecologist, claiming the coronavirus may infect pregnant women in the clinic. In the same month, a Chinese student in Essen with a sore throat was denied an appointment by a general practitioner over coronavirus fears, despite not having been to China since September 2019. For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general. As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion. • The flu is devastating to the old and young. • Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. • Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? Experience is the best teacher. THMCC has more than 22 years of experience gained from caring for millions of patients. Deutsche Welle describes ITN as a party that could \"turn anti-vax into state policy\", stating that the party's parliamentary head, Toshko Yordanov, had supported and spread anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in parliament by claiming that vaccines do not reduce COVID-19 transmission. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented \"discrimination\" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition.

        "context": "Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, M.D. Working together with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, state and local health departments, the medical community and our private sector partners, we have been monitoring the spread of H1N1 and facilitating prevention and treatment, including implementing a vaccination program. CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. HHS is in constant communication with state health officials and hospital administrators to monitor stress on the health care system and to prepare for the possibility that federal medical assets will be necessary to supplement state and local surge capabilities. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. These groups are: pregnant women; people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age; health care and emergency services personnel; persons between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; and people from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for severe disease because of chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes, or compromised immune systems. In addition, ACIP recommended that local public health authorities may want to prioritize a smaller group of people while supplies are limited, in which case the following groups who are at the highest risk for infection or severe illness should receive the vaccine before others: pregnant women, people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency medical services personnel with direct patient contact, children 6 months through 4 years of age, and children 5 through 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions. So far the reports of adverse events among H1N1 vaccination are generally mild and are similar to those we see with seasonal flu vaccine. CDC and FDA have been working to enhance surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events among vaccinated persons and to adjust the vaccination program to minimize these risks. These systems are designed to determine whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate than among unvaccinated persons. In the spring, anticipating commercial market constraints, HHS deployed 11 million courses of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ensure the nation was positioned to quickly employ these drugs to combat 2009 H1N1 and its spread. In early October, HHS shipped an additional 300,000 bottles of the oral suspension formulation of the antiviral oseltamivir to states in order to mitigate a predicted near-term national shortage indicated by commercial supply data. Finally, CDC and FDA have also worked together to address potential options for treatment of seriously ill hospitalized patients with influenza, including situations in which physicians may wish to use investigational formulations of antiviral drugs for intravenous therapy. There have been enormous efforts in the United States and abroad to prepare for this kind of challenge. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide. Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it. This includes Germany who limited it to people over age 60 and France who limited it to people over \n\n had to protect myself against a real possible danger of infection by a person returning from a virus-contaminated area, entering and leaving my home and thus endangering my health and the health of my visitors\". The student reportedly informed Scharnitzky in January of her intentions to visit China, though this trip never took place. On 5 February 2020, a Chinese woman in Berlin, who had not visited China in three months, was reportedly turned away by her gynecologist, claiming the coronavirus may infect pregnant women in the clinic. In the same month, a Chinese student in Essen with a sore throat was denied an appointment by a general practitioner over coronavirus fears, despite not having been to China since September 2019. For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general. As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion. • The flu is devastating to the old and young. • Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. • Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? Experience is the best teacher. THMCC has more than 22 years of experience gained from caring for millions of patients. Deutsche Welle describes ITN as a party that could \"turn anti-vax into state policy\", stating that the party's parliamentary head, Toshko Yordanov, had supported and spread anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in parliament by claiming that vaccines do not reduce COVID-19 transmission. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented \"discrimination\" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests.\n\n"

Our study shows that chemotherapy may be avoided in about 70 percent of these women when its use is guided by the test, thus limiting chemotherapy to the 30 percent who we can predict will benefit from it,” said lead author Joseph A. Sparano, MD, Associate Director for Clinical Research at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center and Montefiore Health System in New York City. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended, but the benefit is small, in about 3-5 percent of patients, he said. “Most patients are over-treated, and estrogen therapy alone is adequate. Some are under-treated and some who did not receive chemotherapy could have benefited,” said Sparano. These women should consider chemotherapy with their doctor, he said. ASCO Expert Harold Burstein, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, commented: “These data provide critical reassurance to doctors and patients that they can use genomic information to make better treatment decisions in women with early-stage breast cancer. Practically speaking, this means that thousands of women will be able to avoid chemotherapy, with all of its side effects, while still achieving excellent long-term outcomes. of cells to excrete compounds, permeability of the blood–brain barrier, damage done to DNA including shortening of telomeres and cellular oxidative stress. Fifty-six of the 132 chemotherapy agents approved by the FDA \n\n tend to derive minimal benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and so it may be appropriate to choose to avoid side effects from that additional treatment. As an additional example, a neoadjuvant clinical treatment program that included initial chemotherapy followed by surgery and subsequent additional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy found a strong correlation of the Oncotype classification with the likelihood of a complete response (CR) to the presurgical chemotherapy. Results from both the US and internationally suggest that Oncotype may assist in treatment decisions. This type of anaplastic glioma has a more favorable outcome than other types of anaplastic glioma. Standard therapy at this point in time is surgery followed by radiation therapy. Survival will also be monitored in the people getting temozolomide alone. These two drugs may prevent two of the main switch pathways in the tumor cells from working properly, which hopefully might prevent the cells from growing. An investigational drug is one which has not been approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drugs are approved for use in other conditions. However, treatment with bevacizumab alone has only modestly improved overall survival in patients with this type of brain tumor. \"A Randomized Phase III Trial of the Value of Early Local Therapy for the Intact Primary Tumor in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer\"\nPurpose: The standard treatment for metastatic breast cancer is the use of chemotherapy, anti-hormone pills, or other medication. When the cancer is no longer only in the breast and has spread to other areas of the body, surgery and/or radiation for the tumor in the breast cannot control the other areas of the cancer and are only used if the breast tumor is causing skin breakdown or pain, which happens only in some patients. For most people, the tumor in the breast is controlled with medicine and does not cause problems. We do not know if local treatment (surgery and/or radiation) used early in the course of treatment of the breast cancer will help patients with metastatic breast cancer live longer or not. The purpose of this study is to compare the good and bad effects of a new approach that includes surgery plus radiation for the breast tumor to the standard approach of continued treatment with the medication which is working to control the tumor. Patients who receive the standard treatment, but the medicine is no longer controlling the tumor in the breast, and the doctor feels surgery or radiation is needed, patients may receive this. \"A Phase III Clinical Trial Comparing Trastuzumab Given Concurrently with Radiation Therapy and Radiation Therapy Alone for Women with HER2-Positive Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Resected by Lumpectomy\"\nPurpose: This study is being done to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of adding the drug trastuzumab (also called Herceptin®) to breast radiation therapy. This can turn a normal cell into a cancer cell and can cause cancer cells to grow faster. Also, there is early information that suggests trastuzumab may be a “radiosensitizer”. This means that trastuzumab may help radiation therapy work better in HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab is a standard treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. Investigational means that trastuzumab has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use. • Another goal of this study is to find out how the study drugs used in this study affect menstrual cycles (monthly periods) and if these changes in menstrual cycles have any effect on breast cancer. As part of this study goal, blood samples will be collected. • This study will also explore the possibility that other medical conditions, medications the patient may be taking, or other factors such as alcohol intake, smoking, and weight may affect breast cancer. Chemotherapy and other therapy after surgery will decrease the chance of this cancer returning. All of these drugs are used in standard combinations of chemotherapy for breast cancer. The researchers also want to learn about the side effects of the combinations of drugs used in this study. Side effect information will also be studied to see if there are any differences between the two-drug and three-drug chemotherapy combinations. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good or bad, of trastuzumab emtansine versus trastuzumab (Herceptin®) on breast cancer to find out which is better. In this study, participants will get either trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab alone. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Currently most women who have this kind of breast cancer are treated with endocrine therapy (treatment that works with hormones). No one really knows which patients with lower Recurrence Scores need to get chemotherapy. Some women may be getting chemotherapy who do not need it. The current standard treatment after chemotherapy is hormone treatment alone. It is considered investigational for breast cancer patients. The combination of hormone-treatment and everolimus is experimental in patients with breast cancer. GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER STUDIES -- No studies at this time. The study will also assess whether diet or lifestyle predicts how well men do overall with this type of cancer. \"Androgen Deprivation Therapy and High Dose Radiotherapy With or Without Whole-Pelvic Radiotherapy in Unfavorable Intermediate or Favorable High Risk Prostate Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Trial\"\nThe purpose of this study is to see if paclitaxel and carboplatin (chemotherapy drugs) plus AMG 386, followed by 18 months of AMG 386 after the chemotherapy, will have an improved outcome compared to paclitaxel and carboplatin plus AMG 386 placebo followed by 18 months of AMG 386 placebo after the chemotherapy. AMG 386 is considered experimental (or investigational). Therefore, AMG 386 is not approved to treat subjects who have been diagnosed with recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. \"A Phase III Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Alone r in Combination with Bevacizumab (NSC #704865, IND #7921) Followed by Bevacizumab and Secondary Cytoreductive Surgery in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian, Peritoneal Primary and Fallopian Tube Cancer\"\nPURPOSE: One purpose of this study is to compare the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab to the standard combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. Effectiveness of treatment will be measured in terms of survival, time without evidence of cancer growth and quality of life (wellness and physical functioning). If the study doctors feel that their patients are good candidates for the second surgery they will be randomized to have surgery or not and at the same time they will be randomized to receive one of the two possible chemotherapy combinations. If they are not eligible for surgery they can still be randomized to receive chemotherapy. If participants are randomized to receive the surgery it will be performed before they are given chemotherapy. Patients with endometrial cancer have been treated with radiation and chemotherapy. It is not clear whether giving chemotherapy alone or together with radiation is the best treatment. The current study will compare the effects of two treatments in subjects with endometrial cancer. One treatment which is considered investigational consists of cisplatin given together with radiation therapy followed by the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles. Another treatment, the current standard therapy, consists of carboplatin and paclitaxel given for 6 cycles without radiation therapy. This study will compare survival of subjects and side effects receiving these two study treatments. Participants will be given only one of these study treatments. -- No studies at this time. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of cetuximab on lung cancer, in combination with other chemotherapy. The participant will be “randomly assigned” to receive either chemotherapy without cetuximab or chemotherapy with cetuximab. However, this information is available to the study doctor if needed in an emergency. The participant will have an equal chance of being placed in either group to receive cetuximab or not (Groups 3 and 4 for cetuximab). -- No studies at this time. Although all of the agents used in this study are FDA approved, the purpose of the study is to give more intensive treatment to patients whose PET/CT scan shows that they are at a greater chance of still having active lymphoma, and to give less intensive treatment to subjects whose PET/CT scan shows that they have a smaller chance of still having active lymphoma. In this way, we hope to improve the cure rate for all patients while decreasing the side effects of the treatment. Bisphosphonates are sometimes given to patients who have cancer that has spread to their bones because it can lower the chances of getting fractures and reduces bone pain. There is concern about the association of ONJ with bisphosphonate therapy. Purpose: many cancer patients report mild to moderate cognitive difficulties (such as problems remembering things, multi-tasking, or concentrating) during and following treatment of their cancer and currently we do not have very good treatments for these difficulties. We believe that cognitive difficulties associated with cancer and chemotherapy treatments may be related to increased inflammation and other processes that can impact inflammation in the body; inflammation and inflammation-related processes are associated with cognitive difficulties in other diseases, and the same may be true for cancer and cognition. Advances in the use of blood tests to detect recurrences, insight into how to treat early breast cancer, and extending survival for late-stage lung cancer patients were among the highlights of this year’s ASTRO meeting in San Antonio. The news that radiation to lymph nodes is effective for some prostate cancer patients was among the highlights to come out of ASTRO. Why it matters: Liquid biopsy tests have the potential to save money by reducing the need for radiological imaging, such as CT scans, to check for cancer recurrence. After 12 years of follow-up, the study found that all DCIS patients had very low rates of cancer recurrence, but the rates were lowest among women who had whole breast radiation therapy and those who chose to take the medication tamoxifen. Radiation reduced the recurrence risk by half. Other patients, she says, are concerned about that risk and may want to do everything possible to lower it. The patients had received systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or targeted medications. Some patients also had surgery or radiation. The patients who received the additional treatment survived without the cancer progressing for an average of 14.2 months compared with 4.4 months for those patients who received the standard treatment. Why it matters: The survival time of 14.2 months is considered long for patients with such a severe disease and poor prognosis, the authors noted. The study suggests that stage 4 patients who have limited metastasis (the cancer has spread to only one to three other sites) may benefit from more aggressive treatment. Studies are ongoing to see if other treatment combinations, including immunotherapy, may further extend survival in these patients. What’s new: A combination of radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy produces the best outcomes for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) related head and neck cancer, according to a phase 3 study presented October 22 at ASTRO. The study explored whether a combination of Erbitux (cetuximab), a drug used to treat head and neck cancers, and radiation would be less toxic than the combination of radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy — but without affecting survival rates. The study of 805 patients found a survival benefit to patients in the chemotherapy arm of the trial. The patients in the cisplatin group experienced slightly more serious side effects than those treated with Erbitux (82 percent compared with 77 percent). The study should help clarify treatment for this subset of patients, said Neha Vapiwala, MD, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study. “We have struggled with the question of do you treat the lymph nodes,” she said. The new study analyzed eight additional years of follow-up and also found that moderate or severe side effects were low in all three groups, including women who received once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy. Why it matters: Guidelines issued by ASTRO earlier this year recommended hypofractionated therapy for breast cancer patients regardless of age, tumor stage, and whether they had received chemotherapy. But according to the authors, many patients are not offered it. The Mayo Clinic research team studied 518 patients who received either a technique called hippocampal-avoidance radiation or traditional whole-brain radiation. The two groups had similar cancer control and overall survival. Why it matters: Whole-brain radiation is administered to patients whose cancers have spread to the brain — as many as 200,000 cases a year in the United States, the authors said.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

We believe that cognitive difficulties associated with cancer and chemotherapy treatments may be related to increased inflammation and other processes that can impact inflammation in the body; inflammation and inflammation-related processes are associated with cognitive difficulties in other diseases, and the same may be true for cancer and cognition. Advances in the use of blood tests to detect recurrences, insight into how to treat early breast cancer, and extending survival for late-stage lung cancer patients were among the highlights of this year’s ASTRO meeting in San Antonio. The news that radiation to lymph nodes is effective for some prostate cancer patients was among the highlights to come out of ASTRO. Why it matters: Liquid biopsy tests have the potential to save money by reducing the need for radiological imaging, such as CT scans, to check for cancer recurrence. After 12 years of follow-up, the study found that all DCIS patients had very low rates of cancer recurrence, but the rates were lowest among women who had whole breast radiation therapy and those who chose to take the medication tamoxifen. Radiation reduced the recurrence risk by half. Other patients, she says, are concerned about that risk and may want to do everything possible to lower it. The patients had received systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or targeted medications. Some patients also had surgery or radiation. The patients who received the additional treatment survived without the cancer progressing for an average of 14.2 months compared with 4.4 months for those patients who received the standard treatment. Why it matters: The survival time of 14.2 months is considered long for patients with such a severe disease and poor prognosis, the authors noted. The study suggests that stage 4 patients who have limited metastasis (the cancer has spread to only one to three other sites) may benefit from more aggressive treatment. Studies are ongoing to see if other treatment combinations, including immunotherapy, may further extend survival in these patients. What’s new: A combination of radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy produces the best outcomes for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) related head and neck cancer, according to a phase 3 study presented October 22 at ASTRO. The study explored whether a combination of Erbitux (cetuximab), a drug used to treat head and neck cancers, and radiation would be less toxic than the combination of radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy — but without affecting survival rates. The study of 805 patients found a survival benefit to patients in the chemotherapy arm of the trial. The patients in the cisplatin group experienced slightly more serious side effects than those treated with Erbitux (82 percent compared with 77 percent). The study should help clarify treatment for this subset of patients, said Neha Vapiwala, MD, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study. “We have struggled with the question of do you treat the lymph nodes,” she said. The new study analyzed eight additional years of follow-up and also found that moderate or severe side effects were low in all three groups, including women who received once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy. Why it matters: Guidelines issued by ASTRO earlier this year recommended hypofractionated therapy for breast cancer patients regardless of age, tumor stage, and whether they had received chemotherapy. But according to the authors, many patients are not offered it. The Mayo Clinic research team studied 518 patients who received either a technique called hippocampal-avoidance radiation or traditional whole-brain radiation. The two groups had similar cancer control and overall survival. Why it matters: Whole-brain radiation is administered to patients whose cancers have spread to the brain — as many as 200,000 cases a year in the United States, the authors said.\n\n"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths. All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices. The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health. Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping.

However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices.

Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available. Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs. About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. The researchers found that mice that received the transplanted cells survived in greater numbers than mice with heart attacks that did not receive the mouse stem cells. In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart. It reported on a study that divided 70 cardiac patients into two equal groups: one group was injected with stem cells, and the other group received a placebo. A study looking at safety and feasibility of infusing cord blood stem cells into the hearts of babies born with a defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is nearing completion, and we have already heard of one family who is sleeping better knowing their little boy is on the road to recovery. This would normally require the patient to undergo a heart transplant later down the road, but researchers think an infusion of cord blood could solve the problem by making the right side of the heart two times to five times stronger. “And if we make it strong enough, we believe that that has a shot at delaying and preventing transplant for a significant number of these children.\" After collecting the cord blood at the time of birth, processing it in Minnesota and cryo-preserving it for three months, the cord blood stem cells were thawed and infused directly into Ryals’s heart near the end of his second operation. In 2007, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a world-famous heart surgeon based at Imperial College London, and a team of researchers developed heart valve cells with stem cells. Presenting at the American Heart Association's annual scientific sessions in New Orleans during November 2008, cardiac surgeon Dr. Ralf Sodian reported that his team had used stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood to create tissue-engineered heart valves. Stem cells collected at birth from the umbilical cord may help doctors fashion new heart valves for children born with heart valve defects. In Circulation Research, Timothy Kamp, co-director of the university's Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Center, reported that the reprogrammed heart cells made in the laboratory generated electrical pulses, and in response to these pulses, they contracted. \"If you have a heart failure patient who is in dire straits and there are never enough donor hearts for transplantation, we may be able to make heart cells from the patient's skin cells and use them to repair heart muscle. A 2014 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 1,255 participants showed a reduce risk of mortality or re-hospitalization in the long-term for patients who underwent a stem cell therapy for heart disease. As scientists have been better developing an understanding of how these stem cells are aiding heart repair, they have moved more and more towards mesenchymal stem cells as a source. Today, more and more clinical trials using stem cells like those found in cord tissue are being used to treat heart disease. As scientists gain further insight into how, when, which and to what capacity stem cells can be used to treat heart conditions through these clinical trials, we grow ever closer to potentially discovering a whole new way to mend a broken heart. the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts. Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions. They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming. Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics. Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues. In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss. Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver. At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells. The center, led by biologist Eric Olson, opened in May with a $10 million gift from the Hamon Charitable Foundation. Olson hopes the center will help UT Southwestern attract top college graduates from around the U.S.\nOlson’s career-long interest in how a single cell develops into the trillions that make up the human body led to his lab’s current work. “I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process. In the center’s inaugural publication this month in the journal Science, Olson and his colleagues outlined a way to “edit” the gene abnormalities responsible for the disorder in a mouse and rectify the body’s ability to grow healthy muscle. “I was trained as a pediatric cardiologist and was interested in how the heart forms in the embryo and how that goes awry in human disease,” says Srivastava, who now directs cardiac and stem cell research at the Gladstone Institutes and is a professor at the University of California San Francisco. The two went on to discover many of the genes that control heart development. In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients. Those ingredients, proteins known as transcription factors, are master regulators that flip genes on and off. The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb. Each group used a different combination of transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that the technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack. For the last two decades, stem cells have been virtually synonymous with regenerative medicine. Scientists use them in many different ways. In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue. In a second approach, scientists can extract stem cells from embryos and then convert them. In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells. Adult stem cells have had mixed results. So far, researchers have tried direct reprogramming in mice and in human cells in a lab dish. He starts with glial cells, which reproduce in the brain and spinal cord following an injury and can form scars. Most scientists who work on direct reprogramming are continuing their research on stem cells in parallel. Another advantage of using stem cells is that the process creates a lot more cells to work with than direct reprogramming. “Right now, if you take a dish of fibroblasts in a lab and reprogram that dish, you can get maybe 10 percent of those cells to turn into heart muscle cells, and we’d like to improve that efficiency,” says Olson. Yet direct reprogramming, says Zhang, is more akin to true regeneration. “We design a way to help the tissue repair or regenerate itself,” he says. Stem cells, by contrast, involve growing cells in a dish and then injecting them into patients. The ultimate hope with direct reprogramming is that it will lead to a drug that will stimulate patients’ bodies to heal themselves. Srivastava is testing his direct reprogramming technique in pigs, whose hearts are closer in size to those of humans. The goal is to see if he can generate enough muscle to dramatically improve the heart’s pumping ability.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The artificial systems aren't organs and they aren't transplanted inside the body, says Steven Russell, assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the study published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine. One pump delivers insulin — a hormone that lowers blood sugar — while the other delivers glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar, says Russell, whose research was presented at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions in San Francisco. Insulin and other hormones are normally made by the pancreas. In people with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease also known as juvenile diabetes, the pancreas doesn't make insulin, a hormone needed to move sugar from blood into cells, where it makes energy. \"Diabetes is relentless. Most people with type 1 diabetes today repeatedly prick their fingers to test their blood sugar, then calculate exactly how much insulin to inject to keep their levels in the healthy range, Damiano says. About one-third of diabetics use insulin pumps, instead of giving themselves injections. People still need to manually compute how much insulin they need, Russell says. In the new study, involving 20 adults and 32 adolescents, doctors compared patients' blood sugar using the pump for five days, with their levels for five days using the bionic pancreas, which provides round-the-clock glucose monitoring. Among adults, glucose levels using the bionic pancreas averaged 133, compared with 159 on the pump, the study says. Adults had low glucose levels about 4.1% of the time spent on the bionic pancreas, compared with 7.3% of the time using the pump. Among adolescents, blood sugar levels averaged 138 on the bionic pancreas and 157 with the pump, according to the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health. The amount of time with low blood sugars was about the same, whether relying on the pump or bionic pancreas. \"This is a very significant and very exciting new advance,\" says endocrinologist Betul Hatipoglu, who treats diabetes at the Cleveland Clinic but who wasn't involved in the new study. But Samuel Dagogo-Jack, president-elect for science and medicine at the American Diabetes Association, cautions that the study was small and lasted only five days. The team is working on a system that will include a single pump capable of providing both hormones. This shows promise for the use of melanopsin as an optogenetic tool for the treatment of Type II diabetes. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. Islets are usually infused into the person's liver. To prevent this immunosuppressant drugs are used. For an average-size person (70 kg), a typical transplant requires about one million islets, isolated from two donor pancreases. Because good control of blood glucose can slow or prevent the progression of complications associated with diabetes, such as nerve or eye damage, a successful transplant may reduce the risk of these complications. Notably, the Cambridge study showed that the children and teenagers spent twice as much time during the night within targeted blood glucose levels when their diabetes was regulated with the artificial pancreas system than when they followed conventional “manual” therapy. And low blood sugars were minimized. During control nights, the subject’s standard insulin pump settings were applied. but that the fear of low blood sugar emergencies often prevents many people from achieving tight control, and remains a constant concern for those who manage their diabetes well. These academic studies within the Artificial Pancreas Project are an excellent complement, and essential to JDRF’s work with industry participants to develop first ?generation systems. The goal of an artificial pancreas has also been embraced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which along with JDRF and National Institutes of Health, brought together scientists, regulators, industry, and patients for scientific workshops n the subject in 2005 and 2008; the FDA has designated an artificial pancreas as one of its “critical path” initiatives. An artificial pancreas would measure blood sugar through a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which continuously reads the glucose levels through a hair-thin tube inserted just below the skin, typically on the stomach. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes children and adults suddenly, and can be fatal.

Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

Treatment of acute patellar dislocation. Am J Sports Med 1988;16(3):244-249. While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. Complication rates are between 15 - 30%, with long term issues such as graft osteolysis continuing to be an issue \n\n Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206. J Orthop Trauma 2000; 14: 36-40. Xuhui L.

        "context": "Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.

The combination is sometimes described as an \"angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor\" (ARNi). Structure activity relationship \nSacubitril is the molecule that is metabolically activated by de-ethylation by esterases. The active form of the molecule, Sacubitrilat, is responsible for the molecule's drug lowering effects. Medical uses\nSacubitril/valsartan can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), alongside other standard therapies (e.g. To investigate its use for heart failure in those with a preserved LVEF (HFpEF), Novartis funded the PARAGON-HF trial which was designed to investigate the use of sacubatril/valsartan in the treatment of HFpEF patients with a LVEF of 45% or more. Concluding in 2019, it failed to show significance for reducing hospitalisation related to heart failure or reducing death from cardiovascular causes, and therefore appearing to show limited benefit to those with HFpEF. Patients who exhibit symptoms of NYHA Class II or III heart failure and are still symptomatic despite maximally tolerated dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB alone, may be considered for sacubitril/valsartan dual therapy to decrease the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality. Mortality benefits have only been observed to date in those with LVEF less than 35%. Changing 100 people from an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist to sacubitril/valsartan for 2.3 years would prevent three deaths, five hospitalizations for heart failure, and eleven hospitalizations overall. History\nDuring its development by Novartis, Entresto was known as LCZ696. It was also approved in Europe in 2015. For example, both Richard Lehman, a physician who writes a weekly review of key medical articles for the BMJ Blog and a December 2015, report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) found that the risk–benefit ratio was not adequately determined because the design of the clinical trial was too artificial and did not reflect people with heart failure that doctors usually encounter. In 2019, the PIONEER-HF and PARAGON-HF trials studied the effect of sacubitril/valsartan in 800 patients recently hospitalised with severe heart failure and 4800 patients with less severe symptoms of heart failure respectively. The medication consistently demonstrated similar levels of safety, with higher rates of very low blood pressure, compared to current treatments across all three trials in a variety of patients, however it has only shown effectiveness in those with more advanced heart failure. In December 2015, Steven Nissen and other thought leaders in cardiology said that the approval of sacubitril/valsartan had the greatest impact on clinical practice in cardiology in 2015, and Nissen called the drug \"a truly a breakthrough approach.\" Another 2015 review called the reductions in mortality and hospitalization conferred by sacubitril/valsartan \"striking\", but noted that its effects in heart failure people with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and the elderly needed to be evaluated further. Similar class generic drugs without sacubitril, such as valsartan alone, cost approximately  a year. Research\nThe PARADIGM-HF trial (in which Milton Packer was one of the principal investigators) compared treatment with sacubitril/valsartan to treatment with enalapril. People with heart failure and reduced LVEF (10,513) were sequentially treated on a short-term basis with enalapril and then with sacubitril/valsartan. Those that were able to tolerate both regimens (8442, 80%) were randomly assigned to long-term treatment with either enalapril or sacubitril/valsartan. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis revealed a reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure in the sacubitril/valsartan group relative to those treated with enalapril. Additionally the trial compared a maximal dose of valsartan (plus sacubitril) with a sub-maximal dose of enalapril, and was thus not directly comparable with current gold-standard use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure, diminishing the validity of the trial results.

A subgroup analysis in heart failure patients with diabetes from the ATMOSPHERE trial has failed to show benefit and signals the end of the road for aliskiren in heart failure. The findings were presented for the first time today in a late breaking trial session at Heart Failure 2016 and the 3rd World Congress on Acute Heart Failure. \"This was a subgroup analysis with the inherent limitations of this type of study. It failed to show superiority or non-inferiority of aliskiren over the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in heart failure patients with diabetes,\" said principal investigator Professor Lars Kober, a consultant cardiologist at Rigshospitalet - Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. We will never know, as the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 has since emerged and bypassed the need for aliskiren.\" The Aliskiren Trial of Minimizing OutcomeS for Patients with HEart failure (ATMOSPHERE) included 7016 patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, of whom 2340 were randomly assigned to enalapril plus aliskiren, 2340 to aliskiren, and 2316 to enalapril. Following the results of two separate trials, the EMA requested the withdrawal of all patients with diabetes from ATMOSPHERE. The Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) had found a tendency towards harm in patients with diabetes. Other adverse events were evenly distributed. Professor Kober said: \"Aliskiren monotherapy looked promising in heart failure patients with diabetes, with an 18% almost significant reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation compared to enalapril. This suggests that aliskiren could be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor.\" Professor Kober said: \"We did a rigorous trial which should have shown that aliskiren is as good as an ACE inhibitor. The drug was never given the chance to demonstrate how good it is because of regulatory interference. That will never be tested now. This could have been a major problem for patients if the neprilysin inhibitor had not emerged.\" Aliskiren fails to show benefit for heart failure patients with diabetes: A subgroup analysis in heart failure patients with diabetes from the ATMOSPHERE trial has failed to show benefit and signals the end of the road for aliskiren in heart failure.

A subgroup analysis in heart failure patients with diabetes from the ATMOSPHERE trial has failed to show benefit and signals the end of the road for aliskiren in heart failure. The findings were presented for the first time today in a late breaking trial session at Heart Failure 2016 and the 3rd World Congress on Acute Heart Failure. \"This was a subgroup analysis with the inherent limitations of this type of study. It failed to show superiority or non-inferiority of aliskiren over the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in heart failure patients with diabetes,\" said principal investigator Professor Lars Kober, a consultant cardiologist at Rigshospitalet - Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. We will never know, as the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 has since emerged and bypassed the need for aliskiren.\" The Aliskiren Trial of Minimizing OutcomeS for Patients with HEart failure (ATMOSPHERE) included 7016 patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, of whom 2340 were randomly assigned to enalapril plus aliskiren, 2340 to aliskiren, and 2316 to enalapril. Following the results of two separate trials, the EMA requested the withdrawal of all patients with diabetes from ATMOSPHERE. The Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) had found a tendency towards harm in patients with diabetes. Other adverse events were evenly distributed. Professor Kober said: \"Aliskiren monotherapy looked promising in heart failure patients with diabetes, with an 18% almost significant reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation compared to enalapril. This suggests that aliskiren could be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor.\" Professor Kober said: \"We did a rigorous trial which should have shown that aliskiren is as good as an ACE inhibitor. The drug was never given the chance to demonstrate how good it is because of regulatory interference. That will never be tested now. This could have been a major problem for patients if the neprilysin inhibitor had not emerged.\" Aliskiren fails to show benefit for heart failure patients with diabetes: A subgroup analysis in heart failure patients with diabetes from the ATMOSPHERE trial has failed to show benefit and signals the end of the road for aliskiren in heart failure.

These tasks can include mechanical ones, such as pulling wheelchairs, reminding individuals to take their medication, or even interrupting self-mutilation of an individual with a dissociative personality disorder. Conversely, ESAs, which also include therapy dogs, do not fall under the category of service animals. They can be used as part of a medical treatment plan for a patient, providing companionship, but they do not have special training to perform specific tasks. ESAs can be prescribed for those with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, to name a few invisible disabilities. Ultimately, the biggest difference between the two types of animals is training, or lack thereof. And yet, this difference plays a significant role in the acceptance of both animal types as supports for those suffering from mental health issues. One of the biggest controversies between the two kinds of animals exists in air travel rules and regulations. One of the most infamous stories happened in 2014, when a woman attempted to bring her 70-lb emotional support pig onto a flight with her. This is just one manifestation of one of the biggest problems with ESAs: Due to the lack of clear understanding of an ESA’s role, passengers who are traveling with normal pets (i.e., non-ESAs) have taken advantage of this designation, in order for their pet to fly for free. However, if illegitimate, an untrained animal could not only pose a physical danger to other passengers, but could also depict legitimate ESAs in a bad light–unfairly affecting individuals who use their animals appropriately and truly suffer from mental disorders. Conversely, ESAs are not required to have training, and the same regulations for service animals do not apply to them as they are under a different, more flexible designation. By claiming an animal is an ESA, airlines may allow the animal to not only fly for free, but to fly in cabin as well. For example, medical documentation less than a year old must be provided for ESAs and service animals must be wearing identifying equipment. Yet, ESAs are still easily exploited by passengers. As of now, passengers can complete any free online questionnaire or falsify information over a phone conversation, thereby garnering some sort of evidence that they need an ESA. While the ADA specifies that animals may be used for disabilities but not emotional support, the Air Carrier Access Act’s definition does allow animals for individuals who need them for emotional support. This would reassure airlines of the legitimacy of an animal, and could also act as a learning point for the rest of the passengers and members of public. Ultimately, for the sake of those who appropriately use these animals, and for the health and safety of fellow travellers, a better understanding of these animals, their roles, and their handlers, should become common practice. And perhaps one day, trained pigs will be allowed to fly once again. Allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety, so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. The USDA has increased enforcement of the law in recent years, targeting magicians who perform magic tricks with rabbits. In 2013, the USDA found that China Southern Airlines had improperly transported over a thousand monkeys without federal permission in insecure crates. For those who are unaware of the concept of an emotional support animal and the contribution it has in an individual’s life should know that it is a trained pet that provides therapeutic benefits to a person with mental and emotional disability. These pets are trained extensively, lead a strict but loved life and take care of their owners in a way no human can. With the amazing contribution of these animals in the life of a person, various laws have been formulated to accommodate these animals in places they are generally not allowed, such as in restaurants and airplanes. These pets sometimes referred to as comfort animals, companion animals or therapy animals are generally the household pets with no specific formalities.

Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative. The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively. Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own. These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths. There is a high stigma against mental illness. Suicide is a problem in Indonesia and in 2018 ranks 65 with 2.9 suicides per 100,000. Suicides are often unreported due to stigma, approximately 10,000 people commit suicide per year.

The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. LHRH antagonists. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped. Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small \n\n Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism affects information processing in \n\nJune 17 2017 by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. \"We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia,\" said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish \"bricks\" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. \"Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain.\" My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora.

This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism. Pediatrics. Core symptoms of autism improved after vitamin d supplementation. This report is one case study of a 3 year old boy who improved after vitamn D supplementation. Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento, and her team report, \"Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome.\" In a 4-week study, 18 children, ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, with autistic spectrum disorder and/or fragile X syndrome were given either 3 mg melatonin or placebo each night for 2 weeks. The children then \"crossed over\" to the other treatment group for 2 weeks. The main feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Sleep problems are reported in the vast majority of children with autism and fragile X syndrome. The syndrome affects 2 to 4 percent of those with autism spectrum disorder, and symptoms of autism are common in children with fragile X. Having a parent or a mother with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia increases a child's risk of having autism. Low birth weight and preterm delivery are a cause. Advanced parental age appears to increase autism risk in children, and the risk is seen with both mothers and fathers. Pediatrics, 2010. Expectant mothers suffering from asthma, allergies or a type of skin disease have a higher risk of giving birth to an autistic child. Obese mothers are more likely to have autistic children. Environmental pollutants, in addition to genetics, play a role in autism development. Children whose mothers took certain asthma drugs during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of autism. The study, published online Jan. 6 2016 in Pediatrics, found a connection between autism risk and prenatal exposure to drugs called beta-agonists. Children living in an area of New York state that uses aerial pesticides to control mosquitoes have a higher rate of autism than children in neighboring areas. Is it possible that children given too many vaccines could develop signs of autism? There is a debate in the medical community regarding the role of vaccines in causing or precipitating autism. Over the past two decades so many new vaccines have been added to a child's vaccination list that the medical community has little idea how all of these interact with each other and how they influence the immune system and neural tissue. There does not appear to be a link between the season or month a child is born and the subsequent risk. I have not seen any evidence that autism is a result of toxins or toxic metals. There are three large categories of autism treatment: Behavioral modification and communication approaches, dietary and nutritional approaches, complementary approaches. Tests on the brain tissue of 11 patients with autism who had died and spinal fluid from six living children with autism showed the activation of immune system responses. In a study published in the online edition of the Annals of Neurology, researchers said they found abnormal activity by immune system signaling chemicals called chemokines in the autistic patients. This ongoing inflammatory process was present in different areas of the brain and produced by cells known as microglia and astroglia. We didn't see as big of a change in him until the last 3 months when we put him on a GFCF diet ( flucose free casein free ) and had a local allergy doctor, Dr. Baptist recommend a bunch of supplements and B-12 injections. Any opinions about chelation therapy? I am not familiar with the use of chelation therapy for autism but I would be cautious. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": "Luteinizing hormone signals specialized cells in the testicles (Leydig cells) to secrete testosterone into the bloodstream; follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sperm production. The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. LHRH antagonists. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped. Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small \n\n Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism affects information processing in \n\nJune 17 2017 by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. \"We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia,\" said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish \"bricks\" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. \"Most gut bacteria are beneficial, aiding food digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful bacteria,� says Dae-Wook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, an author on the 2014 study. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain.\" My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora. Email November 2011 - A study came out last June which suggested that d-Ribose could be helpful for autism. Pilot study of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement for children with autistic spectrum disorder. J Altern Complement Med. Determine the effect of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement on children with autistic spectrum disorder. This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism. Pediatrics. Core symptoms of autism improved after vitamin d supplementation. This report is one case study of a 3 year old boy who improved after vitamn D supplementation. Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento, and her team report, \"Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome.\" In a 4-week study, 18 children, ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, with autistic spectrum disorder and/or fragile X syndrome were given either 3 mg melatonin or placebo each night for 2 weeks. The children then \"crossed over\" to the other treatment group for 2 weeks. The main feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Sleep problems are reported in the vast majority of children with autism and fragile X syndrome. The syndrome affects 2 to 4 percent of those with autism spectrum disorder, and symptoms of autism are common in children with fragile X. Having a parent or a mother with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia increases a child's risk of having autism. Low birth weight and preterm delivery are a cause. Advanced parental age appears to increase autism risk in children, and the risk is seen with both mothers and fathers. Pediatrics, 2010.

The Massachusetts team found shining a strobe light into rodents’ eyes encouraged protective cells to gobble up the harmful proteins that accumulate in the brain in this type of dementia. The perfect rate of flashes was 40 per second – a barely perceptible flicker, four times as fast as a disco strobe. One of the earliest changes seen in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease build-up of beta amyloid protein. When the mice were put in front of the flashing light for an hour, it led to a noticeable reduction in beta amyloid over the next 12 to 24 hours in the parts of the brain that handle vision. Likewise, light stimulation direct to the part of the brain that deals with memory – the hippocampus – led to reductions of beta amyloid there. The researchers say the light works by recruiting the help of resident immune cells called microglia. They eat and clear harmful or threatening pathogens – in this instance, beta amyloid. It is hoped that clearing beta amyloid and stopping more plaques from forming could halt Alzheimer’s and its symptoms. The scientists say, in the future, people could wear special goggles or sit in front of a light-emitting device to get a therapeutic dose of the strobe light. For the patient, it should be entirely painless and non-invasive. “We can use a very low intensity, very ambient soft light”. “The set-up is not offensive at all,” they said, stressing it should be safe and would not trigger epilepsy in people who were susceptible. Physical memory aids, typically worn on the wrist or finger, can help the user remember something they might otherwise forget. Common aids such as this are used by people with memory loss. Typical memory aids for people with Alzheimer's includes sticky notes and color-coded memory aids. One of the most well-known of these studies reported that reading words related to elderliness (e.g., \"Florida\", \"Bingo\") caused subjects to walk slower when exiting the laboratory, compared to subjects who read words unrelated to the elderly. The film involved two lights and two rooms. In particular, he used a Blackmagic cinema camera with a Tokina 11-16 lens, a Zoom H4N with a Røde NTG1 microphone, a paper lantern from IKEA, a 375-watt photo bulb, a Chinese knockoff redhead light from eBay, a Manfrotto tripod, a homemade dolly with PVC pipe, a piece of shelving from Ikea, and skate wheels. Saykin's team studied 120 adults aged 60 to 90 to determine whether gray matter changes in the brain's medial temporal lobe were similar to those seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (very early Alzheimer's). The degree of gray matter loss was associated with the extent of memory complaints and performance deficits, he added. One expert said the study is interesting because it could point to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Everything we're doing now says the therapy works better earlier,\" said Greg M. Cole, associate director of the University of California, Los Angeles' Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. \"This study took a comprehensive look and defined a subset of people who have essentially episodic problems yet do well on tests,\" Cole said. In other words, their forgetfulness occurred frequently and was noted by loved ones, yet the usual tests showed no obvious problem.

        "context": "After promising trials in mice, US scientists says, a flashing light therapy might help stave off Alzheimer’s. The Massachusetts team found shining a strobe light into rodents’ eyes encouraged protective cells to gobble up the harmful proteins that accumulate in the brain in this type of dementia. The perfect rate of flashes was 40 per second – a barely perceptible flicker, four times as fast as a disco strobe. One of the earliest changes seen in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease build-up of beta amyloid protein. When the mice were put in front of the flashing light for an hour, it led to a noticeable reduction in beta amyloid over the next 12 to 24 hours in the parts of the brain that handle vision. Likewise, light stimulation direct to the part of the brain that deals with memory – the hippocampus – led to reductions of beta amyloid there. The researchers say the light works by recruiting the help of resident immune cells called microglia. They eat and clear harmful or threatening pathogens – in this instance, beta amyloid. It is hoped that clearing beta amyloid and stopping more plaques from forming could halt Alzheimer’s and its symptoms. The scientists say, in the future, people could wear special goggles or sit in front of a light-emitting device to get a therapeutic dose of the strobe light. For the patient, it should be entirely painless and non-invasive. “We can use a very low intensity, very ambient soft light”. “The set-up is not offensive at all,” they said, stressing it should be safe and would not trigger epilepsy in people who were susceptible. Physical memory aids, typically worn on the wrist or finger, can help the user remember something they might otherwise forget. Common aids such as this are used by people with memory loss. Typical memory aids for people with Alzheimer's includes sticky notes and color-coded memory aids. One of the most well-known of these studies reported that reading words related to elderliness (e.g., \"Florida\", \"Bingo\") caused subjects to walk slower when exiting the laboratory, compared to subjects who read words unrelated to the elderly. The film involved two lights and two rooms. In particular, he used a Blackmagic cinema camera with a Tokina 11-16 lens, a Zoom H4N with a Røde NTG1 microphone, a paper lantern from IKEA, a 375-watt photo bulb, a Chinese knockoff redhead light from eBay, a Manfrotto tripod, a homemade dolly with PVC pipe, a piece of shelving from Ikea, and skate wheels. Saykin's team studied 120 adults aged 60 to 90 to determine whether gray matter changes in the brain's medial temporal lobe were similar to those seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (very early Alzheimer's). The degree of gray matter loss was associated with the extent of memory complaints and performance deficits, he added. One expert said the study is interesting because it could point to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Everything we're doing now says the therapy works better earlier,\" said Greg M. Cole, associate director of the University of California, Los Angeles' Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. \"This study took a comprehensive look and defined a subset of people who have essentially episodic problems yet do well on tests,\" Cole said. In other words, their forgetfulness occurred frequently and was noted by loved ones, yet the usual tests showed no obvious problem. Here, however, \"the researchers verified the gray matter changes that indicate disease prior to minimal cognitive impairment,\" Cole said. \"They're clicking back the ability to detect incipient Alzheimer's disease with some better confidence that it's truly Alzheimer's disease.\" Six years on, the 125 participants who did develop the illness were found to have weighed approximately 8 pounds less upon study entry than participants who remained free of Alzheimer's.

The White House Coronavirus Task Force was led by Vice President Mike Pence, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Congress appropriated $8.3billion in emergency funding, which Trump signed into law on March 6. During his oval office address on March 11, Trump announced an imminent travel ban between Europe and the U.S. The announcement caused chaos in European and American airports, as Americans abroad scrambled to get flights back to the U.S. The administration later had to clarify that the travel ban applied to foreigners coming from the Schengen Area, and later added Ireland and the UK to the list. Previously, in \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. By mid-April, disaster declarations were made by all states and territories as they all had increasing cases. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The next day, the country declared a public health emergency. The Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in January. On February 2, the U.S. enacted travel restrictions to and from China. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Three days later, the United States Department of State advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". September to December 2020\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota. On November 9, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. In spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than 2million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" January to April 2021\n\nOn January 1, 2021, the U.S. passed 20million cases, representing an increase of more than a million over the past week and 10million in less than two months. It was believed the variant had been present in the U.S. since October. In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. The country ultimately did not reach that goal, with only 67 percent of the overall adult population having done so by July 4. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. September to November 2021\nOn September 8, the U.S. passed 40million cases. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. December 2021 to January 2022\n\nResponses\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level3, its highest alert. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, the State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. However, Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through July. Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years earlier. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. Impacts\n\nEconomic\n\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating 30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Responding to Democratic proposals for nationwide mail-in voting as part of a COVID-19 relief law, President Trump said \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again\" despite evidence the change would not favor any particular group. High COVID-19 fatalities at the state and county level correlated with a drop in expressed support for the election of Republicans, including the reelection of Trump, according to a study published in Science Advances that compared opinions in January–February 2020 with opinions in June 2020. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Preparations made after previous outbreaks\n\nThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020. He accused Democrats and media outlets of exaggerating the seriousness of the situation, describing Democrats' criticism of his administration's response as a \"hoax\". By March 2020, however, Trump had adopted a more somber tone on the matter, acknowledging for the first time that COVID-19 was \"not under control\". Although the CDC recommended people wear face masks in public when social distancing is not possible, Trump continually refused to wear one. He praised and encouraged protesters who violated stay-at-home orders in Democratic states, as well as praised Republican governors who violated the White House's own COVID-19 guidelines regarding \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ().

On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. By mid-April, disaster declarations were made by all states and territories as they all had increasing cases. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The next day, the country declared a public health emergency. The Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in January. On February 2, the U.S. enacted travel restrictions to and from China. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Three days later, the United States Department of State advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". September to December 2020\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. Among their findings, cases increased 35 percent compared to 14 percent for the state after a Trump rally in Beltrami County, Minnesota. On November 9, President-elect Biden's transition team announced his COVID-19 Advisory Board. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. In spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than 2million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" January to April 2021\n\nOn January 1, 2021, the U.S. passed 20million cases, representing an increase of more than a million over the past week and 10million in less than two months. It was believed the variant had been present in the U.S. since October. In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. The country ultimately did not reach that goal, with only 67 percent of the overall adult population having done so by July 4. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. September to November 2021\nOn September 8, the U.S. passed 40million cases. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. December 2021 to January 2022\n\nResponses\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level3, its highest alert. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, the State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. However, Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through July. Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years earlier. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. Impacts\n\nEconomic\n\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating 30–40 million are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Responding to Democratic proposals for nationwide mail-in voting as part of a COVID-19 relief law, President Trump said \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again\" despite evidence the change would not favor any particular group. High COVID-19 fatalities at the state and county level correlated with a drop in expressed support for the election of Republicans, including the reelection of Trump, according to a study published in Science Advances that compared opinions in January–February 2020 with opinions in June 2020. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Preparations made after previous outbreaks\n\nThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020. He accused Democrats and media outlets of exaggerating the seriousness of the situation, describing Democrats' criticism of his administration's response as a \"hoax\". By March 2020, however, Trump had adopted a more somber tone on the matter, acknowledging for the first time that COVID-19 was \"not under control\". Although the CDC recommended people wear face masks in public when social distancing is not possible, Trump continually refused to wear one. He praised and encouraged protesters who violated stay-at-home orders in Democratic states, as well as praised Republican governors who violated the White House's own COVID-19 guidelines regarding \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing.

The gang operated in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Central America, the United States, as well as Canada and Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

It is the main foreign supplier of cannabis and an important entry point of South American cocaine and Asian methamphetamine to the United States. It is believed that almost half the cartels' revenues come from cannabis. Cocaine, heroin, and increasingly methamphetamine are also traded. The U.S. State Department estimates that 90 percent of cocaine entering the United States is produced in Colombia (followed by Bolivia and Peru) and that the main transit route is through Mexico. Although Mexico accounts for only a small share of worldwide heroin production, it supplies a large share of \n\nHeroin, also known as diacetylmorphine and diamorphine among other names, is an opioid used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. It is typically injected, usually into a vein, but it can also be smoked, snorted, or inhaled. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect of a similar dose of morphine. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. The total number of heroin users worldwide as of 2015 is believed to have increased in Africa, the Americas, and Asia since 2000. In the United States, approximately 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point, with 950,000 using it in the last year. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid and often heroin. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and it is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell without a license. About 448 tons of heroin were made in 2016. Illegal heroin is often mixed with other substances such as sugar, starch, caffeine, quinine, or other opioids like fentanyl. Uses\n\nRecreational\n\nBayer's original trade name (see 'History' section) of heroin is typically used in non-medical settings. Anthropologist Michael Agar once described heroin as \"the perfect whatever drug.\" Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. Medical uses\nIn the United States, heroin is not accepted as medically useful. Under the generic name diamorphine, heroin is prescribed as a strong pain medication in the United Kingdom, where it is administered via oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intranasal or intravenous routes. The initial Swiss HAT (Heroin-assisted treatment) trial (\"PROVE\" study) was conducted as a prospective cohort study with some 1,000 participants in 18 treatment centers between 1994 and 1996, at the end of 2004, 1,200 patients were enrolled in HAT in 23 treatment centers across Switzerland. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. In 1994, Switzerland began a trial diamorphine maintenance program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. Some Australian cities (such as Sydney) have instituted legal diamorphine supervised injecting centers, in line with other wider harm minimization programs. Since January 2009, Denmark has prescribed diamorphine to a few addicts who have tried methadone and buprenorphine without success. However, Danish addicts would only be able to inject heroin according to the policy set by Danish National Board of Health. The prescription heroin can be accessed by doctors through Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP) for \"emergency access to drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable.\" Routes of administration\n\nThe onset of heroin's effects depends upon the route of administration. A 2002 study suggests that a fast onset of action increases the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher the potential risk for psychological dependence/addiction. Large doses of heroin can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon. The serial killer Harold Shipman used diamorphine on his victims, and the subsequent Shipman Inquiry led to a tightening of the regulations surrounding the storage, prescribing and destruction of controlled drugs in the UK. Because significant tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly with continued use and is lost just as quickly during withdrawal, it is often difficult to determine whether a heroin lethal overdose was accidental, suicide or homicide. By mouth\nUse of heroin by mouth is less common than other methods of administration, mainly because there is little to no \"rush\", and the effects are less potent. Heroin's oral bioavailability is both dose-dependent (as is morphine's) and significantly higher than oral use of morphine itself, reaching up to 64.2% for high doses and 45.6% for low doses; opiate-naive users showed far less absorption of the drug at low doses, having bioavailabilities of only up to 22.9%. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users share a common needle without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, can be transmitted. Smoking\nSmoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, rather than burning and inhaling the smoke. Heroin may be smoked from aluminium foil, that is heated by a flame underneath it, with the resulting smoke inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil, a method also known as \"chasing the dragon\". Insufflation\nAnother popular route to intake heroin is insufflation (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled-up banknote, as with cocaine) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the mucous membrane of the sinus cavity and straight into the bloodstream. A \"rush\" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Adverse effects\n\nHeroin is classified as a hard drug in terms of drug harmfulness. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin – although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. Heroin use has also been associated with myocardial infarction. Long term effects \n\nRepeated heroin use changes the physical structure and physiology of the brain, creating long-term imbalances in neuronal and hormonal systems that are not easily reversed. Studies have shown some deterioration of the brain's white matter due to heroin use, which may affect decision-making abilities, the ability to regulate behavior, and responses to stressful situations. Heroin also produces profound degrees of tolerance and physical dependence. Injection \nIntravenous use of heroin (and any other substance) with needles and syringes or other related equipment may lead to:\n\n Contracting blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis via the sharing of needles\n Contracting bacterial or fungal endocarditis and possibly venous sclerosis\nAbscesses\n Poisoning from contaminants added to \"cut\" or dilute heroin\nDecreased kidney function (nephropathy), although it is not currently known if this is because of adulterants or infectious diseases\n\nWithdrawal\n\nThe withdrawal syndrome from heroin may begin within as little as two hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose, and more typically begins within 6–24 hours after cessation. Overdose\n\nHeroin overdose is usually treated with the opioid antagonist, naloxone. This reverses the effects of heroin and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in withdrawal symptoms. Between 2012 and 2015, heroin was the leading cause of drug related deaths in the United States. Since then fentanyl has been a more common cause of drug related deaths. Illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. It has been speculated that an unknown portion of heroin-related deaths are the result of an overdose or allergic reaction to quinine, which may sometimes be used as a cutting agent. This causes increased release of dopamine in the brain which is the reason for euphoric and rewarding effects of heroin. These physiological alterations lead to tolerance and dependence, so that stopping heroin use results in uncomfortable symptoms including pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia called the opioid withdrawal syndrome. The head of Bayer's research department reputedly coined the drug's new name of \"heroin,\" based on the German heroisch which means \"heroic, strong\" (from the ancient Greek word \"heros, ήρως\"). Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led the commercialization of heroin. In 1895, Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug under the trademark name Heroin. From 1898 through to 1910, diamorphine was marketed under the trademark name Heroin as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough suppressant. It is now a Schedule I substance, which makes it illegal for non-medical use in signatory nations of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, including the United States. Use of heroin by jazz musicians in particular was prevalent in the mid-twentieth century, including Billie Holiday, saxophonists Charlie Parker and Art Pepper, guitarist Joe Pass and piano player/singer Ray Charles; a \"staggering number of jazz musicians were addicts\". James Taylor, Jimmy Page, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, Keith Richards and Janis Joplin also used heroin. Many musicians have made songs referencing their heroin usage. Other synonyms for heroin include: diacetylmorphine, and morphine diacetate. Heroin is also known by many street names including dope, H, smack, junk, horse, scag, and brown, among others. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing diamorphine is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Europe\nIn the Netherlands, diamorphine is a List I drug of the Opium Law. In Switzerland, heroin is produced in injectable or tablet form under the name Diaphin by a private company under contract to the Swiss government. Swiss-produced heroin has been imported into Canada with government approval. Australia\nIn Australia diamorphine is listed as a schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). North America\nIn Canada, diamorphine is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Possession of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for life. In the United States, diamorphine is a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, making it illegal to possess without a DEA license. Possession of more than 100 grams of diamorphine or a mixture containing diamorphine is punishable with a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years of imprisonment in a federal prison. In 2021, the US state of Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the use of heroin after voters passed Ballot Measure 110 in 2020. This may ultimately lead to heroin injection because heroin is cheaper than prescribed pills. Economics\n\nProduction\nDiamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. This highly impure brown heroin base may then undergo further purification steps, which produces a white-colored product; the final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names. Heroin purity has been classified into four grades. No.1 and No.2 are unprocessed raw heroin (salt or base). Trafficking\n\nTraffic is heavy worldwide, with the biggest producer being Afghanistan. According to a U.N. sponsored survey, in 2004, Afghanistan accounted for production of 87 percent of the world's diamorphine. In 2003 The Independent reported:\n\nOpium production in that country has increased rapidly since, reaching an all-time high in 2006. There is also cultivation of opium poppies in Pakistan (), Mexico () and in Colombia (). According to the DEA, the majority of the heroin consumed in the United States comes from Mexico (50%) and Colombia (43-45%) via Mexican criminal cartels such as Sinaloa Cartel. However, these statistics may be significantly unreliable, the DEA's 50/50 split between Colombia and Mexico is contradicted by the amount of hectares cultivated in each country and in 2014, the DEA claimed most of the heroin in the US came from Colombia. , the Sinaloa Cartel is the most active drug cartel involved in smuggling illicit drugs such as heroin into the United States and trafficking them throughout the United States. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 90% of the heroin seized in Canada (where the origin was known) came from Afghanistan. Pakistan is the destination and transit point for 40 percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan, other destinations of Afghan opiates are Russia, Europe and Iran. A conviction for trafficking heroin carries the death penalty in most Southeast Asian, some East Asian and Middle Eastern countries (see Use of death penalty worldwide for details), among which Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are the most strict. Trafficking history\n\nThe origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of the government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Heroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the US during World War II because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium. After World War II, the Mafia took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily. The Mafia took advantage of Sicily's location along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States. Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s. Although it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century. This helped the development of the Golden Triangle opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in the US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle, was the second-largest producer of heroin, after Afghanistan. By 1980, 60 percent of the heroin sold in the US originated in Afghanistan. It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. Following the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a toner cartridge that had been modified into an improvised explosive device, the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approximately 30 percent in the cost of street heroin and increased demand for diverted methadone. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period. Other heroin droughts (shortages) have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009. Many people thought that the American government had introduced pathogens into the Afghanistan atmosphere in order to destroy the opium crop and thus starve insurgents of income. Based on heroin production statistics compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2006, Bagcho's activities accounted for approximately 20 percent of the world's total production for that year. Street price\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports that the retail price of brown heroin varies from €14.5 per gram in Turkey to €110 per gram in Sweden, with most European countries reporting typical prices of €35–40 per gram. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime claims in its 2008 World Drug Report that typical US retail prices are US$172 per gram. This has had the effect of drastically reducing an area's crime rate as individuals arrested for theft in order to supply the funds for their drugs are no longer in the position of having to steal to purchase heroin because they have been placed onto a methadone program, quite often more quickly than would have been possible had they not been arrested. In 1994, Zurich started a pilot project using prescription heroin in heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) which allowed users to obtain heroin and inject it under medical supervision.

Since 2003 Mexican cartels have used the dense, isolated portions of U.S. federal and state parks and forests to grow marijuana under the canopy of thick trees. Billions of dollars’ worth of marijuana has been produced annually on U.S. soil. \"In 2006, federal and state authorities seized over 550,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated 1 billion dollars in Kentucky's remote Appalachian counties\". Cartels profited from marijuana growing operations from Arkansas to Hawaii. A 2018 study found that the reduction in drugs from Colombia contributed to Mexican drug violence. The study estimated, \"between 2006 and 2009 the decline in cocaine supply from Colombia could account for 10%–14% of the increase in violence in Mexico.\" In 2001, U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Puerto Rico seized 56 kilograms of heroin from commercial aircraft at airports and 28 kilograms of heroin from commercial maritime vessels in Puerto Rico. That same year, government officials arrested seven individuals in Puerto Rico, for swallowing between 36 and 98 condoms full of heroin, when they arrived from Aruba on a cruise ship. In June 2002, drug detecting dogs detected and CBP seized 24 kilograms of heroin in a cargo storage area on a pier in San Juan. That same year federal law enforcement officials in San Juan seized 1.4 kilograms of heroin from a passenger arriving from Aruba on a cruise ship.

It is typically injected, usually into a vein, but it can also be smoked, snorted, or inhaled. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect of a similar dose of morphine. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. The total number of heroin users worldwide as of 2015 is believed to have increased in Africa, the Americas, and Asia since 2000. In the United States, approximately 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point, with 950,000 using it in the last year. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid and often heroin. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and it is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell without a license. About 448 tons of heroin were made in 2016. Illegal heroin is often mixed with other substances such as sugar, starch, caffeine, quinine, or other opioids like fentanyl. Uses\n\nRecreational\n\nBayer's original trade name (see 'History' section) of heroin is typically used in non-medical settings. Anthropologist Michael Agar once described heroin as \"the perfect whatever drug.\" Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. Medical uses\nIn the United States, heroin is not accepted as medically useful. Under the generic name diamorphine, heroin is prescribed as a strong pain medication in the United Kingdom, where it is administered via oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intranasal or intravenous routes. The initial Swiss HAT (Heroin-assisted treatment) trial (\"PROVE\" study) was conducted as a prospective cohort study with some 1,000 participants in 18 treatment centers between 1994 and 1996, at the end of 2004, 1,200 patients were enrolled in HAT in 23 treatment centers across Switzerland. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. In 1994, Switzerland began a trial diamorphine maintenance program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. Some Australian cities (such as Sydney) have instituted legal diamorphine supervised injecting centers, in line with other wider harm minimization programs. Since January 2009, Denmark has prescribed diamorphine to a few addicts who have tried methadone and buprenorphine without success. However, Danish addicts would only be able to inject heroin according to the policy set by Danish National Board of Health. The prescription heroin can be accessed by doctors through Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP) for \"emergency access to drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable.\" Routes of administration\n\nThe onset of heroin's effects depends upon the route of administration.

Since 2003 Mexican cartels have used the dense, isolated portions of U.S. federal and state parks and forests to grow marijuana under the canopy of thick trees. Billions of dollars’ worth of marijuana has been produced annually on U.S. soil. \"In 2006, federal and state authorities seized over 550,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated 1 billion dollars in Kentucky's remote Appalachian counties\". Cartels profited from marijuana growing operations from Arkansas to Hawaii. A 2018 study found that the reduction in drugs from Colombia contributed to Mexican drug violence. The study estimated, \"between 2006 and 2009 the decline in cocaine supply from Colombia could account for 10%–14% of the increase in violence in Mexico.\" In 2001, U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Puerto Rico seized 56 kilograms of heroin from commercial aircraft at airports and 28 kilograms of heroin from commercial maritime vessels in Puerto Rico. That same year, government officials arrested seven individuals in Puerto Rico, for swallowing between 36 and 98 condoms full of heroin, when they arrived from Aruba on a cruise ship. In June 2002, drug detecting dogs detected and CBP seized 24 kilograms of heroin in a cargo storage area on a pier in San Juan. That same year federal law enforcement officials in San Juan seized 1.4 kilograms of heroin from a passenger arriving from Aruba on a cruise ship.

Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing.

In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. \"It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future,\" he tells WebMD. The new drug works differently than statins do. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins. Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD. This REGN727 study was funded by Sanofi U.S. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which make the drug.

Almost all were taking modest or large doses of statins. \"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine\". \"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres\".

For the older generation, balance and muscle endurance is improved by playing golf, which is likely to help in maintaining a strong cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic health status. \"Evidence suggests golfers live longer than non-golfers, enjoying improvements in cholesterol levels, body composition, wellness, self-esteem and self-worth,” explained Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Murray, from the physical activity for health research centre at the University of Edinburgh. \"Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages. “One study in Sweden found regular golfers lived an average of five years longer than non-golfers.\" He also added that only 55 million people – which equals about one per cent of the world’s population – actually indulge in golf as a sport or hobby. \"We have to get away from the idea golf's only a rich man's sport - 78 percent of the courses across the world are available for the public to play on, not just members.\" Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, playing golf has numerous physical and mental health benefits. The study reviewed 5,000 studies on golf and wellbeing and found that the sport has high physical and mental health benefits for individuals of all ages. Here are some of the benefits associated with playing golf:\n\n1. Increased life expectancy: The study found that golfers generally live longer, with an average increase in life expectancy of five years compared to non-golfers. Prevention of chronic diseases: Golf can help prevent 40 chronic diseases, including diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Regular golfing has been associated with improved cholesterol, body composition, wellness, self-esteem, and self-worth. Aid in chronic disease management: Golf can be beneficial for individuals already suffering from chronic diseases like heart disease, colon and breast cancer, type-2 diabetes, and stroke. Reduction in mental health issues: Playing golf has been linked to reduced anxiety levels, depression, and dementia risk. The sport provides an opportunity for outdoor exercise, social interaction, and relaxation, which contribute to better mental well-being. It's worth noting that golf can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from the very young to the elderly. So, if you're looking to improve your physical and mental health, golf can be a great activity to consider.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For the older generation, balance and muscle endurance is improved by playing golf, which is likely to help in maintaining a strong cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic health status. \"Evidence suggests golfers live longer than non-golfers, enjoying improvements in cholesterol levels, body composition, wellness, self-esteem and self-worth,” explained Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Murray, from the physical activity for health research centre at the University of Edinburgh. \"Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages. “One study in Sweden found regular golfers lived an average of five years longer than non-golfers.\" He also added that only 55 million people – which equals about one per cent of the world’s population – actually indulge in golf as a sport or hobby. \"We have to get away from the idea golf's only a rich man's sport - 78 percent of the courses across the world are available for the public to play on, not just members.\" Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, playing golf has numerous physical and mental health benefits. The study reviewed 5,000 studies on golf and wellbeing and found that the sport has high physical and mental health benefits for individuals of all ages. Here are some of the benefits associated with playing golf:\n\n1. Increased life expectancy: The study found that golfers generally live longer, with an average increase in life expectancy of five years compared to non-golfers. Prevention of chronic diseases: Golf can help prevent 40 chronic diseases, including diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Regular golfing has been associated with improved cholesterol, body composition, wellness, self-esteem, and self-worth. Aid in chronic disease management: Golf can be beneficial for individuals already suffering from chronic diseases like heart disease, colon and breast cancer, type-2 diabetes, and stroke. Reduction in mental health issues: Playing golf has been linked to reduced anxiety levels, depression, and dementia risk. The sport provides an opportunity for outdoor exercise, social interaction, and relaxation, which contribute to better mental well-being. It's worth noting that golf can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from the very young to the elderly. So, if you're looking to improve your physical and mental health, golf can be a great activity to consider.\n\n"

About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena. FDA approves Bayer’s Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg for prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. In 2003, the FDA rejected Intrinsa, a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The reasons cited were limited efficacy (about one additional sexually satisfying event per month), concerns about safety and potential adverse effects with long-term therapy, and concerns about inappropriate off-label use. The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a \"black box\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods.

COVID-19 patients hospitalized on October 22 reached a record high of 355, including 75 in Intensive Care Units. An internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston said a frustrated patient at another hospital repeatedly told her to \"go back to your country.\" At some hospitals, hospitalists or nurses make post-discharge phone calls, but a heavy patient load can make this difficult to fit into the schedule. In response to this situation, several companies have recently launched post-discharge services, which contract with hospitals to handle the necessary phone calls. “There was a large need for supporting hospitals as they manage their patients from discharge through to home…They are facing competing and changing priorities, on top of a lack of resources. Not to mention there's the physical challenge of trying to manage patient engagement once they leave the four walls of the hospital,” said Sean Hughes, vice president of Vree Health, a Merck subsidiary that recently launched a post-discharge service called TransitionAdvantage. In addition to these potential clinical benefits, some of the services monitor, and aim to improve, patient satisfaction as well. Typically, the post-discharge callers don't have any contact with hospitalists, but they do share a goal. “What we're all trying to achieve is satisfaction and safety,” said Jeff Forbes, president of SironaHealth, which offers a post-discharge service. Acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia round out the payment-penalized trio targeted by most services, but post-discharge programs are starting to look at other diagnoses as well, experts said, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and diabetes. “If there's a follow-up regimen, are there any barriers to compliance with that regimen? That's a particular target of the WellTransitions program, which is staffed by pharmacists. If a patient stops taking a medication, we rarely get notified. Transfer of information from the inpatient to outpatient setting is another component of some post-discharge services. Although it depends on the accessibility of a hospital's system, the post-discharge services are generally able to pull at least some information from the inpatient electronic medical record. No matter what the state of the medical records, all of the services strive to ensure that the patient has a follow-up outpatient appointment. “A lot of the patients don't know where to go. I don't remember which doctor because I saw eight during my stay,’” described Nicole Nicoloff, vice president of market strategy and innovation at BerylHealth, which offers a post-discharge service. If a patient reports not having a follow-up, the post- discharge services take action, the specifics of which depend on the service and/or the protocols set by the hospital. They may refer the patient back to the discharge coordinator at the hospital, or take care of the issue immediately.

After verification that the weight measurement is valid, the caller would take action, triaging the patient up to the program's nurse hotline, or contacting a prespecified in- or outpatient clinician. In some programs, chronic disease patients get their checkup phone calls directly from a nurse, who either deals with any clinical issues or passes the patient along to someone at the hospital. “The hospital specifies what we're going to follow up on, and specifically how they need that documented,” said Ms. Nicoloff. The hospital also typically lends its name to the post-discharge service, so that patients see the follow-up as coming from a familiar institution, if not a provider they've met before. Most of the post-discharge services collect satisfaction data at some point in their contact with the discharged patients, then relay the data to the hospital, either as a routine report or more urgently, if necessary. “If the patient says, ‘I want to sue the hospital,’ the system automatically sends an email to risk management with all the details.

        "context": " City Journal, she defended her views, citing analysis by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group known for promoting pseudoscience. COVID-19 patients hospitalized on October 22 reached a record high of 355, including 75 in Intensive Care Units. An internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston said a frustrated patient at another hospital repeatedly told her to \"go back to your country.\" At some hospitals, hospitalists or nurses make post-discharge phone calls, but a heavy patient load can make this difficult to fit into the schedule. In response to this situation, several companies have recently launched post-discharge services, which contract with hospitals to handle the necessary phone calls. “There was a large need for supporting hospitals as they manage their patients from discharge through to home…They are facing competing and changing priorities, on top of a lack of resources. Not to mention there's the physical challenge of trying to manage patient engagement once they leave the four walls of the hospital,” said Sean Hughes, vice president of Vree Health, a Merck subsidiary that recently launched a post-discharge service called TransitionAdvantage. In addition to these potential clinical benefits, some of the services monitor, and aim to improve, patient satisfaction as well. Typically, the post-discharge callers don't have any contact with hospitalists, but they do share a goal. “What we're all trying to achieve is satisfaction and safety,” said Jeff Forbes, president of SironaHealth, which offers a post-discharge service. Acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia round out the payment-penalized trio targeted by most services, but post-discharge programs are starting to look at other diagnoses as well, experts said, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and diabetes. “If there's a follow-up regimen, are there any barriers to compliance with that regimen? That's a particular target of the WellTransitions program, which is staffed by pharmacists. If a patient stops taking a medication, we rarely get notified. Transfer of information from the inpatient to outpatient setting is another component of some post-discharge services. Although it depends on the accessibility of a hospital's system, the post-discharge services are generally able to pull at least some information from the inpatient electronic medical record. No matter what the state of the medical records, all of the services strive to ensure that the patient has a follow-up outpatient appointment. “A lot of the patients don't know where to go. I don't remember which doctor because I saw eight during my stay,’” described Nicole Nicoloff, vice president of market strategy and innovation at BerylHealth, which offers a post-discharge service. If a patient reports not having a follow-up, the post- discharge services take action, the specifics of which depend on the service and/or the protocols set by the hospital.

Here, she offers advice for safer workouts — and explains why the latest exercise craze can potentially do more harm than good. Basically, any activity that involves repetitive movement — running, cycling, hitting a tennis ball, swinging a golf club, etc. You should gradually increase first the amount of time and then the intensity level of your workouts. If you do a gradual build, you’ll be a lot less likely to end up with overuse injuries. Also, make sure that you’re giving your body a sufficient recovery period between activities. Initially, a day or two in between exercise bouts should be adequate, but make sure to listen to your body. Clues that you are not allowing enough recovery time may include continued muscle soreness and/or fatigue. If you try doing high intensity workouts seven days a week, the risk of breaking down and sustaining an injury is high. Your body needs time to recover and rebuild. That’s true even for elite athletes. They train hard, but they also take time to rest. It’s interesting that yoga is generally perceived as this relaxing Zen kind of thing. If your body doesn’t seem able to get into a pretzel position, that’s probably not a good position for you. You may feel a bit of embarrassment or self-consciousness. What you need to remember is that some of these people who make it look so easy have been doing yoga for a long time. We all want to get in shape and lose weight yesterday, but as we get older, it takes more time for the body to adapt to changes. It’s true that you might experience a little muscle soreness from exercise and feel achy the next day. For everyday folk, “no pain no gain” shouldn’t be the mantra. You’re given a DVD featuring someone who is supposedly an expert in their field, and you’re trying to mimic the exercises with no supervision. But what you need to keep in mind is that there are some exercises people with certain conditions shouldn’t do. For example, if you have knee problems, you may not want to do exercises that are high impact or require you to twist your knees. Start out doing 10 to 15 minutes at a lower intensity, and if an exercise doesn’t feel comfortable or you’re not sure about the proper way to do it, skip that particular exercise. Gradually increase the amount of time you spend on the workout. I would say the key is doing a variety of exercises — asking your muscles to do some different activities and working different muscles in your body, giving specific muscle groups breaks. Also, your program should include flexibility, strength and aerobic components. If you’re stronger, you’ll have better endurance and be less likely to sustain injuries. I also see people who are very good at aerobics, and that’s all they want to do; they don’t want to lift weights. But they should be doing some weight training because fitness is really about balance: You need to have good flexibility, good strength and good aerobic conditioning to optimize your body’s overall condition. This entry was posted in Articles, Injury, MidwestOrtho, Prevention, Training, Yoga by sportsmedicineweekly. Can lifting weights fix my lower-back pain? Nonetheless, this one-size-fits-all approach has limitations, according to University of Waterloo professor of spine biomechanics Stuart McGill. “There’s actually no such thing as non-specific back pain,” he says. Certainly, you shouldn’t persist with any exercise that causes pain or discomfort (a rule Kell enforced during the studies). At the end of the experiment, one group had gained 32 percent more upper-body strength and 47 percent more lower-body strength than the other. They compared two groups of 100 volunteers who undertook a 12-week strength training program, supervised either by one trainer for every five athletes, or one trainer for every 25 athletes. Do I need extra protein to build muscle? On this basic question, athletes and scientists remain deeply divided. At McMaster and elsewhere, researchers have spent years conducting careful studies of how much protein exercisers can actually use. “We monitor the food going in and collect the poop, pee, and sweat going out,” explains Mark Tarnopolsky, one of Phillips’s colleagues. Surprisingly—but consistently—the results show that even serious athletes process only marginally more protein than their sedentary peers, and far less than the megadoses recommended by muscle magazines. That leaves would-be bodybuilders with a choice: Do you take the advice of the egghead in the lab or the muscle-head in the gym? That means an ordinary, balanced diet should easily meet your needs—unless you’re restricting calories to lose weight. In that case, higher protein intakes (35 percent of calories instead of 15 percent, for example) combined with resistance training appear to help maintain muscle mass while overall mass drops. Timing also matters: you’ll build muscle more effectively if you take in protein within about an hour of finishing your workout. Powders, shakes, and bars offer a convenient way to get this right after a workout—but then again, so does a tuna sandwich. In the end, if you decide to side with the gym rats and supersize your protein shakes, it’s unlikely to do much harm. The main drawback is that, by taking too much protein, you might end up not getting enough of the carbohydrates that are crucial to performance in both endurance and strength athletes—and that risk should be enough to keep any smart athlete from overdoing the protein.

These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or child mortality. While women in the United States tend to live longer than men, they generally are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more \n\nInfant mortality is the death of young children under the age of 1. This death toll is measured by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which is the probability of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births. One of the most common preventable causes of infant mortality is smoking during pregnancy. Lack of prenatal care, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and drug use also cause complications which may result in infant mortality. Many environmental factors contribute to infant mortality, such as the mother's level of education, environmental conditions, and political and medical infrastructure. Improving sanitation, access to clean drinking water, immunization against infectious diseases, and other public health measures can help reduce high rates of infant mortality. More than 60% of these deaths are seen as being avoidable with low-cost measures such as continuous breast-feeding, vaccinations and improved nutrition. The child mortality rate, but not the infant mortality rate, was an indicator used to monitor progress towards the Fourth Goal of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations for the year 2015. Throughout the world, infant mortality rate (IMR) fluctuates drastically, and according to Biotechnology and Health Sciences, education and life expectancy in the country is the leading indicator of IMR. Classification\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. Forms of infant mortality:\n Perinatal mortality is late fetal death (22 weeks gestation to birth), or death of a newborn up to one week postpartum. This accounts for 40–60% of infant mortality in developing countries. The major contributors to postneonatal death are malnutrition, infectious disease, troubled pregnancy, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and problems with the home environment. Causes \nCauses of infant mortality directly lead to the death. Environmental and social barriers prevent access to basic medical resources and thus contribute to an increasing infant mortality rate; 99% of infant deaths occur in developing countries, and 86% of these deaths are due to infections, premature births, complications during delivery, and perinatal asphyxia and birth injuries. In the United States, a primary determinant of infant mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk of infant mortality. Medicine and biology \nCauses of infant mortality and deaths that are related to medical conditions include: low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, malnutrition, congenital malformations, and infectious diseases, low income for health care including neglected tropical diseases. Lower gestational age increases the risk of infant mortality. Premature birth can be either spontaneous, or medically induced. Despite these risk factors, the underlying causes of premature infant death are often unknown and approximately 65% of all cases are not associated with any known risk factor. While the exact mechanisms responsible for inducing premature birth are often unknown, many of the underlying risk factors are associated with inflammation. Approximately \"80% preterm births that occur at <1000 g or at <28 to 30 weeks of gestation\" have been associated with inflammation. This disease is more common in Western countries. So much so, the United States Center for Disease Control reports Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to be the leading cause of death in infants age 1 month to 1 year of life. In more developed countries such as the United States, there was a rise in infant deaths due to congenital malformations. In the 19th century, there was a decrease in the number of infant deaths from heart diseases. From 1979 to 1997, there was a 39% decline in infant mortality due to heart problems. Low birth weight \n\nLow birth weight makes up 60–80% of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. The New England Journal of Medicine stated that \"The lowest mortality rates occur among infants weighing . For infants born weighing  or less, the mortality rate rapidly increases with decreasing weight, and most of the infants weighing  or less die. As compared with normal-birth-weight infants, those with low weight at birth are almost 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; for infants with very low weight at birth the relative risk of neonatal death is almost 200 times greater.\" Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually a direct cause stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of prenatal care, maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environments. Along with birth weight, period of gestation makes up the two most important predictors of an infant's chances of survival and their overall health. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, \"in the past two decades, the infant mortality rate (deaths under one year of age per thousand live births) in the United States has declined sharply.\" Low birth weights from African American mothers remain twice as high as that of white women. Although it is preventable, the solutions may not be the easiest but effective programs to help prevent LBW are a combination of health care, education, environment, mental modification and public policy, influencing a culture supporting lifestyle. Even though America excels past many other countries in the care and saving of premature infants, the percentage of American woman who deliver prematurely is comparable to those in developing countries. Also, women who do not have access to health care are less likely to visit a doctor, therefore increasing their risk of delivering prematurely. It is especially prevalent in women and infants under 5 who live in developing countries within the poorer regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It is difficult to assess the most pressing factor as they can intertwine and vary among regions. Such characteristics entail difference in weight-and-height ratios for age in comparison to adequate standards. The mother may not be aware of the infection, or she may have an untreated pelvic inflammatory disease or sexually transmitted disease. Seven out of ten childhood deaths are due to infectious diseases: acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, measles, and malaria. Specifically, air pollution is highly associated with SIDs in the United States during the post-neonatal stage. High infant mortality is exacerbated because newborns are a vulnerable subgroup that is affected by air pollution. Women who are exposed to greater air pollution on a daily basis who are pregnant should be closely watched by their doctors, as well as after the baby is born. As expected, babies who live in environments with more air pollution are at greater risk for infant mortality. The key pollutant for infant mortality rates is carbon monoxide. Among women having their second or higher birth, smokers experienced 30% greater mortality than nonsmokers.\" Modern research in the United States on racial disparities in infant mortality suggests a link between the institutionalized racism that pervades the environment and high rates of African American infant mortality. In synthesis of this research, it has been observed that \"African American infant mortality remains elevated due to the social arrangements that exist between groups and the lifelong experiences responding to the resultant power dynamics of these arrangements.\" It is important to note that infant mortality rates do not decline among African Americans even if their socio-economic status does improve. Stress is a lead factor in inducing labor in pregnant women, and therefore high levels of stress during pregnancy could lead to premature births that have the potential to be fatal for the infant. Early childhood trauma\nEarly childhood trauma includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of a child ages zero to five years-old. Trauma in early development has extreme impact over the course of a lifetime and is a significant contributor to infant mortality. There is a direct relationship between age of maltreatment/injury and risk for death. The younger an infant is, the more dangerous the maltreatment. Family configuration, child gender, social isolation, lack of support, maternal youth, marital status, poverty, parental ACES, and parenting practices are thought to contribute to increased risk. Socio-economic factors\n\nSocial class is a major factor in infant mortality, both historically and today. In cases where the father had no income, the rate of infant mortality was 357% more than that for the highest income earners ($1,250+). African-American mothers experience infant mortality at a rate 44% higher than average; however, research indicates that socio-economic factors do not totally account for the racial disparities in infant mortality. While infant mortality is normally negatively correlated with GDP, there may indeed be some opposing short-term effects from a recession. A recent study by The Economist showed that economic slowdowns reduce the amount of air pollution, which results in a lower infant mortality rate. It is only during deep recessions that infant mortality increases. According to Norbert Schady and Marc-François Smitz, recessions when GDP per capita drops by 15% or more increase infant mortality. Social class dictates which medical services are available to an individual. Developed countries, most notably the United States, have seen a divergence between those living in poverty who cannot afford medical advanced resources, leading to an increased chance of infant mortality, and others. Levels of socioeconomic development and global integration are inversely related to a nation's infant mortality rate. If the nation's ability to raise its own revenues is compromised, governments will lose funding for its health service programs, including services that aim in decreasing infant mortality rates. Even with a strong economy and economic growth (measured by a country's gross national product), the advances of medical technologies may not be felt by everyone, lending itself to increasing social disparities. Infant mortality rates correlate with war, political unrest, and government corruption. However, many other significant factors influence infant mortality rates in war-torn areas. Health care systems in developing countries in the midst of war often collapse. Attaining basic medical supplies and care becomes increasingly difficult. Expecting mothers are affected even more by lack of access to food and water. Women who become pregnant as a result of war rape face even more significant challenges in bearing a healthy child. Causes of infant mortality in abused women range from physical side effects of the initial trauma to psychological effects that lead to poor adjustment to society. Culture \nHigh rates of infant mortality occur in developing countries where financial and material resources are scarce and there is a high tolerance to high number of infant deaths. There are circumstances where a number of developing countries to breed a culture where situations of infant mortality such as favoring male babies over female babies are the norm. In developing countries such as Brazil, infant mortality rates are commonly not recorded due to failure to register for death certificates. Another cultural reason for infant mortality, such as what is happening in Ghana, is that \"besides the obvious, like rutted roads, there are prejudices against wives or newborns leaving the house.\" Because of this it is making it even more difficult for the women and newborns to get the treatment that is available to them and that is needed. Cultural influences and lifestyle habits in the United States can account for some deaths in infants throughout the years. All are possible causes of premature births, which constitute the second highest cause of infant mortality. Male sex favoritism\nHistorically, males have had higher infant mortality rates than females. The difference between male and female infant mortality rates have been dependent on environmental, social, and economic conditions. More specifically, males are biologically more vulnerable to infections and conditions associated with prematurity and development. Before 1970, the reasons for male infant mortality were due to infections, and chronic degenerative diseases. However, since 1970, certain cultures emphasizing males has led to a decrease in the infant mortality gap between males and females. Also, medical advances have resulted in a growing number of male infants surviving at higher rates than females due to the initial high infant mortality rate of males. As infant mortality rates saw a decrease on a global scale, the gender most affected by infant mortality changed from males experiences a biological disadvantage, to females facing a societal disadvantage. Births spaced at least three years apart from one another are associated with the lowest rate of mortality. The longer the interval between births, the lower the risk for having any birthing complications, and infant, childhood and maternal mortality. Higher rates of pre-term births, and low birth weight are associated with birth to conception intervals of less than six months and abortion to pregnancy interval of less than six months. Shorter intervals between births increase the chances of chronic and general under-nutrition; 57% of women in 55 developing countries reported birth spaces shorter than three years; 26% report birth spacing of less than two years. Only 20% of post-partum women report wanting another birth within two years; however, only 40% are taking necessary steps such as family planning to achieve the birth intervals they want. Unplanned pregnancies and birth intervals of less than twenty-four months are known to correlate with low birth weights and delivery complications. Also, women who are already small in stature tend to deliver smaller than average babies, perpetuating a cycle of being underweight. Prevention and outcomes\nTo reduce infant mortality rates across the world, health practitioners, governments, and non-governmental organizations have worked to create institutions, programs and policies to generate better health outcomes. Governments can reduce the mortality rates by addressing the combined need for education (such as universal primary education), nutrition, and access to basic maternal and infant health services. Reducing chances of babies being born at low birth weights and contracting pneumonia can be accomplished by improving air quality. Overall, women's health status need to remain high. Focusing on preventing preterm and low birth weight deliveries throughout all populations can help to eliminate cases of infant mortality and decrease health care disparities within communities. In the United States, these two goals have decreased infant mortality rates on a regional population, it has yet to see further progress on a national level. Increasing human resources such as physicians, nurses, and other health professionals will increase the number of skilled attendants and the number of people able to give out immunized against diseases such as measles. Increasing the number of skilled professionals is negatively correlated with maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. In certain parts of the U.S., specific modern programs aim to reduce levels of infant mortality. Prenatal care and maternal health \nWhen a woman becomes pregnant, certain steps can help to reduce the chance of complications during the pregnancy. Attending regular prenatal care check-ups will help improve the baby's chances of being delivered in safer conditions and surviving. Pregnant women should consult with their doctors to best manage any existing health conditions that they have to avoid complications of both their health as well as the fetus. Additionally, they are more likely to experience a pre-term birth or have a child with birth defects. For this reason, breast feeding is favored over formula feeding by healthcare professionals. As aforementioned in a previous section, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is the leading cause of infant mortality for those 1 month of age to 1 year of age. Socio-economic factors\nIt has been well documented that increased education among mothers, communities, and local health workers results in better family planning, improvement on children's health, and lower rates of children's deaths. Awareness of health services, education, and economic opportunities provide means to sustain and increase chance of development and survival. A decrease in GDP, for example, results in increased rates of infant mortality. Negative effects on household income reduces amount being spent on food and healthcare, affecting the quality of life and access to medical services to ensure full development and survival. Differences in measurement\n\nThe infant mortality rate correlates very strongly with, and is among the best predictors of, state failure. However, the method of calculating IMR often varies widely between countries and is based on how they define a live birth and how many premature infants are born in the country. Reporting of infant mortality rates can be inconsistent, and may be understated, depending on a nation's live birth criterion, vital registration system, and reporting practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a live birth as any infant born demonstrating independent signs of life, including breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation or definite movement of voluntary muscles. France) and Japan, only count as live births cases where an infant breathes at birth, which makes their reported IMR numbers somewhat lower and increases their rates of perinatal mortality. Although many countries have vital registration systems and certain reporting practices, there are many inaccuracies, particularly in undeveloped nations, in the statistics of the number of infants dying. In developing nations, access to vital registries, and other government-run systems which record births and deaths, is difficult for poor families for several reasons. These struggles force stress on families, and make them take drastic measures in unofficial death ceremonies for their deceased infants. As a result, government statistics will inaccurately reflect a nation's infant mortality rate. UNICEF uses a statistical methodology to account for reporting differences among countries:\n\nAnother challenge to comparability is the practice of counting frail or premature infants who die before the normal due date as miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) or those who die during or immediately after childbirth as stillborn. This point is reinforced by the demographer Ansley Coale, who finds dubiously high ratios of reported stillbirths to infant deaths in Hong Kong and Japan in the first 24 hours after birth, a pattern that is consistent with the high recorded sex ratios at birth in those countries. This is mainly because improvement in access to medical care is often accompanied by improvement in the registration of births and deaths. The country-to-country variation in child mortality rates is huge, and growing wider despite the progress. For the United States, the rate is eight per 1,000 births. Infant mortality rate (IMR) is not only a group of statistic but instead it is a reflection of the socioeconomic development and effectively represents the presence of medical services in the countries. Many countries, including the United States, Sweden and Germany, count an infant exhibiting any sign of life as alive, no matter the month of gestation or the size, but according to United States some other countries differ in these practices. However, in 2009, the US CDC issued a report that stated that the American rates of infant mortality were affected by the United States' high rates of premature babies compared to European countries. However, the differences in reporting are unlikely to be the primary explanation for the high rate of infant mortality in the United States' compared with its peer countries at a similar level of economic development. Although such extremely premature infants typically accounted for only about 0.5% of all live-born children, their exclusion from both the numerator and the denominator in the reported IMR led to an estimated 22%–25% lower reported IMR. In some cases, too, perhaps because hospitals or regional health departments were held accountable for lowering the IMR in their catchment area, infant deaths that occurred in the 12th month were \"transferred\" statistically to the 13th month (i.e., the second year of life), and thus no longer classified as an infant death. Access to vital registry systems for infant births and deaths is an extremely difficult and expensive task for poor parents living in rural areas. Little has been done to address the underlying structural problems of the vital registry systems in respect to the lack of reporting from parents in rural areas, and in turn has created a gap between the official and popular meanings of child death. It is also argued that the bureaucratic separation of vital death recording from cultural death rituals is to blame for the inaccuracy of the infant mortality rate (IMR). Vital death registries often fail to recognize the cultural implications and importance of infant deaths. Many regions may benefit from \"popular death reporters\" who are culturally linked to infants may be able to provide more accurate statistics on the incidence of infant mortality. By combining the methods of household surveys, vital registries, and asking \"popular death reporters\" this can increase the validity of child mortality rates, but there are many barriers that can reflect the validity of our statistics of infant mortality. One of these barriers are political economic decisions. The bureaucratic separation of vital death reporting and cultural death rituals stems in part due to structural violence. Similar to the lack of birth reporting, families in rural Brazil face difficult choices based on already existing structural arrangements when choosing to report infant mortality. According to the State of the World's Mothers report by Save the Children, the world IMR declined from 126 in 1960 to 57 in 2001. United States\n\nOf the 27 most developed countries, the U.S. has the highest Infant Mortality Rate, despite spending much more on health care per capita. However, more studies have been conducted around this matter, and the largest advancement is around the idea of stress and how it affects pregnancy. This declining rate has been mainly due to modern improvements in basic health care, technology, and medical advances. In the last century, the infant mortality rate has decreased by 93%. Overall, the rates have decreased drastically from 20 deaths in 1970 to 6.9 deaths in 2003 (per every 1000 live births). In 2003, the leading causes of infant mortality in the United States were congenital anomalies, disorders related to immaturity, AIDS, and maternal complications. Babies born with low birth weight increased to 8.1% while cigarette smoking during pregnancy declined to 10.2%. This reflected the amount of low birth weights concluding that 12.4% of births from smokers were low birth weights compared with 7.7% of such births from non-smokers. According to the New York Times, \"the main reason for the high rate is preterm delivery, and there was a 10% increase in such births from 2000 to 2006.\" Between 2007 and 2011, however, the preterm birth rate has decreased every year. Despite this spending, several reports state that infant mortality rate in the United States is significantly higher than in other developed nations. A study in North Carolina, for example, concluded that \"white women who did not complete high school have a lower infant mortality rate than black college graduates.\" According to Mustillo's CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study, \"self reported experiences of racial discrimination were associated with pre-term and low-birthweight deliveries, and such experiences may contribute to black-white disparities in prenatal outcomes.\" African American \nWhile earlier parts of this article have addressed the racial differences in infant deaths, a closer look into the effects of racial differences within the country is necessary to view discrepancies. Non-Hispanic Black women lead all other racial groups in IMR with a rate of 11.3, while the Infant Mortality Rate among white women is 5.1. While the popular argument leads to the idea that due to the trend of a lower socio-economic status had by black women there is in an increased likelihood of a child suffering. Some believe black women are predisposed to a higher IMR, meaning ancestrally speaking, all black women from African descent should experience an elevated rate. This theory is quickly disproven by looking at women of African descent who have immigrated to the United States. She claims African American women experience stress at much higher rates than any other group in the country. Stress produces particular hormones that induce labor and contribute to other pregnancy problems. Considering early births are one of the leading causes of death of infants under the age of one, induced labor is a very legitimate factor. The idea of stress spans socio-economic status as Parker Dominguez claims stress for lower-class women comes from unstable family life and chronic worry over poverty. She claims constantly dealing with disadvantages and racial prejudice causes black women's birth outcomes to deteriorate with age. Racism, economic disparities, and sexism in segregated communities are all examples of the daily stressors that pregnant black women face that can affect their pregnancies with conditions such as pre-eclampsia and hypertension. Studies have also shown that high IMR is due to the inadequate care that pregnant African Americans receive compared to other women in the country. This unequal treatment stems from the idea that there are racial medical differences and is also rooted in racial biases and controlled images of black women. Because of this unequal treatment, research on maternal and prenatal care received by African American women and their infants, finds that black women do not receive the same urgency in medical care; they are also not taken as seriously regarding pain they feel or complications they think they are having, as exemplified by the complications tennis-star Serena Williams faced during her delivery. When examined through this lens, the increased rates of IMR of African American women becomes a matter of equity and an issue of social justice. Following this theory, if institutional inequalities are addresses and repaired by the United States Government, daily stressors for African Americans, and African American women in particular, will be reduced, therefore lessening the risk of complications in pregnancy and infant mortality. Another more recent form of action to reduce high IMR amongst black children is the use of doulas throughout pregnancy. With this program, they were able to lower the IMR to 10 deaths rather than 100 deaths per every 1000 births. Medical professionals helped further the cause for infant health by creating a pediatrics field that was experienced in medicine for children. United States\nDecreases in infant mortality in given countries across the world during the 20th century have been linked to several common trends, scientific advancements, and social programs. Some of these include the state improving sanitation, improving access to healthcare, improving education, and the development of medical advancements such as penicillin, and safer blood transfusions. In the United States, improving infant mortality in the early half of the 20th century meant tackling environmental factors. On top of these environmental factors, during this time the United States endeavored to increase education and awareness regarding infant mortality. These factors, on top of a general increase in the standard of living for those living in urban settings, helped the United States make dramatic improvements in their rates of infant mortality in the early 20th century. In the latter half of the 20th century, a focus on greater access to medical care for women spurred declines in infant mortality in the United States. In the decades following the 1970s, the United States' decreasing infant mortality rates began to slow, falling behind China's, Cuba's, and other developed countries'. This change in medical systems caused a socio-economic gap in accessibility to medical care in China, which fortunately was not reflected in its infant mortality rate of decline. China's one-child policy, adopted in the 1980s, negatively impacted its infant mortality. Women carrying unapproved pregnancies faced state consequences and social stigma and were thus less likely to use prenatal care. Additionally, economic realities and long-held cultural factors incentivized male offspring, leading some families who already had sons to avoid prenatal care or professional delivery services, and causing China to have unusually high female infant mortality rates during this time.

The WHO lists the leading causes of maternal death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. These causes compose approximately 80 percent of all maternal mortalities worldwide with the vast majority occurring in developing countries. The other remaining factors that contribute to maternal death include malaria, anemia, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The WHO also states that the reasons why so many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. All of these causes of maternal death, and the corresponding reasons, are very familiar among women in Angola. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today include pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions (including peripartum cardiomyopathy), and ectopic pregnancy. These causes can be attributed to various factors, such as pre-existing medical conditions, complications during pregnancy or childbirth, and inadequate access to healthcare services. It is worth noting that the maternal mortality rate in the United States, while relatively low compared to some countries, still represents a public health concern. Taking measures to address disparities in healthcare access and focusing on improving overall maternal healthcare can contribute to further reductions in the maternal mortality rate. Maternal death is defined as death occurring during pregnancy or within 42 days of completion of pregnancy from a cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy, but not due to accident or incidental causes. From 1935 to 2007, the U.S. maternal death rate decreased from nearly 600/100,000 births to 12.7/100,000 births. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today are pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions (including peripartum cardiomyopathy), and ectopic pregnancy. As stated above, the maternal mortality rate in the United States is about 12.7/100,00 births. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, the maternal mortality rate is about 500/100,000 live births. The most common cause of maternal death in these countries is maternal hemorrhage. The high maternal death rates are due in part to inadequate contraceptive and family-planning services, an insufficient number of skilled birth attendants, and difficulty in accessing birthing centers and emergency obstetrical care units.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": " According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, about 9,200 women are dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions. According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or child mortality. While women in the United States tend to live longer than men, they generally are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more \n\nInfant mortality is the death of young children under the age of 1. This death toll is measured by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which is the probability of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births. One of the most common preventable causes of infant mortality is smoking during pregnancy. Lack of prenatal care, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and drug use also cause complications which may result in infant mortality. Many environmental factors contribute to infant mortality, such as the mother's level of education, environmental conditions, and political and medical infrastructure. Improving sanitation, access to clean drinking water, immunization against infectious diseases, and other public health measures can help reduce high rates of infant mortality. More than 60% of these deaths are seen as being avoidable with low-cost measures such as continuous breast-feeding, vaccinations and improved nutrition. The child mortality rate, but not the infant mortality rate, was an indicator used to monitor progress towards the Fourth Goal of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations for the year 2015. Throughout the world, infant mortality rate (IMR) fluctuates drastically, and according to Biotechnology and Health Sciences, education and life expectancy in the country is the leading indicator of IMR. Classification\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. Forms of infant mortality:\n Perinatal mortality is late fetal death (22 weeks gestation to birth), or death of a newborn up to one week postpartum. This accounts for 40–60% of infant mortality in developing countries. The major contributors to postneonatal death are malnutrition, infectious disease, troubled pregnancy, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and problems with the home environment. Causes \nCauses of infant mortality directly lead to the death. Environmental and social barriers prevent access to basic medical resources and thus contribute to an increasing infant mortality rate; 99% of infant deaths occur in developing countries, and 86% of these deaths are due to infections, premature births, complications during delivery, and perinatal asphyxia and birth injuries. In the United States, a primary determinant of infant mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk of infant mortality. Medicine and biology \nCauses of infant mortality and deaths that are related to medical conditions include: low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, malnutrition, congenital malformations, and infectious diseases, low income for health care including neglected tropical diseases. Lower gestational age increases the risk of infant mortality. Premature birth can be either spontaneous, or medically induced. Despite these risk factors, the underlying causes of premature infant death are often unknown and approximately 65% of all cases are not associated with any known risk factor. While the exact mechanisms responsible for inducing premature birth are often unknown, many of the underlying risk factors are associated with inflammation. Approximately \"80% preterm births that occur at <1000 g or at <28 to 30 weeks of gestation\" have been associated with inflammation. This disease is more common in Western countries. So much so, the United States Center for Disease Control reports Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to be the leading cause of death in infants age 1 month to 1 year of life. In more developed countries such as the United States, there was a rise in infant deaths due to congenital malformations. In the 19th century, there was a decrease in the number of infant deaths from heart diseases. From 1979 to 1997, there was a 39% decline in infant mortality due to heart problems. Low birth weight \n\nLow birth weight makes up 60–80% of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. The New England Journal of Medicine stated that \"The lowest mortality rates occur among infants weighing . For infants born weighing  or less, the mortality rate rapidly increases with decreasing weight, and most of the infants weighing  or less die. As compared with normal-birth-weight infants, those with low weight at birth are almost 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; for infants with very low weight at birth the relative risk of neonatal death is almost 200 times greater.\" Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually a direct cause stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of prenatal care, maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environments. Along with birth weight, period of gestation makes up the two most important predictors of an infant's chances of survival and their overall health. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, \"in the past two decades, the infant mortality rate (deaths under one year of age per thousand live births) in the United States has declined sharply.\" Low birth weights from African American mothers remain twice as high as that of white women. Although it is preventable, the solutions may not be the easiest but effective programs to help prevent LBW are a combination of health care, education, environment, mental modification and public policy, influencing a culture supporting lifestyle. Even though America excels past many other countries in the care and saving of premature infants, the percentage of American woman who deliver prematurely is comparable to those in developing countries. Also, women who do not have access to health care are less likely to visit a doctor, therefore increasing their risk of delivering prematurely. It is especially prevalent in women and infants under 5 who live in developing countries within the poorer regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It is difficult to assess the most pressing factor as they can intertwine and vary among regions. Such characteristics entail difference in weight-and-height ratios for age in comparison to adequate standards. The mother may not be aware of the infection, or she may have an untreated pelvic inflammatory disease or sexually transmitted disease. Seven out of ten childhood deaths are due to infectious diseases: acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, measles, and malaria. Specifically, air pollution is highly associated with SIDs in the United States during the post-neonatal stage. High infant mortality is exacerbated because newborns are a vulnerable subgroup that is affected by air pollution. Women who are exposed to greater air pollution on a daily basis who are pregnant should be closely watched by their doctors, as well as after the baby is born. As expected, babies who live in environments with more air pollution are at greater risk for infant mortality. The key pollutant for infant mortality rates is carbon monoxide. Among women having their second or higher birth, smokers experienced 30% greater mortality than nonsmokers.\" Modern research in the United States on racial disparities in infant mortality suggests a link between the institutionalized racism that pervades the environment and high rates of African American infant mortality. In synthesis of this research, it has been observed that \"African American infant mortality remains elevated due to the social arrangements that exist between groups and the lifelong experiences responding to the resultant power dynamics of these arrangements.\" It is important to note that infant mortality rates do not decline among African Americans even if their socio-economic status does improve. Stress is a lead factor in inducing labor in pregnant women, and therefore high levels of stress during pregnancy could lead to premature births that have the potential to be fatal for the infant. Early childhood trauma\nEarly childhood trauma includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of a child ages zero to five years-old. Trauma in early development has extreme impact over the course of a lifetime and is a significant contributor to infant mortality. There is a direct relationship between age of maltreatment/injury and risk for death. The younger an infant is, the more dangerous the maltreatment. Family configuration, child gender, social isolation, lack of support, maternal youth, marital status, poverty, parental ACES, and parenting practices are thought to contribute to increased risk. Socio-economic factors\n\nSocial class is a major factor in infant mortality, both historically and today. In cases where the father had no income, the rate of infant mortality was 357% more than that for the highest income earners ($1,250+). African-American mothers experience infant mortality at a rate 44% higher than average; however, research indicates that socio-economic factors do not totally account for the racial disparities in infant mortality. While infant mortality is normally negatively correlated with GDP, there may indeed be some opposing short-term effects from a recession. A recent study by The Economist showed that economic slowdowns reduce the amount of air pollution, which results in a lower infant mortality rate. It is only during deep recessions that infant mortality increases. According to Norbert Schady and Marc-François Smitz, recessions when GDP per capita drops by 15% or more increase infant mortality. Social class dictates which medical services are available to an individual. Developed countries, most notably the United States, have seen a divergence between those living in poverty who cannot afford medical advanced resources, leading to an increased chance of infant mortality, and others. Levels of socioeconomic development and global integration are inversely related to a nation's infant mortality rate. If the nation's ability to raise its own revenues is compromised, governments will lose funding for its health service programs, including services that aim in decreasing infant mortality rates. Even with a strong economy and economic growth (measured by a country's gross national product), the advances of medical technologies may not be felt by everyone, lending itself to increasing social disparities. Infant mortality rates correlate with war, political unrest, and government corruption. However, many other significant factors influence infant mortality rates in war-torn areas. Health care systems in developing countries in the midst of war often collapse. Attaining basic medical supplies and care becomes increasingly difficult. Expecting mothers are affected even more by lack of access to food and water. Women who become pregnant as a result of war rape face even more significant challenges in bearing a healthy child. Causes of infant mortality in abused women range from physical side effects of the initial trauma to psychological effects that lead to poor adjustment to society. Culture \nHigh rates of infant mortality occur in developing countries where financial and material resources are scarce and there is a high tolerance to high number of infant deaths. There are circumstances where a number of developing countries to breed a culture where situations of infant mortality such as favoring male babies over female babies are the norm. In developing countries such as Brazil, infant mortality rates are commonly not recorded due to failure to register for death certificates. Another cultural reason for infant mortality, such as what is happening in Ghana, is that \"besides the obvious, like rutted roads, there are prejudices against wives or newborns leaving the house.\" Because of this it is making it even more difficult for the women and newborns to get the treatment that is available to them and that is needed. Cultural influences and lifestyle habits in the United States can account for some deaths in infants throughout the years. All are possible causes of premature births, which constitute the second highest cause of infant mortality. Male sex favoritism\nHistorically, males have had higher infant mortality rates than females. The difference between male and female infant mortality rates have been dependent on environmental, social, and economic conditions. More specifically, males are biologically more vulnerable to infections and conditions associated with prematurity and development. Before 1970, the reasons for male infant mortality were due to infections, and chronic degenerative diseases. However, since 1970, certain cultures emphasizing males has led to a decrease in the infant mortality gap between males and females. Also, medical advances have resulted in a growing number of male infants surviving at higher rates than females due to the initial high infant mortality rate of males. As infant mortality rates saw a decrease on a global scale, the gender most affected by infant mortality changed from males experiences a biological disadvantage, to females facing a societal disadvantage. Births spaced at least three years apart from one another are associated with the lowest rate of mortality. The longer the interval between births, the lower the risk for having any birthing complications, and infant, childhood and maternal mortality. Higher rates of pre-term births, and low birth weight are associated with birth to conception intervals of less than six months and abortion to pregnancy interval of less than six months. Shorter intervals between births increase the chances of chronic and general under-nutrition; 57% of women in 55 developing countries reported birth spaces shorter than three years; 26% report birth spacing of less than two years. Only 20% of post-partum women report wanting another birth within two years; however, only 40% are taking necessary steps such as family planning to achieve the birth intervals they want. Unplanned pregnancies and birth intervals of less than twenty-four months are known to correlate with low birth weights and delivery complications. Also, women who are already small in stature tend to deliver smaller than average babies, perpetuating a cycle of being underweight. Prevention and outcomes\nTo reduce infant mortality rates across the world, health practitioners, governments, and non-governmental organizations have worked to create institutions, programs and policies to generate better health outcomes. Governments can reduce the mortality rates by addressing the combined need for education (such as universal primary education), nutrition, and access to basic maternal and infant health services. Reducing chances of babies being born at low birth weights and contracting pneumonia can be accomplished by improving air quality. Overall, women's health status need to remain high. Focusing on preventing preterm and low birth weight deliveries throughout all populations can help to eliminate cases of infant mortality and decrease health care disparities within communities. In the United States, these two goals have decreased infant mortality rates on a regional population, it has yet to see further progress on a national level. Increasing human resources such as physicians, nurses, and other health professionals will increase the number of skilled attendants and the number of people able to give out immunized against diseases such as measles. Increasing the number of skilled professionals is negatively correlated with maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. In certain parts of the U.S., specific modern programs aim to reduce levels of infant mortality. Prenatal care and maternal health \nWhen a woman becomes pregnant, certain steps can help to reduce the chance of complications during the pregnancy. Attending regular prenatal care check-ups will help improve the baby's chances of being delivered in safer conditions and surviving. Pregnant women should consult with their doctors to best manage any existing health conditions that they have to avoid complications of both their health as well as the fetus. Additionally, they are more likely to experience a pre-term birth or have a child with birth defects. For this reason, breast feeding is favored over formula feeding by healthcare professionals. As aforementioned in a previous section, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is the leading cause of infant mortality for those 1 month of age to 1 year of age. Socio-economic factors\nIt has been well documented that increased education among mothers, communities, and local health workers results in better family planning, improvement on children's health, and lower rates of children's deaths. Awareness of health services, education, and economic opportunities provide means to sustain and increase chance of development and survival. A decrease in GDP, for example, results in increased rates of infant mortality. Negative effects on household income reduces amount being spent on food and healthcare, affecting the quality of life and access to medical services to ensure full development and survival. Differences in measurement\n\nThe infant mortality rate correlates very strongly with, and is among the best predictors of, state failure. However, the method of calculating IMR often varies widely between countries and is based on how they define a live birth and how many premature infants are born in the country. Reporting of infant mortality rates can be inconsistent, and may be understated, depending on a nation's live birth criterion, vital registration system, and reporting practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a live birth as any infant born demonstrating independent signs of life, including breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation or definite movement of voluntary muscles. France) and Japan, only count as live births cases where an infant breathes at birth, which makes their reported IMR numbers somewhat lower and increases their rates of perinatal mortality. Although many countries have vital registration systems and certain reporting practices, there are many inaccuracies, particularly in undeveloped nations, in the statistics of the number of infants dying. In developing nations, access to vital registries, and other government-run systems which record births and deaths, is difficult for poor families for several reasons. These struggles force stress on families, and make them take drastic measures in unofficial death ceremonies for their deceased infants. As a result, government statistics will inaccurately reflect a nation's infant mortality rate. UNICEF uses a statistical methodology to account for reporting differences among countries:\n\nAnother challenge to comparability is the practice of counting frail or premature infants who die before the normal due date as miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) or those who die during or immediately after childbirth as stillborn. This point is reinforced by the demographer Ansley Coale, who finds dubiously high ratios of reported stillbirths to infant deaths in Hong Kong and Japan in the first 24 hours after birth, a pattern that is consistent with the high recorded sex ratios at birth in those countries. This is mainly because improvement in access to medical care is often accompanied by improvement in the registration of births and deaths. The country-to-country variation in child mortality rates is huge, and growing wider despite the progress. For the United States, the rate is eight per 1,000 births. Infant mortality rate (IMR) is not only a group of statistic but instead it is a reflection of the socioeconomic development and effectively represents the presence of medical services in the countries. Many countries, including the United States, Sweden and Germany, count an infant exhibiting any sign of life as alive, no matter the month of gestation or the size, but according to United States some other countries differ in these practices. However, in 2009, the US CDC issued a report that stated that the American rates of infant mortality were affected by the United States' high rates of premature babies compared to European countries. However, the differences in reporting are unlikely to be the primary explanation for the high rate of infant mortality in the United States' compared with its peer countries at a similar level of economic development. Although such extremely premature infants typically accounted for only about 0.5% of all live-born children, their exclusion from both the numerator and the denominator in the reported IMR led to an estimated 22%–25% lower reported IMR. In some cases, too, perhaps because hospitals or regional health departments were held accountable for lowering the IMR in their catchment area, infant deaths that occurred in the 12th month were \"transferred\" statistically to the 13th month (i.e., the second year of life), and thus no longer classified as an infant death. Access to vital registry systems for infant births and deaths is an extremely difficult and expensive task for poor parents living in rural areas. Little has been done to address the underlying structural problems of the vital registry systems in respect to the lack of reporting from parents in rural areas, and in turn has created a gap between the official and popular meanings of child death. It is also argued that the bureaucratic separation of vital death recording from cultural death rituals is to blame for the inaccuracy of the infant mortality rate (IMR). Vital death registries often fail to recognize the cultural implications and importance of infant deaths. Many regions may benefit from \"popular death reporters\" who are culturally linked to infants may be able to provide more accurate statistics on the incidence of infant mortality. By combining the methods of household surveys, vital registries, and asking \"popular death reporters\" this can increase the validity of child mortality rates, but there are many barriers that can reflect the validity of our statistics of infant mortality. One of these barriers are political economic decisions. The bureaucratic separation of vital death reporting and cultural death rituals stems in part due to structural violence. Similar to the lack of birth reporting, families in rural Brazil face difficult choices based on already existing structural arrangements when choosing to report infant mortality. According to the State of the World's Mothers report by Save the Children, the world IMR declined from 126 in 1960 to 57 in 2001. United States\n\nOf the 27 most developed countries, the U.S. has the highest Infant Mortality Rate, despite spending much more on health care per capita. However, more studies have been conducted around this matter, and the largest advancement is around the idea of stress and how it affects pregnancy. This declining rate has been mainly due to modern improvements in basic health care, technology, and medical advances. In the last century, the infant mortality rate has decreased by 93%. Overall, the rates have decreased drastically from 20 deaths in 1970 to 6.9 deaths in 2003 (per every 1000 live births). In 2003, the leading causes of infant mortality in the United States were congenital anomalies, disorders related to immaturity, AIDS, and maternal complications. Babies born with low birth weight increased to 8.1% while cigarette smoking during pregnancy declined to 10.2%. This reflected the amount of low birth weights concluding that 12.4% of births from smokers were low birth weights compared with 7.7% of such births from non-smokers. According to the New York Times, \"the main reason for the high rate is preterm delivery, and there was a 10% increase in such births from 2000 to 2006.\" Between 2007 and 2011, however, the preterm birth rate has decreased every year. Despite this spending, several reports state that infant mortality rate in the United States is significantly higher than in other developed nations. A study in North Carolina, for example, concluded that \"white women who did not complete high school have a lower infant mortality rate than black college graduates.\" According to Mustillo's CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study, \"self reported experiences of racial discrimination were associated with pre-term and low-birthweight deliveries, and such experiences may contribute to black-white disparities in prenatal outcomes.\" African American \nWhile earlier parts of this article have addressed the racial differences in infant deaths, a closer look into the effects of racial differences within the country is necessary to view discrepancies. Non-Hispanic Black women lead all other racial groups in IMR with a rate of 11.3, while the Infant Mortality Rate among white women is 5.1. While the popular argument leads to the idea that due to the trend of a lower socio-economic status had by black women there is in an increased likelihood of a child suffering. Some believe black women are predisposed to a higher IMR, meaning ancestrally speaking, all black women from African descent should experience an elevated rate. This theory is quickly disproven by looking at women of African descent who have immigrated to the United States. She claims African American women experience stress at much higher rates than any other group in the country. Stress produces particular hormones that induce labor and contribute to other pregnancy problems. Considering early births are one of the leading causes of death of infants under the age of one, induced labor is a very legitimate factor. The idea of stress spans socio-economic status as Parker Dominguez claims stress for lower-class women comes from unstable family life and chronic worry over poverty. She claims constantly dealing with disadvantages and racial prejudice causes black women's birth outcomes to deteriorate with age. Racism, economic disparities, and sexism in segregated communities are all examples of the daily stressors that pregnant black women face that can affect their pregnancies with conditions such as pre-eclampsia and hypertension. Studies have also shown that high IMR is due to the inadequate care that pregnant African Americans receive compared to other women in the country. This unequal treatment stems from the idea that there are racial medical differences and is also rooted in racial biases and controlled images of black women. Because of this unequal treatment, research on maternal and prenatal care received by African American women and their infants, finds that black women do not receive the same urgency in medical care; they are also not taken as seriously regarding pain they feel or complications they think they are having, as exemplified by the complications tennis-star Serena Williams faced during her delivery. When examined through this lens, the increased rates of IMR of African American women becomes a matter of equity and an issue of social justice. Following this theory, if institutional inequalities are addresses and repaired by the United States Government, daily stressors for African Americans, and African American women in particular, will be reduced, therefore lessening the risk of complications in pregnancy and infant mortality. Another more recent form of action to reduce high IMR amongst black children is the use of doulas throughout pregnancy. With this program, they were able to lower the IMR to 10 deaths rather than 100 deaths per every 1000 births. Medical professionals helped further the cause for infant health by creating a pediatrics field that was experienced in medicine for children. United States\nDecreases in infant mortality in given countries across the world during the 20th century have been linked to several common trends, scientific advancements, and social programs. Some of these include the state improving sanitation, improving access to healthcare, improving education, and the development of medical advancements such as penicillin, and safer blood transfusions. In the United States, improving infant mortality in the early half of the 20th century meant tackling environmental factors. On top of these environmental factors, during this time the United States endeavored to increase education and awareness regarding infant mortality. These factors, on top of a general increase in the standard of living for those living in urban settings, helped the United States make dramatic improvements in their rates of infant mortality in the early 20th century. In the latter half of the 20th century, a focus on greater access to medical care for women spurred declines in infant mortality in the United States. In the decades following the 1970s, the United States' decreasing infant mortality rates began to slow, falling behind China's, Cuba's, and other developed countries'. This change in medical systems caused a socio-economic gap in accessibility to medical care in China, which fortunately was not reflected in its infant mortality rate of decline. China's one-child policy, adopted in the 1980s, negatively impacted its infant mortality. Women carrying unapproved pregnancies faced state consequences and social stigma and were thus less likely to use prenatal care. Additionally, economic realities and long-held cultural factors incentivized male offspring, leading some families who already had sons to avoid prenatal care or professional delivery services, and causing China to have unusually high female infant mortality rates during this time.

The WHO lists the leading causes of maternal death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. These causes compose approximately 80 percent of all maternal mortalities worldwide with the vast majority occurring in developing countries. The other remaining factors that contribute to maternal death include malaria, anemia, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The WHO also states that the reasons why so many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. All of these causes of maternal death, and the corresponding reasons, are very familiar among women in Angola. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today include pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions (including peripartum cardiomyopathy), and ectopic pregnancy. These causes can be attributed to various factors, such as pre-existing medical conditions, complications during pregnancy or childbirth, and inadequate access to healthcare services. It is worth noting that the maternal mortality rate in the United States, while relatively low compared to some countries, still represents a public health concern. Taking measures to address disparities in healthcare access and focusing on improving overall maternal healthcare can contribute to further reductions in the maternal mortality rate. Maternal death is defined as death occurring during pregnancy or within 42 days of completion of pregnancy from a cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy, but not due to accident or incidental causes. From 1935 to 2007, the U.S. maternal death rate decreased from nearly 600/100,000 births to 12.7/100,000 births. The most common causes of maternal death in the United States today are pulmonary embolism, obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, cardiovascular conditions (including peripartum cardiomyopathy), and ectopic pregnancy. As stated above, the maternal mortality rate in the United States is about 12.7/100,00 births. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, the maternal mortality rate is about 500/100,000 live births. The most common cause of maternal death in these countries is maternal hemorrhage. The high maternal death rates are due in part to inadequate contraceptive and family-planning services, an insufficient number of skilled birth attendants, and difficulty in accessing birthing centers and emergency obstetrical care units.\n\n"

However, the study found that taking a short walk every hour, even at a slow pace, prevented this damage from occurring. The participants who engaged in the short walks experienced maintained blood flow and improved endothelial function, thereby preventing vascular damage. However, the findings suggest that even light-intensity physical activity like a short walk can have a protective effect against the negative impacts of sitting. To summarize, the regular 5-minute walks help to counteract the decline in blood flow and endothelial function caused by prolonged sitting, thus preventing vascular damage. These findings support the idea of having structured public health guidelines on limiting sitting time to promote better cardiovascular health. Try walking casually for as little as 2 minutes per hour. \"We know prolonged sitting is associated with poor [health] outcomes,\" Beddhu told Live Science. The study found that \"light-intensity activities,\" such as casual walking, are beneficial. In contrast, activities that are \"low intensity,\" such as standing or writing at a desk, aren't enough to provide any meaningful health benefits, the study found. In general, those who exercised more were less likely to die during the study period. The finding could be particularly beneficial for people with kidney disease, who tend to be sedentary and inactive throughout most of the day, Beddhu added. For instance, a finding published by researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2009 said that longer lengths of sitting were directly proportional to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease and most causes of death other than cancer. Walking around the home, however, reduced these risks. Due to the large size of leg muscles, walking, running, and cycling are the most effective means of exercise to reduce body fat. Exercise affects macronutrient balance. During moderate exercise, equivalent to a brisk walk, there is a shift to greater use of fat as a fuel.

Numerous studies have come out supporting the fact that sitting for long periods of time, or living a sedentary life, can contribute to many negative health effects. Sitting and chronic disease have largely been studied as of late, linking prolonged sitting to obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, cancer and even early death. This link was still evident in individuals who participated in vigorous physical activity, revealing that even intense exercise cannot fully protect us from the negative effects of sitting. In the latest findings researchers aimed to explore the link between sitting, physical activity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Physical activity and sitting were documented using questionnaires, and fatty liver was determined using ultrasonography. Sitting and a decrease in physical activity were independently associated with an increase of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Lead investigator Seungho Ryu said, “We found that prolonged sitting time and decreased physical activity level were positively associated with the prevalence of NAFLD in a large sample of middle-aged Koreans.” An effective means to combat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in those who sit for prolonged periods of time are to increase physical activity levels of individuals and minimize the time spent sitting. We are all sitting too much, but sitting for long periods of time is even worse in older adults. Whether we’re stuck in traffic or in front of the TV, the main message is that we need to get up and start moving more if we want to protect our livers – and our health in general. Take a walking break after or with your coffee break. In seniors who are over 65 it is estimated they spend over 10 hours a day sitting. Here are some tips for those over the age of 65 to minimize sitting time. In this position you can gently press your liver. Not sitting is the easiest way we can begin to improve our health. So become more mindful and conscience of your sedentary habits in order to prevent long hours sitting and to keep your liver healthy. Long bouts of sitting can have serious effects on blood flow that could increase risk of cardiovascular disease, but a new study proposes that lower extremity vascular damage can be prevented by walking as few as 5 minutes every hour—and not even at a particularly fast pace. In a study e-published ahead of print in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (abstract only available for free), researchers from Indiana University monitored the ways in which the superficial femoral artery reacted to 3 hours of sitting without leg movement, and compared those results with study participants who took 5-minute walks at 2 miles per hour every hour. What they found was that prolonged sitting does lead to a \"significant impairment\" in endothelial function, but that the short walks prevented the damage from taking place altogether. The study was limited to 12 nonsmoking men in their 20s who did not meet the physical activity guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and were not taking any anti-hypertensive, lipid lowering, or anti-diabetic medications. \"Uninterrupted sitting leads to a progressive decline in antegrade and mean shear rate and corresponding impairment in endothelial function,\" authors write. \"We can hypothesize that repeated bouts of prolonged sitting may contribute to vascular aging, at least in the lower extremities.\" But walking made all the difference. \"Even this very light-intensity physical activity prevented the decline … and may explain the protective effect against sitting-induced impairment,\" they write.

        "context": "According to a study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, prolonged sitting leads to a decline in blood flow and impairment in endothelial function, which can increase the risk of vascular damage and cardiovascular disease. However, the study found that taking a short walk every hour, even at a slow pace, prevented this damage from occurring. The participants who engaged in the short walks experienced maintained blood flow and improved endothelial function, thereby preventing vascular damage. However, the findings suggest that even light-intensity physical activity like a short walk can have a protective effect against the negative impacts of sitting. To summarize, the regular 5-minute walks help to counteract the decline in blood flow and endothelial function caused by prolonged sitting, thus preventing vascular damage. These findings support the idea of having structured public health guidelines on limiting sitting time to promote better cardiovascular health. Try walking casually for as little as 2 minutes per hour. \"We know prolonged sitting is associated with poor [health] outcomes,\" Beddhu told Live Science. The study found that \"light-intensity activities,\" such as casual walking, are beneficial. In contrast, activities that are \"low intensity,\" such as standing or writing at a desk, aren't enough to provide any meaningful health benefits, the study found. In general, those who exercised more were less likely to die during the study period. The finding could be particularly beneficial for people with kidney disease, who tend to be sedentary and inactive throughout most of the day, Beddhu added.

State Public Health Veterinarian Kelly Giesbrecht, DVM, MPH is the primary consultant in the state for rabies and other zoonotic diseases. Rabies control is provided by law in KRS 258.005-258.990 and under the state Communicable Disease Regulation 902KAR 2:070. What is rabies and how do people get it? In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Any physician or other attending medical service provider who treats or consults on an animal bite or scratch incident is required to make a report to the local health department within 12 hours. Call your veterinarian and local animal control. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Vaccination of all dogs, cats and ferrets on the premises protects them from the risk of rabies. Bats accounted for six of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1999. Rabies from bats is the most common source of human infection in the United States. It is best to have the animal in question medically euthanized, so the head and brain are not damaged. Contact your veterinarian or local animal control personnel for information. Your local health department has proper containers and instructions for submitting an animal specimen for rabies testing. Post-exposure prophylaxis is available to people who have been exposed to an animal that tested positive to rabies. Post-exposure prophylaxis is also available for people with a possible exposure to rabies virus, but the animal was not available for testing. Many countries have a much higher risk of rabies exposure than the United States. If you are traveling to a foreign country, consult your local health department about vaccination recommendations. In 1998, four cases of rabies in horses were confirmed in Kentucky. Approved rabies vaccines are available for dogs, cats, horses, cattle, sheep and ferrets. Animal rabies vaccines should be administered only by, or under the direct supervision of, a licensed veterinarian. Proper and up-to-date vaccination of your pets is your first line of defense against rabies. The causative agent of rabies refers to myxovirus. The rabies virus survives in freezing and in a rotting environment. Among the susceptible animals are cats . During the incubation period, there are no signs of rabies in cats . Baleen become contagious for 8-10 days before the first symptoms. In the body of an infected animal, the pathogen moves along neurons — cells of the nervous system. It is because of violations of its functions that the typical symptoms of rabies are manifested. With the first symptoms of rabid baleen, it’s not up to the kittens, moreover, parents can harm them. The first sign of rabies in cats can be left behind for months. However, in reality such cases are exceptional and belong to the third type of feline rabies. The abortive form of rabies is different and can occur both in a violent and atypical pattern. According to statistics, abortive rabies occurs in 2% of sick baleen. However, most of them die not from rabis, but from the hands of veterinarians. If 100% of baleen animals were given a chance to fight the disease to the last, it is possible that the fixed proportion of abortive rabies would increase. If you summarize the symptoms of different types of Rabies, the clinical picture may resemble cat plague. In patients with rabies may also be an upset stomach. They are taken for analysis, and the cat is quarantined. Not everyone is in a hurry to the veterinary clinic. Slow down owners of infected cats makes the same atypical way of infection. A cat may simply step on the physiological fluids of another animal. In this case, one can be suspicious only at the first symptoms of Rabies. However, given the survivability of Rabies, and it is dangerous. Is rabies treated in cats? 2% of the survivors of the abortive form versus 98% of those who died from the classic Rabies. The statistics are the same for cats, people, dogs, coyotes , raccoons , foxes, bats. Most common carriers of rabies are wild animals. Cat’s rabies can be cured only by blocking it at the beginning of the incubation stage. When taking a pet to a vet clinic, it is advisable to wash the bite with soap. What to do if your cat was bitten? Knowing how madness manifests itself , people rush to take the bitten cats to the veterinarians and place them in a clinic under quarantine. After the veterinary clinic, hurry to the infectious diseases hospital to provide emergency medical care to yourself. If there is no confidence in the offender, the cat should be taken to the veterinarians. What to do if a rabid cat bit a person? Meanwhile, the penetration of the sharp teeth of the cat is deep, and the saliva is crammed with harmful bacteria. This is considered the norm for cat bites. When you picture a rabid dog, you may imagine a canine foaming at the mouth and becoming aggressive. But those are only two of the symptoms of rabies, and they typically occur only after the dog displays subtler symptoms, says Susan Nelson, DVM, associate clinical professor at the Veterinary Health Center at Kansas State University. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), cats are more prone to becoming aggressive, while dogs are more likely to be lethargic and non-responsive. Sadly, once symptoms appear, the animal will likely die within 10 days. Thanks to the rabies vaccine , which is required in the United States for domestic dogs and cats, the canine variant of rabies has been eliminated from the United States, says Nelson. But that doesn’t mean your pets cannot get rabies from wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes. Cats are more likely to contract rabies because they are more prone to wandering outside unsupervised and are less likely to be vaccinated against the disease . “In 2008, the number of rabies-infected cats was almost four times the number of rabies-infected dogs,” writes the AVMA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that unvaccinated dogs, cats and ferrets thought to have been infected with rabies be euthanized. However, if owners do not want to do this and their jurisdiction will allow it, they are required to keep their pet in a state-approved isolation facility (typically at their expense) for six months. Pets that have expired vaccinations are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, according to the CDC. Pets that have been exposed to rabies and are up-to-date on vaccines must have the wound cleaned immediately and obtain another vaccine as soon as possible, as well as be put under observation for 45 days. Following this protocol ensures a nearly 100 percent survival rate in previously vaccinated pets, the AVMA says. Humans can also contract rabies, either from rabies-infected wild mammals or rabies-infected domestic pets. Most cases of rabies in humans in the United States come from bats, the AVMA says. Humans can contract rabies in the same ways as animals can. Once symptoms appear in humans, rabies is almost always fatal. Vaccination programs in domestic animals have been very effective in reducing and eliminating some variants of rabies in the United States and other developed countries. In 2008, 93 percent of rabies cases reported to the CDC were in wild animals and only 7 percent were in domestic animals. More than 55,000 people still die from rabies each year, mostly in Asia (80 percent of deaths) and Africa, where rabid dogs are very common. It’s very important to make sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations, which is required every one to three years, depending on the vaccine, according to the AVMA. While severe adverse reactions to vaccines do occur, Nelson says the benefits to you, your family, your pets and the public good far outweigh the risks. fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. They recommended thoroughly washing hands after handling a sick pet as it might be possible for cats to transmit the virus to humans. This was the third confirmed case of H1N1 in a cat in the U.S.; other cases have occurred in Utah and Iowa. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, the difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups was not large enough to be conclusive. The approved US FDA package insert for AVA contains the following notice: \"Pregnant women should not be vaccinated against anthrax unless the potential benefits of vaccination have been determined to outweigh the potential risk to the fetus. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\"\n\n"

The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. I held a newborn in my arms who had a severely deformed and tiny head, CRS. ​Congenital rubella can also occur when a newly pregnant woman or a woman about to get pregnant is given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The CDC warns that the MMR vaccine, “should not be administered to women known to be pregnant. Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source). ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit? Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits. Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are in a fast and furious race to develop another vaccine … against the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission \nIn response to the widespread transmission of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak and concerns of viral genetic material detected in breast milk the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Guideline of infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission, first in 2016 and updated in 2021, where the evidence showed that despite the detection of Zika virus in breast milk, there is unclear evidence of transmission to the infant, and considering that Zika virus infection among infants is mild, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Development was a priority of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but officials stated that development of a vaccine could take years. Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A 1954 study assessing blood samples from several people from different states found antibodies to Zika in healthy people in India which could indicate past exposure, though it could also be due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses. Before 2007, there were only 13 reported natural infections with Zika virus, all with a mild, self-limited febrile illness. Yap Islands \nThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. A total of 108 cases were confirmed by PCR or serology and 72 additional cases were suspected. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. Zika also appears to have an equal tropism for cells of the developing eye, leading to high rates of eye abnormalities as well. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells. A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses. Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and Zika). In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia.

Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and Zika). In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission \nIn response to the widespread transmission of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak and concerns of viral genetic material detected in breast milk the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Guideline of infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission, first in 2016 and updated in 2021, where the evidence showed that despite the detection of Zika virus in breast milk, there is unclear evidence of transmission to the infant, and considering that Zika virus infection among infants is mild, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Development was a priority of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but officials stated that development of a vaccine could take years. Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A 1954 study assessing blood samples from several people from different states found antibodies to Zika in healthy people in India which could indicate past exposure, though it could also be due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses. Before 2007, there were only 13 reported natural infections with Zika virus, all with a mild, self-limited febrile illness. Yap Islands \nThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. A total of 108 cases were confirmed by PCR or serology and 72 additional cases were suspected. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In February 2016, ocular disorders in newborns have been linked to Zika virus infection. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. Zika also appears to have an equal tropism for cells of the developing eye, leading to high rates of eye abnormalities as well. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells. A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses.

        "context": "Because health officials noticed an alarming spike in babies born with unusually small heads, a condition called microcephaly. ​When a new, devastating, and unexplained medical condition suddenly appears in large numbers like the microcephaly cases in Brazil, the first question any thinking person should ask is why? The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. I held a newborn in my arms who had a severely deformed and tiny head, CRS. ​Congenital rubella can also occur when a newly pregnant woman or a woman about to get pregnant is given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The CDC warns that the MMR vaccine, “should not be administered to women known to be pregnant. Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source). ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit? Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits. Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are in a fast and furious race to develop another vaccine … against the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease.

However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days.

A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses. Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and Zika). In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause\n\nReservoir \nZika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission \nIn response to the widespread transmission of Zika virus during the 2016 outbreak and concerns of viral genetic material detected in breast milk the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Guideline of infant feeding in areas of Zika virus transmission, first in 2016 and updated in 2021, where the evidence showed that despite the detection of Zika virus in breast milk, there is unclear evidence of transmission to the infant, and considering that Zika virus infection among infants is mild, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Development was a priority of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but officials stated that development of a vaccine could take years. Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A 1954 study assessing blood samples from several people from different states found antibodies to Zika in healthy people in India which could indicate past exposure, though it could also be due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses. Before 2007, there were only 13 reported natural infections with Zika virus, all with a mild, self-limited febrile illness. Yap Islands \nThe first major outbreak, with 185 confirmed cases, was reported in 2007 in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. A total of 108 cases were confirmed by PCR or serology and 72 additional cases were suspected. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. Zika also appears to have an equal tropism for cells of the developing eye, leading to high rates of eye abnormalities as well. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells.

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. If you've just learned that your child is visually impaired, you are probably trying to sort out how serious the problem is, where to get help, and what this means for your child's future.

This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe. If your child's visual impairment is severe, he or she may need help from other specialists to develop life skills.

CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them. Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed. At one end of the CVI continuum, there are children who are functionally blind and don’t appear to be able to “see” the world around them.

Another important aspect of visual perceptual difficulties, is that these issues are made worse when the environment around a person with these difficulties is cluttered. When children are diagnosed with certain impairments such as: ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder, tools and teaching strategies are implemented in the classroom to help ensure the child has the same opportunities to learn as his or her peers.

        "context": "Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), also known as Cerebral Visual Impairment, is a form of neurological blindness that affects the way children interpret visual information. While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences.

Rep. John Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high-quality health care plans designed to meet their unique needs as expatriates. Carney said that \"expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a \n\nSL is a 49-year-old Kenyan woman with kidney failure who has been dialysis dependent since 2002. She had come to Houston in 2001 on a visitor’s visa, with her husband and 2-year-old son. She became acutely ill during this visit and was initiated on dialysis. For now, SL waits patiently in the ED alongside 10–15 other similar patients, all of whom are hoping for one thing: a single dialysis treatment that day. Of the 12 million undocumented individuals living in the United States, an estimated 6500 individuals have kidney failure requiring chronic dialysis (1). Although for many patients dialysis is a bridge to transplantation, sadly, undocumented individuals are often excluded from transplantation despite the fact that several of them are excellent transplant candidates due to their better overall health, younger age, and available potential donors (3). Public policies to provide health care for noncitizens began with the Migrant Health Act, signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Currently, >1000 such centers provide comprehensive primary care to >20 million uninsured or undocumented individuals annually (4). Timeline of pertinent legislation and events related to dialysis-dependent undocumented immigrants. This singular act covering dialysis and kidney transplantation has led to longer and more productive lives for millions of Americans. Undocumented individuals, even those who may have contributed to social security, are excluded from this coverage. This amendment, passed in 1986 and referred to as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, requires that a patient who comes to an ED with an emergent medical condition be provided with treatment (such as dialysis) until stable or transferred to another hospital. It is under this provision that undocumented individuals have qualified for emergent dialysis (6). A major and disconcerting ethical quandary is the practice of emergent dialysis, which forces care providers into making difficult and unjustifiable ethical decisions, such as “who deserves treatment that day.” Nephrologists caring for this population advocate for their patients often by bending the rules or “working” the system (7). In some states, notably California, undocumented patients receive regularly scheduled dialysis treatments that are covered by state and matched by federal resources (Medicaid). California chooses to provide dialysis to the undocumented as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, also referred to as the Welfare Reform Act (Figure 1), the federal law that allows individual states to decide what outpatient services to provide noncitizens. In 2002 in Arizona, a trio of undocumented dialysis-dependent individuals filed suit to overturn a state policy that disallowed outpatient dialysis for undocumented individuals (Figure 1). A preliminary injunction was granted, and in 2007 Arizona restored its policy of providing regularly scheduled outpatient dialysis to undocumented individuals with kidney failure (8). The cost of patients receiving emergent dialysis in Houston is nearly four times more than those receiving scheduled dialysis: $285,000 versus $77,000 per year (9). Undocumented patients admitted to two safety-net hospitals in New York City to initiate dialysis incurred a 29% higher cost when compared with United States citizens admitted for the same reason (10). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services classifies such cases as superutilizers, defined as “a patient who accumulates large number of ED visits and hospital admissions which might have been prevented by relatively inexpensive early interventions and primary care.” From 2011 to 2012, 3% of superutilizers at the primary safety-net hospital in Denver, Colorado, accounted for 30% of total charges. In the absence of a federal policy to revise or reform the 1996 Welfare Reform Act or ratify comprehensive immigration reform, nearly all dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals will remain excluded from the standard avenues of care. Undocumented individuals are ineligible for all federal insurance programs because they are not legal residents or citizens of the United States. Approximately 29% of undocumented individuals acquire private health insurance through their employer. Of the four states with the most undocumented residents (California, Texas, Florida, and New York), Texas has the highest rate of uninsured undocumented individuals at 75%. Although there have never been federal regulations prohibiting the sale of private insurance to undocumented individuals, insurers previously denied those with certain chronic illnesses from purchasing a commercial insurance plan. It is this provision that made it possible for dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals to purchase insurance plans off the marketplace exchange. In general, this is prohibitively expensive for undocumented individuals, 40% of whom have annual incomes that are 138% below the Federal Poverty Level of <$16,000 for an individual or <$34,000 for a family of four. Nearly 81% of the undocumented individuals without health insurance are within this income range (12). Nearly all of the dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals with new off-exchange insurance plans qualify for charitable support from the AKF due to low income levels. If major insurance carriers deny patient assistance from third party payers, such as the AKF, this will have far-reaching consequences for thousands of patients on dialysis. This occurrence of undocumented dialysis-dependent individuals purchasing off-exchange insurance was first described in Illinois in 2014; and in conversations with nephrologists around the country, it occurs elsewhere but is neither widely publicized nor utilized (17). Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas and Harris Health in Houston represent the two largest safety-net hospital systems in Texas, and two of the five largest in the United States (18). Both cities have a large undocumented immigrant population and an already overburdened hospital system. In the Harris Health safety-net system, undocumented individuals account for 14% of total operating and up to 25% of uncompensated care costs (19). Since 2002, the average monthly census of emergent dialysis patients in Houston has been about 90 patients, who account for about 16 dialysis treatments and up to 15% of hospital admissions each day. During the 2015 open enrollment period (November of 2014 to February of 2015), >100 undocumented individuals dependent on emergent dialysis in Dallas purchased insurance off-exchange. In January of 2016, after learning of this policy, >30 undocumented emergent dialysis-dependent individuals in Houston, including SL, were enrolled in the same plan. Because open enrollment typically occurs between November and February, all remaining emergent dialysis patients as well as new undocumented patients that commence dialysis in 2016 will only receive emergent treatments until the 2017 open enrollment period. The significant reduction in blood transfusions, ED visits, and days admitted represent major cost savings to the county hospital system. In his own words, “Tengo mucha más energía. The purchase of off-exchange plans by undocumented individuals to cover dialysis services is a novel and creative solution to the national problem but is susceptible to market changes. Undocumented individuals in Texas have been able to purchase insurance because enrollment in these specific plans did not require any of the following documentation: a valid work visa, passport, or social security number. For example, in 2015, the off-exchange policy purchased by the undocumented patients in Dallas was a Preferred Provider Organization plan. Vigilance and creativity by dialysis facility administrators and social workers are essential for the continued coverage of these new plans. Two examples from personal experience that threaten sustainability of this option for the undocumented population are: (1) the policies of nine of the 32 Houston patients did not begin to pay for dialysis treatments until 3 months after the enrollment date, hence, the dialysis center absorbed the cost during this time; and (2) if the premiums were not received by the insurance company due to third party processing delays or the patient retaining the money and not sending payment, the policy was terminated. For now, this has been a life-changing experience for these patients who describe feeling like they are “en un sueno” (in a dream) from which they are afraid to wake up. Finally, there is concern over undocumented patients’ continued purchase of commercial plans to receive scheduled dialysis, particularly if dialysis centers and hospital systems currently providing charity or Medicaid-funded treatments decide to coerce their undocumented patients to obtain private coverage. One solution that has been proposed to this eventuality in California is the creation of a separate exchange specifically for undocumented individuals (22). The answer to these concerns is the reason for an urgent, sustainable solution to this national problem. The United States is a nation of immigrants. Undocumented individuals are members of the community in which they live and there is a moral and fiscal obligation to provide them with adequate health care. As our nation scrutinizes its health care system and wrestles with immigration reform, the care of undocumented individuals with chronic diseases epitomizes the crux of the proposed national agendas. The burden has traditionally been shouldered by hospital systems in large cities, particularly those in close proximity to our southern border. Without a path to citizenship and by exclusion from the ACA marketplace exchanges, undocumented individuals have limited options. Herein, the novel ability to purchase private insurance off the marketplace exchange shifts costs away from overburdened hospital systems and provides a more humane way to treat dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals. The Texas experience has alleviated serious ethical dilemmas; it has been positive and rewarding to both patients and nephrologists.

The healthcare reform debate in the United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. In the next administration, President Trump said the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform:\n\n repeal Obamacare\n reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance\n institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals\n make Health Saving Accounts inheritable\n require price transparency\n block-grant Medicaid to the states\n allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers\n\nHe also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from a household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. The United States has the lowest life expectancy overall and the infant mortality rate is the highest and in some cases twice as high when compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Cost and efficiency\n\nThe United States spends a higher proportion of its GDP on healthcare (19%) than any other country in the world, except for East Timor (Timor-Leste). Proponents of healthcare reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal healthcare argue that the need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends to drive up costs, leading to more expensive provision. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on healthcare with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, “that kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.”\n\nAllegations of waste\n\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of healthcare spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud. Ideas for reform\n\nDuring a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" Insurance reforms\nThe debate has involved certain insurance industry practices such as the placing of caps on coverage, the high level of co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called \"Cadillac policies\") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. Democratic legislators have largely supported the proposed reform efforts, while Republicans have criticized the government option or expanded regulation of healthcare. Tax reform\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has also described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:\n\nIn November 2009, The Economist estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical pre-existing conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions. Palin's death panel remarks were based on the ideas of Betsy McCaughey. During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against alleged rationing, referring to what by her interpretation was a \"downright evil\" \"death panel\" in current reform legislation known as H.R. However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and advance directives for patients in 2008. Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation H.R. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who sponsored the H.R. Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who co-sponsored a 2007 end-of-life counseling provision, called the euthanasia claim \"nuts\". According to TIME and ABC, Palin and Betsy McCaughey made false euthanasia claims. The federal requirement that hospitals help patients with things like living wills began when Republican George H. W. Bush was President. Slate columnist Christopher Beam used the term \"deathers\" to refer to those who believed rationing and euthanasia would become likely for senior citizens. The Rachel Maddow Show aired a program called \"Obama and the Deathers\" in which Maddow discussed conspiracy theories that included \"a secret plot to kill old people.\" Daily Kos and other web sites had used the term for about a week before Hari Sevugan, national spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, sent out an email with the subject line \"Murkowski: Deathers 'Lying' 'Inciting Fear.'\" The message included an article about a town hall statement by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, that no version of healthcare reform included \"death panels\". Sevugan explained the term \"deathers\" to Patricia Murphy, who used to write a Politics Daily column called \"The Capitolist\":\n\nBy \"deather,\" I mean an opponent of change who is knowingly spreading false information regarding the existence of an alleged \"death panel\" in health insurance reform plans despite the fact the claim has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by independent fact-checking organizations. Like \"birthers\", \"deathers\" are shamefully lying and trafficking in scurrilous rumors to incite fear and achieve their stated political objective of derailing the president of the United States. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform is not part of the bills under consideration: \"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. Addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses and hospital capacity\nThe U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Only four OECD countries have fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than the U.S, which has 2.7 per 1,000 population versus an OECD average of 3.8. Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\" Canada's system is largely publicly funded. Advocates argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Opponents argue that switching to a single-payer system would create more problems and setbacks. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will. Privatize Medicare with a voucher system\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. Congressional Proposals for Health Care Reform\n\nOn November 7, 2009, the House passed their version of a health insurance reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, 220–215, but this did not become law. Republicans continue to claim that they had a workable bill to extend coverage to all Americans and not cost the taxpayer anything, though nothing has been publicly presented to back the claim. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills. Similarities between the House and Senate Bills\nThe two bills are similar in a number of ways. In particular, both bills:\n Mandate minimum health insurance benefits for most Americans\n Remove insurer set annual and lifetime caps on coverage and limit co-pay amounts\n Remove co-pays on certain services such as health screenings and some vaccinations\n Impose a new excise tax on medical devices and drugs, including vaccines (the federal government began taxing vaccines in 1987). Establish health insurance exchanges making easier price and coverage comparisons and purchasing for people and small businesses buying health care coverage\n Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards\n Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions\n Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums\n Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums\n Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on\n Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage\n Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)\n Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance\n Impose a penalty on employers who do not offer health insurance to their workers\n Impose a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance (except American Indians (currently covered by the Indian Health Service), people with religious objections and people who can show financial hardship)\n Provide health insurance assistance subsidies for those earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level that must buy insurance for themselves\n Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program\n Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called Medicare Advantage plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments , reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices , cutting other Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance. Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs. Differences in the House and Senate Bills\nThe biggest difference between the bills, currently, is in how they are financed. The Senate, meanwhile, relies largely on an \"excise tax\" for high cost 'Cadillac' insurance plans, as well as an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for high earners. The House and Senate bills would mandate the purchase of policies that pay 100% of the cost of certain services, with no co-pay; when the Senate bill was amended to mandate paying for tests that a federal panel and U.S. News & World Report said \"do more harm than good,\" The New York Times wrote, \"This sorry episode does not bode well for reform efforts to rein in spending on other procedures based on sound scientific evidence of their potential benefits and risks for patients.\" Differences in how each chamber determines subsidies\n\nHow each bill determines subsidies also differs. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. To understand how each bill can affect different poverty levels and incomes, see the Kaiser Family Foundation's subsidy calculator\n\nSubsidies Under House Bill\n\nThe House plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses. Subsidies Under Senate Bill\n\nThe Senate plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses. The Senate Bill also seeks to reduce out-of-pocket costs by setting guidelines for how much of the health costs can be shifted to a family within 200% of the poverty line. The House and Senate bill would differ, somewhat, in their overall impact. The Senate bill would cover an additional 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, and reduce the deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. The House bill, meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade. Commentary on the cost analysis\nIt is worth noting that both bills rely on a number of \"gimmicks\" to get their favorable deficit reduction numbers. The shift in parties was even more pronounced during the first three months of 2009, when Democrats collected 60% of the $5.4 million donated by health care companies and their employees, the data show. Lawmakers that chair key committees have been leading recipients, some of whom received over $1.0 million in contributions. Key politicians on the Senate Finance Committee involved in crafting legislation have received over $2 million in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry. Mr. Baucus stated in February 2009 that: \"There may come a time when we can push for single-payer. At this time, it's not going to get to first base in Congress.\" George McGovern wrote that significant campaign funds were given to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care legislation: \"Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, and his political action committee have received nearly $4 million from the health-care lobby since 2003. The ranking Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, has received more than $2 million. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Baucus and Grassley are firm opponents of the single-payer system, as are other highly placed members of Congress who have been generously rewarded by the insurance lobby.\" Debate about political organizing methods\nMuch of the coverage of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as \"The Summer of Astroturf\" given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides. Arguments concerning health care reform\n\nLiberal arguments\nSome have argued that health care is a fundamental human right. Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated a right to medical care in his 1944 proposal for a Second Bill of Rights. Liberals were the primary advocates of both Social Security and Medicare, which are often targeted as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries. President Obama argued during a September 2009 joint session of Congress that the government has a moral responsibility to ensure quality healthcare is available to all citizens. He also referred to a letter from the late Senator Ted Kennedy. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has argued that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: \"At this point, the guiding principle of one of our nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America.\" He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is \"utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. In the 1930s, president Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation for universal health care was vehemently opposed and attacked by the American Medical Association. President Truman, who was a strong supporter of the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill which would instate a national medical insurance program financed by taxes, was elected in the late 1940s and the AMA spent over $1 million on an anti-health reform campaign, denouncing the bill and fueled even more by cold war rhetoric of socialism. As illustrated by these tensions, Cold war propaganda and socialism was so central in the debates of healthcare that ideas of health insurance and accessibility became inextricable from politics. Much of the conservative rhetoric throughout US history has centered on Cold War propaganda and neoliberal economic ideology. The republican President Reagan spoke out against Socialized Medicine, in which he “criticized Social Security for supplanting private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom\" and that \"pretty soon your son will not decide when he is in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living\". For example, Conservative GOP columnist Bill Kristol advocated several free-market reforms instead of the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period. Investigative reporter and columnist John Stossel has remarked that \"Insurance invites waste. Republican Senator and medical doctor Tom Coburn has stated that the healthcare system in Switzerland should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for New York Sun that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage. Some critics of the bills passed in 2009 call them a \"government take over of health care.\" FactCheck called the phrase an unjustified \"mantra.\" President Obama disputes the notion of a government takeover and says he no more wants government bureaucrats meddling than he wants insurance company bureaucrats doing so. Other sources contend the bills do amount to either a government takeover or a corporate takeover, or both. This debate occurs in the context of a \"revolution...transforming how medical care is delivered:\" from 2002 to 2008, the percentage of medical practices owned by doctors fell from more than 70% to below 50%; in contrast to the traditional practice in which most doctors cared for patients in small, privately owned clinics, by 2008 most doctors had become employees of hospitals, nearly all of which are owned by corporations or government. Republicans also argue the proposed excise tax on medical devices and drugs would increase the tax burden on vaccine makers. Senator Judd Gregg (R) said in an interview regarding the passage of healthcare reform: \"Well, in my judgment we’re moving down a path towards... Europeanization of our nation. And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when nobody else is willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model.\" Politics\n\n Rep. Cassidy, who sponsored the bill, said that the \"legislation is about keeping a promise and doing right by the American people.\" Cassidy said that they should \"keep the promise to middle class workers and ensure that if they like their healthcare plan, they can keep it.\" Opponents, such as Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), argued that \"this bill is nothing more than another political attack on the Affordable Care Act.\" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that at least 2 million people would probably sign up for the health insurance plans that would once again be legal if this bill were to pass. Carney indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the tax and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans. President Barack Obama's administration already temporarily addressed this issue by exempting through 2017 some expatriate healthcare providers from the requirements. On the occasion of the bill's passage by the House, Delaware Governor Jack Markell issued a statement praising his state's Congressmen for their work on the bill, saying that it would keep hundreds of Cigna jobs from being moved out of their state.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

She had come to Houston in 2001 on a visitor’s visa, with her husband and 2-year-old son. She became acutely ill during this visit and was initiated on dialysis. For now, SL waits patiently in the ED alongside 10–15 other similar patients, all of whom are hoping for one thing: a single dialysis treatment that day. Of the 12 million undocumented individuals living in the United States, an estimated 6500 individuals have kidney failure requiring chronic dialysis (1). Although for many patients dialysis is a bridge to transplantation, sadly, undocumented individuals are often excluded from transplantation despite the fact that several of them are excellent transplant candidates due to their better overall health, younger age, and available potential donors (3). Public policies to provide health care for noncitizens began with the Migrant Health Act, signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Currently, >1000 such centers provide comprehensive primary care to >20 million uninsured or undocumented individuals annually (4). Timeline of pertinent legislation and events related to dialysis-dependent undocumented immigrants. This singular act covering dialysis and kidney transplantation has led to longer and more productive lives for millions of Americans. Undocumented individuals, even those who may have contributed to social security, are excluded from this coverage. This amendment, passed in 1986 and referred to as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, requires that a patient who comes to an ED with an emergent medical condition be provided with treatment (such as dialysis) until stable or transferred to another hospital. It is under this provision that undocumented individuals have qualified for emergent dialysis (6). A major and disconcerting ethical quandary is the practice of emergent dialysis, which forces care providers into making difficult and unjustifiable ethical decisions, such as “who deserves treatment that day.” Nephrologists caring for this population advocate for their patients often by bending the rules or “working” the system (7). In some states, notably California, undocumented patients receive regularly scheduled dialysis treatments that are covered by state and matched by federal resources (Medicaid). California chooses to provide dialysis to the undocumented as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, also referred to as the Welfare Reform Act (Figure 1), the federal law that allows individual states to decide what outpatient services to provide noncitizens. In 2002 in Arizona, a trio of undocumented dialysis-dependent individuals filed suit to overturn a state policy that disallowed outpatient dialysis for undocumented individuals (Figure 1). A preliminary injunction was granted, and in 2007 Arizona restored its policy of providing regularly scheduled outpatient dialysis to undocumented individuals with kidney failure (8). The cost of patients receiving emergent dialysis in Houston is nearly four times more than those receiving scheduled dialysis: $285,000 versus $77,000 per year (9). Undocumented patients admitted to two safety-net hospitals in New York City to initiate dialysis incurred a 29% higher cost when compared with United States citizens admitted for the same reason (10). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services classifies such cases as superutilizers, defined as “a patient who accumulates large number of ED visits and hospital admissions which might have been prevented by relatively inexpensive early interventions and primary care.” From 2011 to 2012, 3% of superutilizers at the primary safety-net hospital in Denver, Colorado, accounted for 30% of total charges. In the absence of a federal policy to revise or reform the 1996 Welfare Reform Act or ratify comprehensive immigration reform, nearly all dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals will remain excluded from the standard avenues of care. Undocumented individuals are ineligible for all federal insurance programs because they are not legal residents or citizens of the United States. Approximately 29% of undocumented individuals acquire private health insurance through their employer. Of the four states with the most undocumented residents (California, Texas, Florida, and New York), Texas has the highest rate of uninsured undocumented individuals at 75%. Although there have never been federal regulations prohibiting the sale of private insurance to undocumented individuals, insurers previously denied those with certain chronic illnesses from purchasing a commercial insurance plan. It is this provision that made it possible for dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals to purchase insurance plans off the marketplace exchange. In general, this is prohibitively expensive for undocumented individuals, 40% of whom have annual incomes that are 138% below the Federal Poverty Level of <$16,000 for an individual or <$34,000 for a family of four. Nearly 81% of the undocumented individuals without health insurance are within this income range (12). Nearly all of the dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals with new off-exchange insurance plans qualify for charitable support from the AKF due to low income levels. If major insurance carriers deny patient assistance from third party payers, such as the AKF, this will have far-reaching consequences for thousands of patients on dialysis. This occurrence of undocumented dialysis-dependent individuals purchasing off-exchange insurance was first described in Illinois in 2014; and in conversations with nephrologists around the country, it occurs elsewhere but is neither widely publicized nor utilized (17). Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas and Harris Health in Houston represent the two largest safety-net hospital systems in Texas, and two of the five largest in the United States (18). Both cities have a large undocumented immigrant population and an already overburdened hospital system. In the Harris Health safety-net system, undocumented individuals account for 14% of total operating and up to 25% of uncompensated care costs (19). Since 2002, the average monthly census of emergent dialysis patients in Houston has been about 90 patients, who account for about 16 dialysis treatments and up to 15% of hospital admissions each day. During the 2015 open enrollment period (November of 2014 to February of 2015), >100 undocumented individuals dependent on emergent dialysis in Dallas purchased insurance off-exchange. In January of 2016, after learning of this policy, >30 undocumented emergent dialysis-dependent individuals in Houston, including SL, were enrolled in the same plan. Because open enrollment typically occurs between November and February, all remaining emergent dialysis patients as well as new undocumented patients that commence dialysis in 2016 will only receive emergent treatments until the 2017 open enrollment period. The significant reduction in blood transfusions, ED visits, and days admitted represent major cost savings to the county hospital system. In his own words, “Tengo mucha más energía. The purchase of off-exchange plans by undocumented individuals to cover dialysis services is a novel and creative solution to the national problem but is susceptible to market changes. Undocumented individuals in Texas have been able to purchase insurance because enrollment in these specific plans did not require any of the following documentation: a valid work visa, passport, or social security number. For example, in 2015, the off-exchange policy purchased by the undocumented patients in Dallas was a Preferred Provider Organization plan. Vigilance and creativity by dialysis facility administrators and social workers are essential for the continued coverage of these new plans. Two examples from personal experience that threaten sustainability of this option for the undocumented population are: (1) the policies of nine of the 32 Houston patients did not begin to pay for dialysis treatments until 3 months after the enrollment date, hence, the dialysis center absorbed the cost during this time; and (2) if the premiums were not received by the insurance company due to third party processing delays or the patient retaining the money and not sending payment, the policy was terminated. For now, this has been a life-changing experience for these patients who describe feeling like they are “en un sueno” (in a dream) from which they are afraid to wake up. Finally, there is concern over undocumented patients’ continued purchase of commercial plans to receive scheduled dialysis, particularly if dialysis centers and hospital systems currently providing charity or Medicaid-funded treatments decide to coerce their undocumented patients to obtain private coverage. One solution that has been proposed to this eventuality in California is the creation of a separate exchange specifically for undocumented individuals (22). The answer to these concerns is the reason for an urgent, sustainable solution to this national problem. The United States is a nation of immigrants. Undocumented individuals are members of the community in which they live and there is a moral and fiscal obligation to provide them with adequate health care. As our nation scrutinizes its health care system and wrestles with immigration reform, the care of undocumented individuals with chronic diseases epitomizes the crux of the proposed national agendas. The burden has traditionally been shouldered by hospital systems in large cities, particularly those in close proximity to our southern border. Without a path to citizenship and by exclusion from the ACA marketplace exchanges, undocumented individuals have limited options. Herein, the novel ability to purchase private insurance off the marketplace exchange shifts costs away from overburdened hospital systems and provides a more humane way to treat dialysis-dependent undocumented individuals. The Texas experience has alleviated serious ethical dilemmas; it has been positive and rewarding to both patients and nephrologists. SL now receives scheduled hemodialysis, three times a week at a for-profit outpatient dialysis center that is conveniently located near her home. did not receive any financial support.

The healthcare reform debate in the United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. In the next administration, President Trump said the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform:\n\n repeal Obamacare\n reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance\n institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals\n make Health Saving Accounts inheritable\n require price transparency\n block-grant Medicaid to the states\n allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers\n\nHe also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from a household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. The United States has the lowest life expectancy overall and the infant mortality rate is the highest and in some cases twice as high when compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Cost and efficiency\n\nThe United States spends a higher proportion of its GDP on healthcare (19%) than any other country in the world, except for East Timor (Timor-Leste). Proponents of healthcare reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal healthcare argue that the need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends to drive up costs, leading to more expensive provision. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on healthcare with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, “that kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.”\n\nAllegations of waste\n\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of healthcare spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud. Ideas for reform\n\nDuring a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama outlined his strategy for reform. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" Insurance reforms\nThe debate has involved certain insurance industry practices such as the placing of caps on coverage, the high level of co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called \"Cadillac policies\") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. Democratic legislators have largely supported the proposed reform efforts, while Republicans have criticized the government option or expanded regulation of healthcare. Tax reform\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has also described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:\n\nIn November 2009, The Economist estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts. Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical pre-existing conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions. Palin's death panel remarks were based on the ideas of Betsy McCaughey. During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against alleged rationing, referring to what by her interpretation was a \"downright evil\" \"death panel\" in current reform legislation known as H.R. However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and advance directives for patients in 2008. Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation H.R. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who sponsored the H.R. Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who co-sponsored a 2007 end-of-life counseling provision, called the euthanasia claim \"nuts\". According to TIME and ABC, Palin and Betsy McCaughey made false euthanasia claims. The federal requirement that hospitals help patients with things like living wills began when Republican George H. W. Bush was President. Slate columnist Christopher Beam used the term \"deathers\" to refer to those who believed rationing and euthanasia would become likely for senior citizens. The Rachel Maddow Show aired a program called \"Obama and the Deathers\" in which Maddow discussed conspiracy theories that included \"a secret plot to kill old people.\" Daily Kos and other web sites had used the term for about a week before Hari Sevugan, national spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, sent out an email with the subject line \"Murkowski: Deathers 'Lying' 'Inciting Fear.'\" The message included an article about a town hall statement by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, that no version of healthcare reform included \"death panels\". Sevugan explained the term \"deathers\" to Patricia Murphy, who used to write a Politics Daily column called \"The Capitolist\":\n\nBy \"deather,\" I mean an opponent of change who is knowingly spreading false information regarding the existence of an alleged \"death panel\" in health insurance reform plans despite the fact the claim has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by independent fact-checking organizations. Like \"birthers\", \"deathers\" are shamefully lying and trafficking in scurrilous rumors to incite fear and achieve their stated political objective of derailing the president of the United States. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform is not part of the bills under consideration: \"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. Addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses and hospital capacity\nThe U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Only four OECD countries have fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than the U.S, which has 2.7 per 1,000 population versus an OECD average of 3.8. Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: \"Clearly more auditing needs to be done and it needs to be done in real time.\" Canada's system is largely publicly funded. Advocates argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Opponents argue that switching to a single-payer system would create more problems and setbacks. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will. Privatize Medicare with a voucher system\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. Congressional Proposals for Health Care Reform\n\nOn November 7, 2009, the House passed their version of a health insurance reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, 220–215, but this did not become law. Republicans continue to claim that they had a workable bill to extend coverage to all Americans and not cost the taxpayer anything, though nothing has been publicly presented to back the claim. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills. Similarities between the House and Senate Bills\nThe two bills are similar in a number of ways. In particular, both bills:\n Mandate minimum health insurance benefits for most Americans\n Remove insurer set annual and lifetime caps on coverage and limit co-pay amounts\n Remove co-pays on certain services such as health screenings and some vaccinations\n Impose a new excise tax on medical devices and drugs, including vaccines (the federal government began taxing vaccines in 1987). Establish health insurance exchanges making easier price and coverage comparisons and purchasing for people and small businesses buying health care coverage\n Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards\n Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions\n Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums\n Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums\n Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on\n Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage\n Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)\n Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance\n Impose a penalty on employers who do not offer health insurance to their workers\n Impose a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance (except American Indians (currently covered by the Indian Health Service), people with religious objections and people who can show financial hardship)\n Provide health insurance assistance subsidies for those earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level that must buy insurance for themselves\n Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program\n Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called Medicare Advantage plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments , reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices , cutting other Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance. Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs. Differences in the House and Senate Bills\nThe biggest difference between the bills, currently, is in how they are financed. The Senate, meanwhile, relies largely on an \"excise tax\" for high cost 'Cadillac' insurance plans, as well as an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for high earners. The House and Senate bills would mandate the purchase of policies that pay 100% of the cost of certain services, with no co-pay; when the Senate bill was amended to mandate paying for tests that a federal panel and U.S. News & World Report said \"do more harm than good,\" The New York Times wrote, \"This sorry episode does not bode well for reform efforts to rein in spending on other procedures based on sound scientific evidence of their potential benefits and risks for patients.\" Differences in how each chamber determines subsidies\n\nHow each bill determines subsidies also differs. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. To understand how each bill can affect different poverty levels and incomes, see the Kaiser Family Foundation's subsidy calculator\n\nSubsidies Under House Bill\n\nThe House plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses. Subsidies Under Senate Bill\n\nThe Senate plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses. The Senate Bill also seeks to reduce out-of-pocket costs by setting guidelines for how much of the health costs can be shifted to a family within 200% of the poverty line. The House and Senate bill would differ, somewhat, in their overall impact. The Senate bill would cover an additional 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, and reduce the deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. The House bill, meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade. Commentary on the cost analysis\nIt is worth noting that both bills rely on a number of \"gimmicks\" to get their favorable deficit reduction numbers. The shift in parties was even more pronounced during the first three months of 2009, when Democrats collected 60% of the $5.4 million donated by health care companies and their employees, the data show. Lawmakers that chair key committees have been leading recipients, some of whom received over $1.0 million in contributions. Key politicians on the Senate Finance Committee involved in crafting legislation have received over $2 million in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry. Mr. Baucus stated in February 2009 that: \"There may come a time when we can push for single-payer. At this time, it's not going to get to first base in Congress.\" George McGovern wrote that significant campaign funds were given to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care legislation: \"Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, and his political action committee have received nearly $4 million from the health-care lobby since 2003. The ranking Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, has received more than $2 million. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Baucus and Grassley are firm opponents of the single-payer system, as are other highly placed members of Congress who have been generously rewarded by the insurance lobby.\" Debate about political organizing methods\nMuch of the coverage of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as \"The Summer of Astroturf\" given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides. Arguments concerning health care reform\n\nLiberal arguments\nSome have argued that health care is a fundamental human right. Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated a right to medical care in his 1944 proposal for a Second Bill of Rights. Liberals were the primary advocates of both Social Security and Medicare, which are often targeted as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries. President Obama argued during a September 2009 joint session of Congress that the government has a moral responsibility to ensure quality healthcare is available to all citizens. He also referred to a letter from the late Senator Ted Kennedy. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has argued that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: \"At this point, the guiding principle of one of our nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America.\" He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is \"utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. In the 1930s, president Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation for universal health care was vehemently opposed and attacked by the American Medical Association. President Truman, who was a strong supporter of the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill which would instate a national medical insurance program financed by taxes, was elected in the late 1940s and the AMA spent over $1 million on an anti-health reform campaign, denouncing the bill and fueled even more by cold war rhetoric of socialism. As illustrated by these tensions, Cold war propaganda and socialism was so central in the debates of healthcare that ideas of health insurance and accessibility became inextricable from politics. Much of the conservative rhetoric throughout US history has centered on Cold War propaganda and neoliberal economic ideology. The republican President Reagan spoke out against Socialized Medicine, in which he “criticized Social Security for supplanting private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom\" and that \"pretty soon your son will not decide when he is in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living\". For example, Conservative GOP columnist Bill Kristol advocated several free-market reforms instead of the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period. Investigative reporter and columnist John Stossel has remarked that \"Insurance invites waste. Republican Senator and medical doctor Tom Coburn has stated that the healthcare system in Switzerland should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for New York Sun that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage. Some critics of the bills passed in 2009 call them a \"government take over of health care.\" FactCheck called the phrase an unjustified \"mantra.\" President Obama disputes the notion of a government takeover and says he no more wants government bureaucrats meddling than he wants insurance company bureaucrats doing so. Other sources contend the bills do amount to either a government takeover or a corporate takeover, or both. This debate occurs in the context of a \"revolution...transforming how medical care is delivered:\" from 2002 to 2008, the percentage of medical practices owned by doctors fell from more than 70% to below 50%; in contrast to the traditional practice in which most doctors cared for patients in small, privately owned clinics, by 2008 most doctors had become employees of hospitals, nearly all of which are owned by corporations or government. Republicans also argue the proposed excise tax on medical devices and drugs would increase the tax burden on vaccine makers. Senator Judd Gregg (R) said in an interview regarding the passage of healthcare reform: \"Well, in my judgment we’re moving down a path towards... Europeanization of our nation. And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when nobody else is willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model.\" Politics\n\n Rep. Cassidy, who sponsored the bill, said that the \"legislation is about keeping a promise and doing right by the American people.\" Cassidy said that they should \"keep the promise to middle class workers and ensure that if they like their healthcare plan, they can keep it.\" Opponents, such as Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), argued that \"this bill is nothing more than another political attack on the Affordable Care Act.\" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that at least 2 million people would probably sign up for the health insurance plans that would once again be legal if this bill were to pass. Carney indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the tax and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans. President Barack Obama's administration already temporarily addressed this issue by exempting through 2017 some expatriate healthcare providers from the requirements. On the occasion of the bill's passage by the House, Delaware Governor Jack Markell issued a statement praising his state's Congressmen for their work on the bill, saying that it would keep hundreds of Cigna jobs from being moved out of their state.\n\n"

In September 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with state and local health departments and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), began investigating a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who had received contaminated steroid injections from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts. The NECC was classified as a compounding pharmacy. The traditional role of compounding pharmacies is to make drugs prescribed by doctors for specific patients with needs that can't be met by commercially available drugs. Outbreak \n\nIn September 2012, an outbreak of fungal meningitis was reported in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  traced the outbreak to fungal contamination in three lots of a medication called methylprednisolone  used for epidural steroid injections. Infections other than meningitis were also associated with this outbreak, which spanned 19 states. As of March 10, 2013,  48 people had died and 720 were being treated for persistent fungal infections. In November 2012, some patients recovering from meningitis were reported to be experiencing secondary infections at the injection site. Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. Chin was responsible for supervising the clean rooms at the NECC and was involved in compounding the contaminated methylprednisolone. Chin was the first to be charged in the ongoing inquiry. Most seriously, Cadden and Chin were charged with helping orchestrate a massive racketeering conspiracy that led directly to 25 of the deaths. Source of infectious agents\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traced the outbreak to contaminated methylprednisolone (MPA) used for epidural steroid injections. The fungus was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of several patients, which confirmed  fungus caused the meningitis. The medication was packaged and marketed by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) of Framingham, Massachusetts. According to the CDC, between May 21 and September 24, 2012, patients in 23 U.S. states received injections from three implicated lots of a steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, for back pain, and some of these patients developed symptoms consistent with fungal meningitis. This form of meningitis can be caused by epidurally administered medications, but is not contagious by person-to-person contact. On October 9, authorities estimated as many as 14,000 patients may have been exposed to the contaminated drug. The NECC said that immediately after it was notified about the infections it initiated a voluntary recall September 26. One was a steroid called triamcinolone acetonide and another was a product used during heart surgery. If injected, the second steroid may cause fungal meningitis, while the heart drug may cause a different fungal infection. Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. However, in patients with suppressed immune systems, or if introduced directly into the spinal column, the fungus can be deadly. Despite the availability of antifungal agents, aspergillosis in the central nervous system carries a poor prognosis. Though this case sparked the nationwide investigation, as of November 4, the CDC said A. fumigatus had been identified in only one patient. At presentation, 57 (81%) had headache, 24 (34%) had fever, 21 (30%) had nausea, and seven (10%) had photophobia (intolerance to bright light). People who received injections were most vulnerable to stroke and infection within the first 42 days of injection, but three months may be needed for symptoms to appear. Fungal infections associated with nonepidural injections were also reported. People injected in peripheral joints were at risk for joint infections but were not believed to be at risk for meningitis. On November 4, some people who were treated for meningitis and released returned to the hospital with abscesses, a localized infection of the tissues at the injection site, that could lead to meningitis. The deputy chief of the mycotic diseases branch of the CDC said, \"We don't have a good handle on how many people are coming back. We are just learning about this and trying to assess how best to manage these patients. As of December 7, spinal abscesses had been reported in 23 patients who received injections in Tennessee, and 37 patients in Michigan. The CDC reported that doctors were also reporting that some people that had been injected with the contaminated drugs had arachnoiditis, a nerve inflammation that can cause intense pain, bladder problems, and numbness. In 2017, five years after the outbreak, NPR reported that \"hundreds of people around the country are still suffering from complications linked to injections of tainted medicine.\" Treatment \nFew clinicians were accustomed to dealing with fungal meningitis due to its rarity. The CDC convened an expert advisory panel to develop recommended treatment guidelines. Many affected patients were elderly and had other existing health problems further making the choice of treatment difficult. The CDC recommended that health care providers monitor patients who received contaminated injections, but advised against prophylactic treatment with antifungal drugs for patients who did not show signs of infection. They indicated that the greatest risk of developing an infection was within the first six weeks after injection. People diagnosed with meningitis could expect to take  antifungal drugs for a minimum of three months, and possibly as long as a year. Cases \nTennessee was the first state to have a reported case on September 21, 2012. As of March 10, 2013,  48 people had died and 720 were being treated for persistent fungal infections. These cases were associated with three lots of methylprednisolone acetate, portions of which were shipped by NECC to 73 health care facilities in 23 states. The final figures, which were disclosed in May 2015 when the litigation came to a close, were over 800 sickened with 64 deaths. A later report said that 798 had been affected and \"over 100\" had died. These problems cannot be laid entirely at the feet of compounders when clinicians persist in clinical practices despite weak evidence of efficacy.\" Doctors in professional societies are not in agreement about treatment guidelines. A four-year study released in 2013 suggested epidural steroid injections  may actually lead to worse outcomes whether or not the patient later underwent surgery, and no evidence showed receiving steroid injections helped patients to avoid surgery. Such pharmacies are authorized to combine, mix, or alter ingredients to create specific formulations of drugs to meet the specific needs of individual patients, and only in response to individual prescriptions. In 2003, an official from the Food and Drug Administration told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that in 2001 the agency had done a \"limited\" survey of drugs from 12 compounding pharmacies, including hormones, antibiotics, steroids, and drugs to treat glaucoma, asthma, and erectile dysfunction, and 10 of the 29 drugs failed one or more quality tests. Responding to the NECC meningitis outbreak, health officials and lawmakers said that compounding pharmacies can \"fall into a regulatory black hole.\" The NEJM noted:\n First, traditional compounding was limited to a pharmacist or a physician serving a specific patient. receiving valid prescription orders.\" According to the preliminary report from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, NECC far exceeded these limits in preparing and shipping vials of methylprednisolone acetate. Once disconnected from individual patients, compounding increasingly resembles drug manufacturing. Section 503A prohibited compounding \"regularly or in inordinate amounts\" any drugs that were \"essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.\" FDA-approved methylprednisolone acetate is sold by Pfizer and two generics companies, but since NECC's version did not contain preservatives, it could sidestep this regulatory process — with tragic results. Some patients lost the remaining vision in the eye being treated. On November 13, manufacturing problems were reported to be found at Ameridose, a Massachusetts company that makes injectable drugs. According to an FDA spokesperson, an inspection revealed the firm \"fails to test finished product for potency, failed to investigate complaints for ineffective products, failed to investigate violations of their own environmental sampling plan and fails to adequately maintain equipment and facilities used to manufacture sterile drug products\". According to the report, when doctors contacted the firm to say problems with its drugs had been found, the complaints were not classified as adverse events. That included \"incidents when women given Ameridose's oxytocin, a drug used to bring on labor, reported fetal distress, severe post birth bleeding and shortness of breath. A blood thinner, heparin, had a complaint that the patient had a life-threatening adverse event [and when] the firm's pain medication fentanyl, given to cancer patients and as an anesthetic, was used, two patients were reported to have gone into respiratory distress.\" At Ameridose, a pharmacist complained to management that quality control workers, who were not trained pharmacists, did work they should not have done. She said  \"near misses\" of wrong doses were caught before they were shipped. A quality control technician tried to stop an assembly line and was eventually fired. The Whittier Pharmacist, in Haverhill, was ordered to cease sterile compounding after unspecified violations were found, and OncoMed Pharmaceutical Services was ordered to close its Waltham facility after problems with the storage of chemotherapy drugs were found. Med Prep Consulting Inc and Clinical Specialties Compounding Pharmacy both issued recalls after Med Prep found particles floating in five doses of a compounded solution, and Clinical Specialties heard about five eye infections in patients who had received compounded eye injections. Some doctors and clinics may have turned away from major drug manufacturers and turned to compounding pharmacies as manufacturers because they often charge much lower prices than the major manufacturers. Records suggested  NECC had failed to sterilize products for \"even the minimum amount of time necessary to ensure sterility.\" Mats used to trap dust and dirt outside the rooms were dirty, sterile hoods were not properly cleaned, and a boiler was leaking next to a clean room, according to officials. Investigations also found that medical staff were using fake names such as \"Harry Potter,” “Baby Jesus,\" and “Chester Cheeto” to create fraudulent prescriptions for drugs. NECC had started to receive complaints in 1999, less than a year after it had been established. In 2004, state health officials charged the pharmacy with failure to comply with accepted standards when mixing methylprednisolone acetate, the same steroid that was the source of the 2012 meningitis outbreak. In 2002, the FDA investigated reports that five patients had become dizzy and short of breath after receiving a steroid used to treat joint pain and arthritis different from the one linked to the current meningitis outbreak. Also in 2002, the FDA received reports that two patients at a Rochester, N.Y., hospital came down with symptoms of bacterial meningitis after receiving injections of methylprednisolone acetate, the same injectable linked to the current outbreak. Joyce Lovelace, the widow of 78-year-old Eddie C. Lovelace, who was the first confirmed victim of the outbreak, also spoke at the hearing. In 2002, five patients became ill and two more were hospitalized with meningitis-like symptoms after they were injected with the same steroid implicated in the current outbreak, and yet the state took no action until 2006. Litigation and prosecution \n\nIn October 2012, plaintiffs in federally filed fungal meningitis lawsuits petitioned the U.S. In December 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy and U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor ruled that meningitis lawsuits pending in Massachusetts federal court would be consolidated and allowed to move forward. In May 2015, federal bankruptcy judge Henry Boroff approved a $200 million settlement plan that would set aside funds for victims of the outbreak and their families. On December 17, federal prosecutors in Boston unsealed a 131-count federal criminal indictment related to the outbreak. It charged 14 former NECC employees, including president Barry Cadden and pharmacist Glenn Chin, with a host of criminal offenses. The RICO count alleged 68 overt acts—including 25 counts of second-degree murder in seven states against Cadden and Chin. If convicted, Cadden and Chin faced life in prison. In October 2017, Chin was convicted of racketeering and mail fraud but acquitted of second-degree murder as well; he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. In May 2019, two pharmacists were sentenced in connection with the compounding center. Michelle Caetano Thomas, an assistant pharmacy professor at the University of Rhode Island, and Kathy Chin were convicted on two felony counts for their role in the scheme for filling obviously phony prescriptions for patients such as Coco Puff, LL Bean, and Mary Lamb. 3204; 113th Congress) in response to the meningitis outbreak. \"Lethal medicine linked to meningitis outbreak\" CBS 60 Minutes report (March 2013) \n 2020 expose' by American Greed (S13E10) \"Painful Greed Turns Deadly\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \"Lethal medicine linked to meningitis outbreak\" CBS 60 Minutes report (March 2013) \n \"Frequently Asked Questions for Clinicians: Multistate Outbreak of Fungal Meningitis and Other Infections\"\n \n \n \"Vanderbilt team details TN meningitis death\" By Brian Haas, The Tennessean, October 22, 2012.

All five remaining defendants, including former billionaire John Kapoor, were convicted of racketeering. Judge \n\nA New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak that began in September 2012 sickened 798 individuals and resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people. In September 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with state and local health departments and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), began investigating a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who had received contaminated steroid injections from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts. The NECC was classified as a compounding pharmacy. The traditional role of compounding pharmacies is to make drugs prescribed by doctors for specific patients with needs that can't be met by commercially available drugs. Outbreak \n\nIn September 2012, an outbreak of fungal meningitis was reported in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  traced the outbreak to fungal contamination in three lots of a medication called methylprednisolone  used for epidural steroid injections. Infections other than meningitis were also associated with this outbreak, which spanned 19 states. As of March 10, 2013,  48 people had died and 720 were being treated for persistent fungal infections. In November 2012, some patients recovering from meningitis were reported to be experiencing secondary infections at the injection site. Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. Chin was responsible for supervising the clean rooms at the NECC and was involved in compounding the contaminated methylprednisolone. Chin was the first to be charged in the ongoing inquiry. Most seriously, Cadden and Chin were charged with helping orchestrate a massive racketeering conspiracy that led directly to 25 of the deaths. Source of infectious agents\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traced the outbreak to contaminated methylprednisolone (MPA) used for epidural steroid injections. The fungus was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of several patients, which confirmed  fungus caused the meningitis. The medication was packaged and marketed by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) of Framingham, Massachusetts. According to the CDC, between May 21 and September 24, 2012, patients in 23 U.S. states received injections from three implicated lots of a steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, for back pain, and some of these patients developed symptoms consistent with fungal meningitis. This form of meningitis can be caused by epidurally administered medications, but is not contagious by person-to-person contact. On October 9, authorities estimated as many as 14,000 patients may have been exposed to the contaminated drug. The NECC said that immediately after it was notified about the infections it initiated a voluntary recall September 26. One was a steroid called triamcinolone acetonide and another was a product used during heart surgery. If injected, the second steroid may cause fungal meningitis, while the heart drug may cause a different fungal infection. Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. However, in patients with suppressed immune systems, or if introduced directly into the spinal column, the fungus can be deadly. Despite the availability of antifungal agents, aspergillosis in the central nervous system carries a poor prognosis. Though this case sparked the nationwide investigation, as of November 4, the CDC said A. fumigatus had been identified in only one patient. At presentation, 57 (81%) had headache, 24 (34%) had fever, 21 (30%) had nausea, and seven (10%) had photophobia (intolerance to bright light). People who received injections were most vulnerable to stroke and infection within the first 42 days of injection, but three months may be needed for symptoms to appear. Fungal infections associated with nonepidural injections were also reported. People injected in peripheral joints were at risk for joint infections but were not believed to be at risk for meningitis. On November 4, some people who were treated for meningitis and released returned to the hospital with abscesses, a localized infection of the tissues at the injection site, that could lead to meningitis. The deputy chief of the mycotic diseases branch of the CDC said, \"We don't have a good handle on how many people are coming back. We are just learning about this and trying to assess how best to manage these patients. As of December 7, spinal abscesses had been reported in 23 patients who received injections in Tennessee, and 37 patients in Michigan. The CDC reported that doctors were also reporting that some people that had been injected with the contaminated drugs had arachnoiditis, a nerve inflammation that can cause intense pain, bladder problems, and numbness. In 2017, five years after the outbreak, NPR reported that \"hundreds of people around the country are still suffering from complications linked to injections of tainted medicine.\" Treatment \nFew clinicians were accustomed to dealing with fungal meningitis due to its rarity. The CDC convened an expert advisory panel to develop recommended treatment guidelines. Many affected patients were elderly and had other existing health problems further making the choice of treatment difficult. The CDC recommended that health care providers monitor patients who received contaminated injections, but advised against prophylactic treatment with antifungal drugs for patients who did not show signs of infection. They indicated that the greatest risk of developing an infection was within the first six weeks after injection. People diagnosed with meningitis could expect to take  antifungal drugs for a minimum of three months, and possibly as long as a year. Cases \nTennessee was the first state to have a reported case on September 21, 2012. As of March 10, 2013,  48 people had died and 720 were being treated for persistent fungal infections. These cases were associated with three lots of methylprednisolone acetate, portions of which were shipped by NECC to 73 health care facilities in 23 states. The final figures, which were disclosed in May 2015 when the litigation came to a close, were over 800 sickened with 64 deaths. A later report said that 798 had been affected and \"over 100\" had died. These problems cannot be laid entirely at the feet of compounders when clinicians persist in clinical practices despite weak evidence of efficacy.\" Doctors in professional societies are not in agreement about treatment guidelines. A four-year study released in 2013 suggested epidural steroid injections  may actually lead to worse outcomes whether or not the patient later underwent surgery, and no evidence showed receiving steroid injections helped patients to avoid surgery. Such pharmacies are authorized to combine, mix, or alter ingredients to create specific formulations of drugs to meet the specific needs of individual patients, and only in response to individual prescriptions. In 2003, an official from the Food and Drug Administration told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that in 2001 the agency had done a \"limited\" survey of drugs from 12 compounding pharmacies, including hormones, antibiotics, steroids, and drugs to treat glaucoma, asthma, and erectile dysfunction, and 10 of the 29 drugs failed one or more quality tests. Responding to the NECC meningitis outbreak, health officials and lawmakers said that compounding pharmacies can \"fall into a regulatory black hole.\" The NEJM noted:\n First, traditional compounding was limited to a pharmacist or a physician serving a specific patient. receiving valid prescription orders.\" According to the preliminary report from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, NECC far exceeded these limits in preparing and shipping vials of methylprednisolone acetate. Once disconnected from individual patients, compounding increasingly resembles drug manufacturing. Section 503A prohibited compounding \"regularly or in inordinate amounts\" any drugs that were \"essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.\" FDA-approved methylprednisolone acetate is sold by Pfizer and two generics companies, but since NECC's version did not contain preservatives, it could sidestep this regulatory process — with tragic results. Some patients lost the remaining vision in the eye being treated. On November 13, manufacturing problems were reported to be found at Ameridose, a Massachusetts company that makes injectable drugs. According to an FDA spokesperson, an inspection revealed the firm \"fails to test finished product for potency, failed to investigate complaints for ineffective products, failed to investigate violations of their own environmental sampling plan and fails to adequately maintain equipment and facilities used to manufacture sterile drug products\". According to the report, when doctors contacted the firm to say problems with its drugs had been found, the complaints were not classified as adverse events. That included \"incidents when women given Ameridose's oxytocin, a drug used to bring on labor, reported fetal distress, severe post birth bleeding and shortness of breath. A blood thinner, heparin, had a complaint that the patient had a life-threatening adverse event [and when] the firm's pain medication fentanyl, given to cancer patients and as an anesthetic, was used, two patients were reported to have gone into respiratory distress.\" At Ameridose, a pharmacist complained to management that quality control workers, who were not trained pharmacists, did work they should not have done. She said  \"near misses\" of wrong doses were caught before they were shipped. A quality control technician tried to stop an assembly line and was eventually fired. The Whittier Pharmacist, in Haverhill, was ordered to cease sterile compounding after unspecified violations were found, and OncoMed Pharmaceutical Services was ordered to close its Waltham facility after problems with the storage of chemotherapy drugs were found. Med Prep Consulting Inc and Clinical Specialties Compounding Pharmacy both issued recalls after Med Prep found particles floating in five doses of a compounded solution, and Clinical Specialties heard about five eye infections in patients who had received compounded eye injections. Some doctors and clinics may have turned away from major drug manufacturers and turned to compounding pharmacies as manufacturers because they often charge much lower prices than the major manufacturers. Records suggested  NECC had failed to sterilize products for \"even the minimum amount of time necessary to ensure sterility.\" Mats used to trap dust and dirt outside the rooms were dirty, sterile hoods were not properly cleaned, and a boiler was leaking next to a clean room, according to officials. Investigations also found that medical staff were using fake names such as \"Harry Potter,” “Baby Jesus,\" and “Chester Cheeto” to create fraudulent prescriptions for drugs. NECC had started to receive complaints in 1999, less than a year after it had been established. In 2004, state health officials charged the pharmacy with failure to comply with accepted standards when mixing methylprednisolone acetate, the same steroid that was the source of the 2012 meningitis outbreak.

Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. Chin was responsible for supervising the clean rooms at the NECC and was involved in compounding the contaminated methylprednisolone. Chin was the first to be charged in the ongoing inquiry. Most seriously, Cadden and Chin were charged with helping orchestrate a massive racketeering conspiracy that led directly to 25 of the deaths. Source of infectious agents\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traced the outbreak to contaminated methylprednisolone (MPA) used for epidural steroid injections. The fungus was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of several patients, which confirmed  fungus caused the meningitis. The medication was packaged and marketed by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) of Framingham, Massachusetts. According to the CDC, between May 21 and September 24, 2012, patients in 23 U.S. states received injections from three implicated lots of a steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, for back pain, and some of these patients developed symptoms consistent with fungal meningitis. This form of meningitis can be caused by epidurally administered medications, but is not contagious by person-to-person contact. On October 9, authorities estimated as many as 14,000 patients may have been exposed to the contaminated drug. The NECC said that immediately after it was notified about the infections it initiated a voluntary recall September 26. One was a steroid called triamcinolone acetonide and another was a product used during heart surgery. If injected, the second steroid may cause fungal meningitis, while the heart drug may cause a different fungal infection. Although no cases of infection were reported to be associated with any other lots of medication, all lots of all medications distributed by NECC were recalled in separate actions by NECC and regulators. However, in patients with suppressed immune systems, or if introduced directly into the spinal column, the fungus can be deadly. Despite the availability of antifungal agents, aspergillosis in the central nervous system carries a poor prognosis. Though this case sparked the nationwide investigation, as of November 4, the CDC said A. fumigatus had been identified in only one patient. At presentation, 57 (81%) had headache, 24 (34%) had fever, 21 (30%) had nausea, and seven (10%) had photophobia (intolerance to bright light). People who received injections were most vulnerable to stroke and infection within the first 42 days of injection, but three months may be needed for symptoms to appear. Fungal infections associated with nonepidural injections were also reported. People injected in peripheral joints were at risk for joint infections but were not believed to be at risk for meningitis. On November 4, some people who were treated for meningitis and released returned to the hospital with abscesses, a localized infection of the tissues at the injection site, that could lead to meningitis. The deputy chief of the mycotic diseases branch of the CDC said, \"We don't have a good handle on how many people are coming back. We are just learning about this and trying to assess how best to manage these patients. As of December 7, spinal abscesses had been reported in 23 patients who received injections in Tennessee, and 37 patients in Michigan. The CDC reported that doctors were also reporting that some people that had been injected with the contaminated drugs had arachnoiditis, a nerve inflammation that can cause intense pain, bladder problems, and numbness. In 2017, five years after the outbreak, NPR reported that \"hundreds of people around the country are still suffering from complications linked to injections of tainted medicine.\" Treatment \nFew clinicians were accustomed to dealing with fungal meningitis due to its rarity. The CDC convened an expert advisory panel to develop recommended treatment guidelines. Many affected patients were elderly and had other existing health problems further making the choice of treatment difficult. The CDC recommended that health care providers monitor patients who received contaminated injections, but advised against prophylactic treatment with antifungal drugs for patients who did not show signs of infection. They indicated that the greatest risk of developing an infection was within the first six weeks after injection. People diagnosed with meningitis could expect to take  antifungal drugs for a minimum of three months, and possibly as long as a year. Cases \nTennessee was the first state to have a reported case on September 21, 2012. As of March 10, 2013,  48 people had died and 720 were being treated for persistent fungal infections. These cases were associated with three lots of methylprednisolone acetate, portions of which were shipped by NECC to 73 health care facilities in 23 states. The final figures, which were disclosed in May 2015 when the litigation came to a close, were over 800 sickened with 64 deaths. A later report said that 798 had been affected and \"over 100\" had died. These problems cannot be laid entirely at the feet of compounders when clinicians persist in clinical practices despite weak evidence of efficacy.\" Doctors in professional societies are not in agreement about treatment guidelines. A four-year study released in 2013 suggested epidural steroid injections  may actually lead to worse outcomes whether or not the patient later underwent surgery, and no evidence showed receiving steroid injections helped patients to avoid surgery. Such pharmacies are authorized to combine, mix, or alter ingredients to create specific formulations of drugs to meet the specific needs of individual patients, and only in response to individual prescriptions. In 2003, an official from the Food and Drug Administration told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that in 2001 the agency had done a \"limited\" survey of drugs from 12 compounding pharmacies, including hormones, antibiotics, steroids, and drugs to treat glaucoma, asthma, and erectile dysfunction, and 10 of the 29 drugs failed one or more quality tests. Responding to the NECC meningitis outbreak, health officials and lawmakers said that compounding pharmacies can \"fall into a regulatory black hole.\" The NEJM noted:\n First, traditional compounding was limited to a pharmacist or a physician serving a specific patient. receiving valid prescription orders.\" According to the preliminary report from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, NECC far exceeded these limits in preparing and shipping vials of methylprednisolone acetate. Once disconnected from individual patients, compounding increasingly resembles drug manufacturing. Section 503A prohibited compounding \"regularly or in inordinate amounts\" any drugs that were \"essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.\" FDA-approved methylprednisolone acetate is sold by Pfizer and two generics companies, but since NECC's version did not contain preservatives, it could sidestep this regulatory process — with tragic results. Some patients lost the remaining vision in the eye being treated. On November 13, manufacturing problems were reported to be found at Ameridose, a Massachusetts company that makes injectable drugs. According to an FDA spokesperson, an inspection revealed the firm \"fails to test finished product for potency, failed to investigate complaints for ineffective products, failed to investigate violations of their own environmental sampling plan and fails to adequately maintain equipment and facilities used to manufacture sterile drug products\". According to the report, when doctors contacted the firm to say problems with its drugs had been found, the complaints were not classified as adverse events. That included \"incidents when women given Ameridose's oxytocin, a drug used to bring on labor, reported fetal distress, severe post birth bleeding and shortness of breath. A blood thinner, heparin, had a complaint that the patient had a life-threatening adverse event [and when] the firm's pain medication fentanyl, given to cancer patients and as an anesthetic, was used, two patients were reported to have gone into respiratory distress.\" At Ameridose, a pharmacist complained to management that quality control workers, who were not trained pharmacists, did work they should not have done. She said  \"near misses\" of wrong doses were caught before they were shipped. A quality control technician tried to stop an assembly line and was eventually fired. The Whittier Pharmacist, in Haverhill, was ordered to cease sterile compounding after unspecified violations were found, and OncoMed Pharmaceutical Services was ordered to close its Waltham facility after problems with the storage of chemotherapy drugs were found. Med Prep Consulting Inc and Clinical Specialties Compounding Pharmacy both issued recalls after Med Prep found particles floating in five doses of a compounded solution, and Clinical Specialties heard about five eye infections in patients who had received compounded eye injections. Some doctors and clinics may have turned away from major drug manufacturers and turned to compounding pharmacies as manufacturers because they often charge much lower prices than the major manufacturers. Records suggested  NECC had failed to sterilize products for \"even the minimum amount of time necessary to ensure sterility.\" Mats used to trap dust and dirt outside the rooms were dirty, sterile hoods were not properly cleaned, and a boiler was leaking next to a clean room, according to officials. Investigations also found that medical staff were using fake names such as \"Harry Potter,” “Baby Jesus,\" and “Chester Cheeto” to create fraudulent prescriptions for drugs. NECC had started to receive complaints in 1999, less than a year after it had been established. In 2004, state health officials charged the pharmacy with failure to comply with accepted standards when mixing methylprednisolone acetate, the same steroid that was the source of the 2012 meningitis outbreak. In 2002, the FDA investigated reports that five patients had become dizzy and short of breath after receiving a steroid used to treat joint pain and arthritis different from the one linked to the current meningitis outbreak. Also in 2002, the FDA received reports that two patients at a Rochester, N.Y., hospital came down with symptoms of bacterial meningitis after receiving injections of methylprednisolone acetate, the same injectable linked to the current outbreak. Joyce Lovelace, the widow of 78-year-old Eddie C. Lovelace, who was the first confirmed victim of the outbreak, also spoke at the hearing. In 2002, five patients became ill and two more were hospitalized with meningitis-like symptoms after they were injected with the same steroid implicated in the current outbreak, and yet the state took no action until 2006. Litigation and prosecution \n\nIn October 2012, plaintiffs in federally filed fungal meningitis lawsuits petitioned the U.S. In December 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy and U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor ruled that meningitis lawsuits pending in Massachusetts federal court would be consolidated and allowed to move forward. In May 2015, federal bankruptcy judge Henry Boroff approved a $200 million settlement plan that would set aside funds for victims of the outbreak and their families. On December 17, federal prosecutors in Boston unsealed a 131-count federal criminal indictment related to the outbreak. It charged 14 former NECC employees, including president Barry Cadden and pharmacist Glenn Chin, with a host of criminal offenses. The RICO count alleged 68 overt acts—including 25 counts of second-degree murder in seven states against Cadden and Chin. If convicted, Cadden and Chin faced life in prison. In October 2017, Chin was convicted of racketeering and mail fraud but acquitted of second-degree murder as well; he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. In May 2019, two pharmacists were sentenced in connection with the compounding center. Michelle Caetano Thomas, an assistant pharmacy professor at the University of Rhode Island, and Kathy Chin were convicted on two felony counts for their role in the scheme for filling obviously phony prescriptions for patients such as Coco Puff, LL Bean, and Mary Lamb. 3204; 113th Congress) in response to the meningitis outbreak. \"Lethal medicine linked to meningitis outbreak\" CBS 60 Minutes report (March 2013) \n 2020 expose' by American Greed (S13E10) \"Painful Greed Turns Deadly\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \"Lethal medicine linked to meningitis outbreak\" CBS 60 Minutes report (March 2013) \n \"Frequently Asked Questions for Clinicians: Multistate Outbreak of Fungal Meningitis and Other Infections\"\n \n \n \"Vanderbilt team details TN meningitis death\" By Brian Haas, The Tennessean, October 22, 2012.

Coming off last year's deadly flu season, medical experts are urging people to get vaccinated now. Seasonal influenza, also known as flu, causes fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion and body aches. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter, the deadliest season in more than four decades. Among the deaths were 180 children, the majority of them unvaccinated, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome M. Adams said during a news conference last month. A flu vaccination can save lives, Bitonte said. Doctors' offices and area pharmacies have vaccinations on hand and are ready to administer them. Sporadic cases can take place all year, the Ohio Department of Health reports. When should you be vaccinated? Everyone but especially the very young and very old and those at a higher risk from a chronic medical condition, including those with compromised lungs that suffer from COPD, asthma, cancer and autoimmune diseases. There are some who should not get a flu shot, including those who could have a severe reaction to the vaccination or those with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. In a best case scenario, a person who got a flu shot might come down with the flu and it might mean a few days home from work or school. Worse case scenario, a person gets the flu and is hospitalized, may need a ventilator and could risk death, Bitonte said. Why do I have to get a flu shot every year? Bitonte said the flu bugs are smart and mutate and change, therefore last year's vaccination is not effective against this year's virus. There is no live virus in the flu shot, she said. Bitonte said taking care of yourself and practicing basic hygiene will go a long way. \"Staying healthy is one of the best ways to avoid the flu,\" she said. The doctor urges anyone who is sick to stay home to not infect others. Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms should seek treatment, and most importantly, do not visit the elderly and very young. The flu virus is spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people cough, sneeze or talk. Her death is a important reminder that flu can cause serious illness or death, particularly among persons at risk for flu-related complications. During the 2017-2018 flu season, New Mexico had more than 280 influenza (flu) and pneumonia-related deaths. It is an important additional form of protection because flu frequently causes types of pneumonia that can be prevented by the pneumococcal vaccine. People of any age with certain chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung or heart disease and those who are immuno-suppressed. People who might have flu – particularly if they are in the groups listed above at risk for severe disease and complications – should seek medical care and start antiviral medication as soon as possible. In 2009, the WHO reported that H1N1/09 seemed to be more contagious than seasonal flu. However, a New England Journal of Medicine report said the transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households was lower than that seen in past pandemics. 2009 H1N1 is a type of influenza (flu) virus that causes respiratory disease that can spread between people. Most people infected with this virus in the United States have had mild disease. Young children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes or heart disease may be at higher risk for complications from this infection. What’s the difference between 2009 H1N1 flu and seasonal flu? Both are influenza A strains that can cause illness. What are the signs and symptoms of 2009 H1N1 flu? The symptoms of the 2009 H1N1 flu are the same as seasonal flu and include cough, fever, chills, body aches, headache, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose and fatigue. Severe illness (e.g., pneumonia and respiratory failure) and deaths sometimes result from infection with an influenza virus and have been reported with this specific strain. Like seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 flu may worsen underlying chronic medical conditions. The 2009 H1N1 virus spreads like the seasonal flu. How long can an infected person spread 2009 H1N1 flu to others? People with 2009 H1N1 infection are potentially contagious as long as they have symptoms. Is there a vaccine for 2009 H1N1? Monitor other family members daily for flu symptoms and keep them at home if they become ill.\nAdditional tips are available at www.CDC.gov. A majority of people with 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu recover without medication or medical treatment. Monitor your other family members daily for flu symptoms and keep them at home if they become ill.\nHow do I know if I have 2009 H1N1 flu? 2009 H1N1 is confirmed by laboratory testing done by your health care provider. Like seasonal flu, people with underlying medical conditions are more likely to have serious flu complications. Most people who have been infected with 2009 H1N1 flu have experienced mild illness and recover in a few days without seeking medical care. Is there medication to treat the flu? Antiviral medication is only recommended for people who are severely ill or at risk of serious complications from 2009 H1N1 flu. Most people infected with this, or any other flu strain, recover on their own without medical treatment. What if there are cases of 2009 H1N1 flu at my child’s school? As with any flu season, it is anticipated that school children will get 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu. Some viruses and bacteria can live 2 hours or longer on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs and desks. Your co-workers and friends will start having cough, runny nose, congestion and fevers. You may be wondering, what is the difference between an upper respiratory infection also known as the common cold and influenza? Both influenza and colds are caused by viral infections. The common cold can be caused by more than 200 viruses, and can be spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. The treatment for a cold is symptom relief since antibiotics do no kill viruses. Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases and is a highly contagious airborne disease that occurs in seasonal epidemics. The symptoms of the flu are initially very similar to those of the common cold, with fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue and myalgia, but these symptoms usually progress as the infection evolves and are more severe than those seen with the common cold. The influenza virus causes serious health issues and the CDC estimates that it is responsible for an average of more than 20,000 deaths annually. Medications are not available to the kill the influenza virus, but we have antiviral medications that can shorten the duration of illness by 1-2 days if the illness is diagnosed within the first 48 hours of onset. As you can see there are many similarities between colds and the flu, especially that they are both transmitted person to person via the air and close personal contact. While these similarities exist, it is important to note that the flu is a much more serious illness that can lead to death, especially in the pediatric and geriatric populations, and those with impaired immune systems. Take the time to get a flu vaccine, the CDC states this is the most important step in protecting against flu virus.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The symptoms of the flu are initially very similar to those of the common cold, with fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue and myalgia, but these symptoms usually progress as the infection evolves and are more severe than those seen with the common cold. The influenza virus causes serious health issues and the CDC estimates that it is responsible for an average of more than 20,000 deaths annually. Medications are not available to the kill the influenza virus, but we have antiviral medications that can shorten the duration of illness by 1-2 days if the illness is diagnosed within the first 48 hours of onset. As you can see there are many similarities between colds and the flu, especially that they are both transmitted person to person via the air and close personal contact. While these similarities exist, it is important to note that the flu is a much more serious illness that can lead to death, especially in the pediatric and geriatric populations, and those with impaired immune systems. Take the time to get a flu vaccine, the CDC states this is the most important step in protecting against flu virus.\n\n"

Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria\nTypes of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods,  (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. This mainly involves  Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis\n\nEarly diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease.

How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis? Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Different types of bacterial infection can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious condition that is often associated with sepsis and widespread organ failure. Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs. Occasionally, mycotic (fungal) species cause necrotizing fasciitis. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a \"flesh eating\" or \"skin eating\" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or \"flesh-eating parasites\" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating bacterial infection or flesh-eating disease; suppurative fasciitis; dermal, Meleney, hospital, or Fournier's gangrene; and necrotizing cellulitis. Body regions frequently have the term necrotizing placed before them to describe the initial localization of necrotizing fasciitis (for example, necrotizing colitis, necrotizing arteriolitis), but they all refer to the same disease process in the tissue. Fortunately, this disease is relatively rare; various statistical sources estimate about 500 to 1,500 individuals are reported to have the disease per year in the U.S.\nStatistics show mortality (death) rates have been reported as high as 75% for necrotizing fasciitis associated with Fournier's (scrotal) gangrene, but the mortality in patients with the infection in other regions of the body (for example, legs or arms) is about 25%. Variations of necrotizing fasciitis are placed by some investigators into three general groups or types, roughly based on the type of organisms causing the infection and some clinical findings that vary from patient to patient. Type 1 is either caused by more than one bacterial genera (polymicrobial) or by the infrequently found single bacterial genus such as Vibrio vulnificus or fungal genera such as Candida. Type 2 is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, and type 3 (or termed type 3 gas gangrene) is caused by Clostridium bacteria. Many investigators elect not to use this typing system and simply identify the organism(s) causing the necrotizing fasciitis. Bacteria cause most cases of necrotizing fasciitis; only rarely do other organisms such as fungi cause this disease. Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, either alone or with other bacteria, cause many cases of necrotizing fasciitis, although Clostridium bacteria should be considered as a cause especially if gas is found in the infected tissue. Because of better microbial isolation techniques for anaerobic (grow in the absence of oxygen) bacteria, bacterial genera such as Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium are often cultured from the infected area. Frequently, culture of tissue involved by necrotizing fasciitis also yields a mixture of other aerobic (require oxygen to grow) bacterial types such as E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and others. Many investigators conclude that non-anaerobic organisms damage tissue areas enough to cause local areas of hypoxia (reduced oxygen) where anaerobic organisms then can thrive and extend the infection further. This results in polymicrobial infection in which one type of bacteria aids the survival and growth of another type of bacteria (synergy). Infrequently, Vibrio vulnificus causes the disease when a person, usually someone with liver function problems (for example, alcoholics or immunosuppressed patients), eats contaminated seafood or a wound gets contaminated with seawater containing Vibrio vulnificus. Other organisms may rarely cause necrotizing fasciitis, but when they do, the resulting infections are often difficult to treat successfully. For example, Aeromonas hydrophila (a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium) was the source of this disease in a 24-year-old who cut her thigh in a homemade zip line accident in the U.S. Although Aeromonas hydrophila is usually associated with warm brackish water and causes infections in fish and amphibians, gastroenteritis is the disease it causes most often in humans when the water sources are swallowed. Because it is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate if it infects human tissues. In addition, once it infects tissues, its enzymes and toxins allow a rapid entrance of the organisms to the bloodstream, causing sepsis and infection of other body organs. In general, the bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis utilize similar methods to cause and advance the disease. In polymicrobial infections, one bacterial genus may produce one toxic factor (for example, E. coli causing tissue hypoxia) while different types of coinfecting bacteria may produce other toxins that lyse (disintegrate) damaged tissue cells or connective tissue. In general, this disease is not contagious, but the organisms that may lead to its development are contagious, usually by direct contact between people or items that can transfer the bacteria. People usually need a break in their skin (cut, abrasion) for these flesh-eating bacteria to cause disease. Theoretically, anyone with an infection has a small risk of getting necrotizing fasciitis; the risk factors begin to increase if the infection occurs in immunosuppressed individuals (for example, diabetics, elderly, infants, those with liver disease, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as chemotherapy for cancer). Visible infections (skin, hair follicles, fingernails, visible trauma sites) are more likely to be noticed and treated than some deep infections. Patients who have any deep infections (muscle, bone, joint, gastrointestinal) are at somewhat higher risk for the disease because the initial infection and subsequent spread is usually not as noticeable as more visible infections. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis, but there is still controversy about the cause of this disease. Necrotizing fasciitis has interesting demographics; more males than females are affected (about three to one), and Vibrio vulnificus infections seem limited to coastal areas with warm water where the organisms are found associated with seafood and contaminated water. Some patients can become septic (meaning the infection has spread to the bloodstream and throughout the body) before the skin changes are recognized, especially when flesh-eating disease begins in deep facial planes. Necrotizing fasciitis type 1 often occurs after trauma or surgery and may form little or undetectable amounts of gas. Type 3 usually occurs after trauma or after wounds become contaminated with dirt that contains Clostridium bacteria, which produce gas in tissues (gangrene) and necrotic eschars. However, symptoms for types 1-3 are not definitive, and symptoms vary widely which is why some investigators prefer to define individual patients' disease by the organism(s) isolated from the patient rather than assigning a type label. One set of patients that is being recognized with a more specific set of symptoms and health history are those infected with Vibrio vulnificus. The organisms occur in the warmer waters in the U.S. (Gulf of Mexico and southern coastal states) and elsewhere in the world with similar water conditions. Either ingesting the organisms or getting Vibrio vulnificus from contaminated seawater into skin abrasions or cuts can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Even though a single type of bacteria causes this infection, some investigators classify it as a variant of type 1 necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis (also termed NEC; necrosis of gastrointestinal tissue) occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis. Although investigators suggest that bacterial infection causes this disease, there is no definitive data to prove this and others attribute the disease to a dysfunction of the intestinal tissue. Often a preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is based on the patient's symptoms, including the medical and exposure history as described above. For example, a diabetic patient with a rectal fistula who develops pain, swelling, and scrotal skin changes may be preliminarily diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene, while another diabetic patient with liver failure and skin changes (bullae) and exposure to seawater may be preliminarily diagnosed with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. For example, the stain can distinguish between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and further distinguish their shapes (coccus or round, rod, or comma-shaped like Vibrio). Organisms isolated from necrotizing fasciitis need to have studies done to determine antibiotic resistance, because many organisms causing the disease are multidrug resistant. Although X-rays occasionally show gas in tissues, investigators suggest doing Doppler ultrasound, CT, or MRI studies to help show gas in tissues and to help delineate the extent of the infection. Most physicians run additional tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts (elevated in necrotizing fasciitis), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), sodium (decreased in necrotizing fasciitis), and other tests to monitor the patient. For example, testicular involvement would require a urologic surgeon, while necrotizing fasciitis involving the leg may require general surgeon, a plastic surgeon for skin/scar repair, and for vaginal necrotizing fasciitis, an OB/GYN surgeon. The initial choice of antibiotics can be made based upon the types of flesh-eating bacteria suspected of causing the infection, but many doctors believe that multiple antibiotics should be used at the same time to protect the patient from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, or sometimes termed flesh-eating bacteria in the popular press), as well as infections with anaerobic bacteria, and polymicrobial infections. A surgeon needs to be consulted immediately if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected or preliminarily diagnosed. As is the case for immediate antimicrobial therapy, early surgical treatment of most cases of necrotizing fasciitis can reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients with extensive disease may take months of treatment especially if they need skin grafting and/or plastic surgery. Necrotizing fasciitis does not begin unless an infection has already started in tissue; immediate effective treatment of any infection is likely to prevent the disease. Further, anything that can help prevent infections will help prevent necrotizing fasciitis. Practices such as hand washing, checking extremities for cuts or wounds if you have diabetes, avoiding physical contact with people who carry MRSA, and good hygiene practices help prevent initial infections that may lead to flesh-eating disease. Immunosuppressed patients should be very careful not to get infections, and people with liver disease should avoid eating seafood that may be contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus. People with liver disease should not have any infections or cuts in the skin exposed to warm seawater to avoid necrotizing fasciitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus. Cases of necrotizing fasciitis may occur when surgical sites become infected. Consequently, physicians need to use sterile techniques when doing surgery and adhere to hospital practices such as glove and gown coverage to help prevent infection spread in hospitalized patients. Careful surgical techniques in sites that can easily become contaminated are required. Some examples of such sites are bowel surgery, episiotomy (surgically enlarging the vaginal outlet), and debridement with closure of traumatic wounds. Necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious. However, it is possible for uninfected people to physically come into contact with some patients with the disease and become infected with an organism that may eventually cause necrotizing fasciitis. For example, a person could come in contact with a lesion containing MRSA organisms causing or contributing to the disease in another person and then become infected with MRSA. Transmission from one person to another usually requires direct contact with a patient or some item that can transfer organisms like MRSA to another person's skin; infection usually requires a skin break (cut or abrasion) for the organisms to establish an infection (cross-contamination of infected wounds). Combined mortality and morbidity (for example, limb loss, scar formation, renal (kidney) failure, and sepsis) for all cases of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported as 70%-80%. Cases of Fournier's gangrene have reported as high as 75% mortality rates, while cases of Vibrio vulnificus-associated necrotizing fasciitis have about a 50% mortality rate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007, made Vibrio vulnificus infection a reportable disease so the statistics on the incidence (frequency of occurrence) should be more easily obtained in the future. The worst complication of this disease is rapid advancement that results in death. \"Emergent Management of Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections.\" \"Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria).\" WebMD.com. <https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-bacteria-topic-overview>. \"Necrotizing Fasciitis.\" <http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/>. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue. Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria\nTypes of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods,  (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. This mainly involves  Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis\n\nEarly diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it.

How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis? Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Different types of bacterial infection can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious condition that is often associated with sepsis and widespread organ failure. Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs. Occasionally, mycotic (fungal) species cause necrotizing fasciitis. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a \"flesh eating\" or \"skin eating\" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or \"flesh-eating parasites\" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating bacterial infection or flesh-eating disease; suppurative fasciitis; dermal, Meleney, hospital, or Fournier's gangrene; and necrotizing cellulitis. Body regions frequently have the term necrotizing placed before them to describe the initial localization of necrotizing fasciitis (for example, necrotizing colitis, necrotizing arteriolitis), but they all refer to the same disease process in the tissue. Fortunately, this disease is relatively rare; various statistical sources estimate about 500 to 1,500 individuals are reported to have the disease per year in the U.S.\nStatistics show mortality (death) rates have been reported as high as 75% for necrotizing fasciitis associated with Fournier's (scrotal) gangrene, but the mortality in patients with the infection in other regions of the body (for example, legs or arms) is about 25%. Variations of necrotizing fasciitis are placed by some investigators into three general groups or types, roughly based on the type of organisms causing the infection and some clinical findings that vary from patient to patient. Type 1 is either caused by more than one bacterial genera (polymicrobial) or by the infrequently found single bacterial genus such as Vibrio vulnificus or fungal genera such as Candida. Type 2 is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, and type 3 (or termed type 3 gas gangrene) is caused by Clostridium bacteria. Many investigators elect not to use this typing system and simply identify the organism(s) causing the necrotizing fasciitis. Bacteria cause most cases of necrotizing fasciitis; only rarely do other organisms such as fungi cause this disease. Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, either alone or with other bacteria, cause many cases of necrotizing fasciitis, although Clostridium bacteria should be considered as a cause especially if gas is found in the infected tissue. Because of better microbial isolation techniques for anaerobic (grow in the absence of oxygen) bacteria, bacterial genera such as Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium are often cultured from the infected area. Frequently, culture of tissue involved by necrotizing fasciitis also yields a mixture of other aerobic (require oxygen to grow) bacterial types such as E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and others. Many investigators conclude that non-anaerobic organisms damage tissue areas enough to cause local areas of hypoxia (reduced oxygen) where anaerobic organisms then can thrive and extend the infection further. This results in polymicrobial infection in which one type of bacteria aids the survival and growth of another type of bacteria (synergy). Infrequently, Vibrio vulnificus causes the disease when a person, usually someone with liver function problems (for example, alcoholics or immunosuppressed patients), eats contaminated seafood or a wound gets contaminated with seawater containing Vibrio vulnificus. Other organisms may rarely cause necrotizing fasciitis, but when they do, the resulting infections are often difficult to treat successfully. For example, Aeromonas hydrophila (a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium) was the source of this disease in a 24-year-old who cut her thigh in a homemade zip line accident in the U.S. Although Aeromonas hydrophila is usually associated with warm brackish water and causes infections in fish and amphibians, gastroenteritis is the disease it causes most often in humans when the water sources are swallowed. Because it is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate if it infects human tissues. In addition, once it infects tissues, its enzymes and toxins allow a rapid entrance of the organisms to the bloodstream, causing sepsis and infection of other body organs. In general, the bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis utilize similar methods to cause and advance the disease. In polymicrobial infections, one bacterial genus may produce one toxic factor (for example, E. coli causing tissue hypoxia) while different types of coinfecting bacteria may produce other toxins that lyse (disintegrate) damaged tissue cells or connective tissue. In general, this disease is not contagious, but the organisms that may lead to its development are contagious, usually by direct contact between people or items that can transfer the bacteria. People usually need a break in their skin (cut, abrasion) for these flesh-eating bacteria to cause disease. Theoretically, anyone with an infection has a small risk of getting necrotizing fasciitis; the risk factors begin to increase if the infection occurs in immunosuppressed individuals (for example, diabetics, elderly, infants, those with liver disease, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as chemotherapy for cancer). Visible infections (skin, hair follicles, fingernails, visible trauma sites) are more likely to be noticed and treated than some deep infections. Patients who have any deep infections (muscle, bone, joint, gastrointestinal) are at somewhat higher risk for the disease because the initial infection and subsequent spread is usually not as noticeable as more visible infections. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis, but there is still controversy about the cause of this disease. Necrotizing fasciitis has interesting demographics; more males than females are affected (about three to one), and Vibrio vulnificus infections seem limited to coastal areas with warm water where the organisms are found associated with seafood and contaminated water. Some patients can become septic (meaning the infection has spread to the bloodstream and throughout the body) before the skin changes are recognized, especially when flesh-eating disease begins in deep facial planes. Necrotizing fasciitis type 1 often occurs after trauma or surgery and may form little or undetectable amounts of gas. Type 3 usually occurs after trauma or after wounds become contaminated with dirt that contains Clostridium bacteria, which produce gas in tissues (gangrene) and necrotic eschars. However, symptoms for types 1-3 are not definitive, and symptoms vary widely which is why some investigators prefer to define individual patients' disease by the organism(s) isolated from the patient rather than assigning a type label. One set of patients that is being recognized with a more specific set of symptoms and health history are those infected with Vibrio vulnificus. The organisms occur in the warmer waters in the U.S. (Gulf of Mexico and southern coastal states) and elsewhere in the world with similar water conditions. Either ingesting the organisms or getting Vibrio vulnificus from contaminated seawater into skin abrasions or cuts can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Even though a single type of bacteria causes this infection, some investigators classify it as a variant of type 1 necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing enterocolitis (also termed NEC; necrosis of gastrointestinal tissue) occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis. Although investigators suggest that bacterial infection causes this disease, there is no definitive data to prove this and others attribute the disease to a dysfunction of the intestinal tissue. Often a preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is based on the patient's symptoms, including the medical and exposure history as described above. For example, a diabetic patient with a rectal fistula who develops pain, swelling, and scrotal skin changes may be preliminarily diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene, while another diabetic patient with liver failure and skin changes (bullae) and exposure to seawater may be preliminarily diagnosed with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. For example, the stain can distinguish between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and further distinguish their shapes (coccus or round, rod, or comma-shaped like Vibrio). Organisms isolated from necrotizing fasciitis need to have studies done to determine antibiotic resistance, because many organisms causing the disease are multidrug resistant. Although X-rays occasionally show gas in tissues, investigators suggest doing Doppler ultrasound, CT, or MRI studies to help show gas in tissues and to help delineate the extent of the infection. Most physicians run additional tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts (elevated in necrotizing fasciitis), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), sodium (decreased in necrotizing fasciitis), and other tests to monitor the patient. For example, testicular involvement would require a urologic surgeon, while necrotizing fasciitis involving the leg may require general surgeon, a plastic surgeon for skin/scar repair, and for vaginal necrotizing fasciitis, an OB/GYN surgeon. The initial choice of antibiotics can be made based upon the types of flesh-eating bacteria suspected of causing the infection, but many doctors believe that multiple antibiotics should be used at the same time to protect the patient from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, or sometimes termed flesh-eating bacteria in the popular press), as well as infections with anaerobic bacteria, and polymicrobial infections. A surgeon needs to be consulted immediately if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected or preliminarily diagnosed. As is the case for immediate antimicrobial therapy, early surgical treatment of most cases of necrotizing fasciitis can reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients with extensive disease may take months of treatment especially if they need skin grafting and/or plastic surgery. Necrotizing fasciitis does not begin unless an infection has already started in tissue; immediate effective treatment of any infection is likely to prevent the disease. Further, anything that can help prevent infections will help prevent necrotizing fasciitis. Practices such as hand washing, checking extremities for cuts or wounds if you have diabetes, avoiding physical contact with people who carry MRSA, and good hygiene practices help prevent initial infections that may lead to flesh-eating disease. Immunosuppressed patients should be very careful not to get infections, and people with liver disease should avoid eating seafood that may be contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus. People with liver disease should not have any infections or cuts in the skin exposed to warm seawater to avoid necrotizing fasciitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus. Cases of necrotizing fasciitis may occur when surgical sites become infected. Consequently, physicians need to use sterile techniques when doing surgery and adhere to hospital practices such as glove and gown coverage to help prevent infection spread in hospitalized patients. Careful surgical techniques in sites that can easily become contaminated are required. Some examples of such sites are bowel surgery, episiotomy (surgically enlarging the vaginal outlet), and debridement with closure of traumatic wounds. Necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious. However, it is possible for uninfected people to physically come into contact with some patients with the disease and become infected with an organism that may eventually cause necrotizing fasciitis. For example, a person could come in contact with a lesion containing MRSA organisms causing or contributing to the disease in another person and then become infected with MRSA. Transmission from one person to another usually requires direct contact with a patient or some item that can transfer organisms like MRSA to another person's skin; infection usually requires a skin break (cut or abrasion) for the organisms to establish an infection (cross-contamination of infected wounds). Combined mortality and morbidity (for example, limb loss, scar formation, renal (kidney) failure, and sepsis) for all cases of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported as 70%-80%. Cases of Fournier's gangrene have reported as high as 75% mortality rates, while cases of Vibrio vulnificus-associated necrotizing fasciitis have about a 50% mortality rate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007, made Vibrio vulnificus infection a reportable disease so the statistics on the incidence (frequency of occurrence) should be more easily obtained in the future. The worst complication of this disease is rapid advancement that results in death. \"Emergent Management of Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections.\" \"Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria).\" WebMD.com. <https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-bacteria-topic-overview>. \"Necrotizing Fasciitis.\" <http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/>. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue. Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria\nTypes of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods,  (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. This mainly involves  Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis\n\nEarly diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it.

Are Endocrine Disruptors Disrupting Your Life? If you’re scratching your head and wondering what the heck an endocrine disruptor is, well, you’re not alone. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, or NIEHS (part of the National Institutes of Health), “endocrine disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with the body’s endocrine system and produce adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife.” And in case you need a refresher on what the endocrine system is, it’s the system of glands that produce hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Endocrine disruptors are found both in synthetic or man-made substances and their by-products, such as plastics, pesticides, and PCBs, as well as in natural substances, including phytoestrogens, which are hormone-like substances found in some plant foods. How do endocrine disruptors affect health? More and more evidence is pointing to the harmful effects of endocrine disruptors. A lot of attention is now focused on looking at these substances as a possible cause for Type 1 diabetes, given that this is an autoimmune disorder, as well as obesity. Endocrine disruptors likely pose the greatest risk to unborn and newborn infants when organ and nerve systems are developing. It’s also thought that these chemicals can affect the offspring of those who have been exposed, and even subsequent generations. What are examples of endocrine disruptors? The FDA deems BPA safe at low levels, but the concern is that BPA may be, in part, responsible for cancer, reproductive problems, heart disease, and obesity. Also, try to limit buying products marked with a “PC” for polycarbonate, or recycling label #7. Phthalates. Phthalates are chemicals that make plastics more malleable and help lotions be absorbed into the skin. They’re found in air fresheners, plastic toys, floor tile, cosmetics and personal care products, ink, vinyl, and food additives. Phthalates are linked with a low sperm count, lower sperm quality, malformations of the male reproductive system, and testicular cancer. Buy phthalate-free cosmetics, personal care products, and fragrances. Since atrazine is permissible in lows levels in our water supply, it’s hard to avoid it altogether. Administration (FDA) and USDA also routinely check food for the actual levels of pesticide residues. A US organic food advocacy group, the Environmental Working Group, is known for creating a list of fruits and vegetables referred to as the Dirty Dozen; it lists produce with the highest number of distinct pesticide residues or most samples with residue detected in USDA data. This list is generally considered misleading and lacks scientific credibility because it lists detections without accounting for the risk of the usually small amount of each residue with respect to consumer health.

The American Chemistry Council, an industry group, disputed the \"flawed study,\" pointing out it failed to show a causal link between BPA and obesity. \"Attempts to link our national obesity problem to minute exposures to chemicals found in common, everyday products are a distraction from the real efforts underway to address this important national health issue,\" the council said in a statement.

Are Endocrine Disruptors Disrupting Your Life? If you’re scratching your head and wondering what the heck an endocrine disruptor is, well, you’re not alone. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, or NIEHS (part of the National Institutes of Health), “endocrine disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with the body’s endocrine system and produce adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife.” And in case you need a refresher on what the endocrine system is, it’s the system of glands that produce hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Endocrine disruptors are found both in synthetic or man-made substances and their by-products, such as plastics, pesticides, and PCBs, as well as in natural substances, including phytoestrogens, which are hormone-like substances found in some plant foods. How do endocrine disruptors affect health? More and more evidence is pointing to the harmful effects of endocrine disruptors. A lot of attention is now focused on looking at these substances as a possible cause for Type 1 diabetes, given that this is an autoimmune disorder, as well as obesity. Endocrine disruptors likely pose the greatest risk to unborn and newborn infants when organ and nerve systems are developing. It’s also thought that these chemicals can affect the offspring of those who have been exposed, and even subsequent generations. What are examples of endocrine disruptors? The FDA deems BPA safe at low levels, but the concern is that BPA may be, in part, responsible for cancer, reproductive problems, heart disease, and obesity. Also, try to limit buying products marked with a “PC” for polycarbonate, or recycling label #7. Phthalates. Phthalates are chemicals that make plastics more malleable and help lotions be absorbed into the skin. They’re found in air fresheners, plastic toys, floor tile, cosmetics and personal care products, ink, vinyl, and food additives. Phthalates are linked with a low sperm count, lower sperm quality, malformations of the male reproductive system, and testicular cancer. Buy phthalate-free cosmetics, personal care products, and fragrances. Since atrazine is permissible in lows levels in our water supply, it’s hard to avoid it altogether. Administration (FDA) and USDA also routinely check food for the actual levels of pesticide residues. A US organic food advocacy group, the Environmental Working Group, is known for creating a list of fruits and vegetables referred to as the Dirty Dozen; it lists produce with the highest number of distinct pesticide residues or most samples with residue detected in USDA data. This list is generally considered misleading and lacks scientific credibility because it lists detections without accounting for the risk of the usually small amount of each residue with respect to consumer health. Many substances include its strong acid salts ; Airborne particles of many substances are cancerogenic ; Several chemical commodities were removed in the last years ; Bisphenol A (BPA) was removed from the list on April 19, 2013, and was relisted on May 11, 2015.\n\n"

Rofecoxib was approved in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. In 2005 the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious CV events than non-selective NSAIDs. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics\nThe therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. Efficacy \nRofecoxib was approved by the FDA to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Fabricated efficacy studies\nOn March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated, overstating the analgesic effects of the drugs. Side effects\n\nIn addition to the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits no effect on bleeding time or platelet aggregation, even at supra-therapeutic doses. Heart and blood vessels\n\nVIGOR study and publishing controversy\nThe VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. Renowned research cardiologist Eric Topol, a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of \"manipulation of data\" and said \"I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up\". Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\". The Journal stated that NEJMs \"ambiguous\" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; \"the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected.\" Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information. The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. Alzheimer's disease\nIn 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. APPROVe study\nIn 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to CV risk. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report it had commissioned, and promised to consider the recommendations. FDA position\nIn 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Litigation\nBy March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the NEJM editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 5, 2006, a jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale. Possible return to market\nIn November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. In March 2019 Tremeau announced that they had hired as chief development officer a former Merck employee who had been a product development team leader and also was responsible for executive oversight for numerous clinical trials for the COX-2 inhibitor VIOXX (rofecoxib).

Rofecoxib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib’s risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Interestingly, at the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Drug manufacturer Merckhad no comment on the disclosure. The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12 month span of the study.

Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the NEJM editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 5, 2006, a jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale. Possible return to market\nIn November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. In March 2019 Tremeau announced that they had hired as chief development officer a former Merck employee who had been a product development team leader and also was responsible for executive oversight for numerous clinical trials for the COX-2 inhibitor VIOXX (rofecoxib).

It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions, and dysmenorrhoea. Rofecoxib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib’s risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Interestingly, at the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Drug manufacturer Merckhad no comment on the disclosure. The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12 month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The editors charged that “more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.” These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the “aspirin not indicated” group) and the editors noted that the omission “resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.” The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statitistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for theprophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (includingheart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. In 2005, advisory panels in both the U.S. and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that rofecoxib’s benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. In 2005, Merck retained Debevoise & Plimpton LLP to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. Through the report, it was found that Merck’s senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team’s overzealous behavior. Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have voted, by a narrow margin, that it should not ban Vioxx — the painkiller withdrawn by drug-maker Merck. url = http://www.nature.com/drugdisc/news/articles/433790b.html The recommendations of the arthritis and drug safety advisory panel offer some measure of relief to the pharmaceutical industry, which has faced a barrage of criticism for its promotion of the painkillers.\n\n"

The court noted that large sums of unexplained currency can be evidence of drug trafficking, and that in this case the money was bundled in an unusual manner. at 12), and that \"the bundling is consistent with an attempt to sort the currency by contributor and conceal the currency from would-be thieves,\" and not just to evade law enforcement. In addition, the court observed that the government had not presented any expert testimony about \"whether the manner the bundles were wrapped either increased or decreased the likelihood of the currency's use or connection with a drug trafficking offense.\" A cigarette is a narrow cylinder containing burnable material, typically tobacco, that is rolled into thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end, causing it to smolder; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end. Manufacturers have described the cigarette as \"a drug administration system for the delivery of nicotine in acceptable and attractive form.\" The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but the word is sometimes used to refer to other substances, such as a cannabis (Jazz) cigarette or an herbal cigarette. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is typically white. Many other terms are used for cigarettes, including cigs, ciggies, smokes, darts, stogs, boges, and tabs. Researchers have identified negative health effects from smoking cigarettes such as  cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and other health problems relating to nearly every organ of the body. Nicotine, the psychoactive drug in tobacco, makes cigarettes highly addictive. Every year, tobacco cigarettes kill more than 8 million people worldwide; with 1.2 million of those being non-smokers dying as the result of exposure to second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes causes many of the same health problems as smoking, including cancer, which has led to legislation and policy that has prohibited smoking in many workplaces and public areas. Cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, including arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead, carbon monoxide, acrolein, and other poisonous substances. Most modern cigarettes are filtered, although this does not make the smoke inhaled from them contain fewer carcinogens and harmful chemicals. Cigarette use by pregnant women has also been shown to cause birth defects, including low birth weight, fetal abnormalities, and premature birth. Smoking rates have generally declined in the developed world, but continue to rise in some developing nations. Most nations outright ban commercials on cigarettes and have levied taxes on them to dissuade smokers to continue the habit. The first country to introduce a large scale antismoking campaign was Nazi Germany and despite its minimal success it did create a blueprint for many other nations to follow. In the 21st century, a product called an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette or vape) was developed, in which the substance contained within it (typically a liquid solution containing nicotine) is vaporized by a battery-powered heating element, as opposed to being burned. Such devices are commonly promoted by their manufacturers as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, although there are some health risks associated with their use. Because e-cigarettes are a relatively new product, scientists do not possess data on their possible long-term health effects. As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic, inhaling may have become perceived as more agreeable. The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. In 1975, the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in military rations. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking started to become widely known and text-only health warnings became common on cigarette packets. The United States has not implemented graphical cigarette warning labels, which are considered a more effective method to communicate to the public the dangers of cigarette smoking. Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Romania, Singapore, Egypt, Jordan, Nepal and Turkey, however, have both textual warnings and graphic visual images displaying, among other things, the damaging effects tobacco use has on the human body. Since 1950, the average nicotine and tar content of cigarettes has steadily fallen. A key ingredient that makes cigarettes more addictive is the inclusion of reconstituted tobacco, which has additives to make nicotine more volatile as the cigarette burns. The papers used in tipping the cigarette (forming the mouthpiece) and surrounding the filter stabilize the mouthpiece from saliva and moderate the burning of the cigarette, as well as the delivery of smoke with the presence of one or two rows of small laser-drilled air holes. To improve the economics of producing cigarettes, these byproducts are processed separately into forms where they can then be added back into the cigarette blend without an apparent or marked change in the cigarette's quality. Most commercially available cigarettes today contain tobacco that is treated with butterfat and sugar to mask the bitter taste of nicotine. Tobacco companies also use tobacco that has been freebased or modified to increase the speed of nicotine delivery. According to data from the World Health Organization, the amount of tobacco per 1000 cigarettes fell from  in 1960 to  in 1999, largely as a result of reconstituting tobacco, fluffing, and additives. Additives \n\nVarious additives are combined into the shredded tobacco product mixtures, with humectants such as propylene glycol or glycerol, as well as flavoring products and enhancers such as cocoa solids, licorice, tobacco extracts, and various sugars, which are known collectively as \"casings\". A perfume-like flavor/fragrance, called the \"topping\" or \"toppings\", which is most often formulated by flavor companies, is then blended into the tobacco mixture to improve the consistency in flavor and taste of the cigarettes associated with a certain brand name. A list of 599 cigarette additives, created by five major American cigarette companies, was approved by the Department of Health and Human Services in April 1994. This process, known as freebasing, could potentially increase the effect of nicotine on the smoker, but experimental data suggests that absorption is, in practice, unaffected. They have an appearance similar to a finished cigarette, but are without any tobacco or smoking material inside. Filling a cigarette tube is usually done with a cigarette injector (also known as a shooter). Cigarette filter \nA cigarette filter or filter tip is a component of a cigarette. Most factory-made cigarettes are equipped with a filter; those who roll their own can buy them separately. Filters can reduce some substances from smoke but do not make cigarettes any safer to smoke. Cigarette butts accumulate outside buildings, on parking lots, and streets where they can be transported through storm drains to streams, rivers, and beaches. Electronic cigarette \n\nAn electronic cigarette is a handheld battery-powered vaporizer that simulates smoking by providing some of the behavioral aspects of smoking, including the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, but without combusting tobacco. Using an e-cigarette is known as \"vaping\" and the user is referred to as a \"vaper.\" Instead of cigarette smoke, the user inhales an aerosol, commonly called vapor. E-cigarettes typically have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid. E-cigarettes are automatically activated by taking a puff; others turn on manually by pressing a button. Some e-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations. E-liquids usually contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and differing amounts of contaminants. E-liquids are also sold without propylene glycol, nicotine, or flavors. The benefits and the health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain. Their part in tobacco harm reduction is unclear, while another review found they appear to have the potential to lower tobacco-related death and disease. Regulated US Food and Drug Administration nicotine replacement products may be safer than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are generally seen as safer than combusted tobacco products. It is estimated their safety risk to users is similar to that of smokeless tobacco. The long-term effects of e-cigarette use are unknown. In 2019 and 2020, an outbreak of severe lung illness throughout the US was linked to the use of vaping products\n\nE-cigarettes create vapor made of fine and ultrafine particles of particulate matter, which have been found to contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavors, small amounts of toxicants, carcinogens, and heavy metals, as well as metal nanoparticles, and other substances. E-cigarette vapor potentially contains harmful chemicals not found in tobacco smoke. E-cigarette vapor contains fewer toxic chemicals, and lower concentrations of potential toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke. People keep smoking because the nicotine, the primary psychoactive chemical in cigarettes, is highly addictive. Cigarettes, like narcotics, have been described as \"strategically addictive,\" with the addictive properties being a core component of the business strategy. Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). On average, each cigarette smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes. The World Health Organization  estimates that tobacco kills 8 million people each year as of 2019 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. \"Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease\", it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as nonsmokers to survive to the age of 80. Gateway theory \nA very strong argument can be made about the association between adolescent exposure to nicotine by smoking conventional cigarettes and the subsequent onset of using other dependence-producing substances. Strong, temporal, and dose-dependent associations have been reported, and a plausible biological mechanism (via rodent and human modeling) suggests that long-term changes in the neural reward system take place as a result of adolescent smoking. Adolescent smokers of conventional cigarettes have disproportionately high rates of comorbid substance use, and longitudinal studies have suggested that early adolescent smoking may be a starting point or \"gateway\" for substance use later in life, with this effect more likely for persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, behavioral studies in adolescent and young adult smokers have revealed an increased propensity for risk-taking, both generally and in the presence of peers, and neuroimaging studies have shown altered frontal neural activation during a risk-taking task as compared with nonsmokers. In 2011, Rubinstein and colleagues used neuroimaging to show decreased brain response to a natural reinforcer (pleasurable food cues) in adolescent light smokers (1–5 cigarettes per day), with their results highlighting the possibility of neural alterations consistent with nicotine dependence and altered brain response to reward even in adolescent low-level smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air for hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections, and asthma. Nonsmokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Legislation \n\n Smoking restrictions \n\nMany governments impose restrictions on smoking tobacco, especially in public areas. The primary justification has been the negative health effects of second-hand smoke. Nearly all countries have laws restricting places where people can smoke in public, and over 40 countries have comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in virtually all public venues. Bhutan is currently the only country in the world to completely outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco and tobacco products under the Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted as long as the possessors can prove that they have paid import duties. Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000. In March 2012, Brazil became the world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco including menthols. This regulation applies to domestic and imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers had 18 months to remove the noncompliant cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of noncompliant tobacco. Australia, New Zealand, Poland, and Pakistan have a nationwide ban on the selling of all tobacco products to people under the age of 18. Since 1 October 2007, it has been illegal for retailers to sell tobacco in all forms to people under the age of 18 in three of the UK's four constituent countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland), rising from 16. It is also illegal to sell lighters, rolling papers, and all other tobacco-associated items to people under 18. It is not illegal for people under 18 to buy or smoke tobacco, just as it was not previously for people under 16; it is only illegal for the said retailer to sell the item. In the Republic of Ireland, bans on the sale of the smaller 10-packs and confectionery that resembles tobacco products (candy cigarettes) came into force on May 31, 2007, in a bid to cut underaged smoking. Since January 1, 2007, all cigarette machines in public places in Germany must attempt to verify a customer's age by requiring the insertion of a debit card. Since July 2008, Japan has enforced this age limit at cigarette vending machines through use of the taspo smart card. In other countries, such as Egypt, it is legal to use and purchase tobacco products regardless of age. Some police departments in the United States occasionally send an underaged teenager into a store where cigarettes are sold, and have the teen attempt to purchase cigarettes, with their own or no ID. If the vendor then completes the sale, the store is issued a fine. Similar enforcement practices are regularly performed by Trading Standards officers in the UK, Israel, and  the Republic of Ireland. Taxation \n\nCigarettes are taxed both to reduce use, especially among youth, and to raise revenue. Higher prices for cigarettes discourage smoking. Every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by about 7% and overall cigarette consumption by about 4%. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that globally cigarettes be taxed at a rate of three-quarters of cigarettes sale price as a way of deterring cancer and other negative health outcomes. This fact has historically been an impediment for health groups seeking to discourage cigarette smoking, since governments seek to maximize tax revenues. Furthermore, some countries have made cigarettes a state monopoly, which has the same effect on the attitude of government officials outside the health field. In the United States, states are a primary determinant of the total tax rate on cigarettes. Generally, states that rely on tobacco as a significant farm product tend to tax cigarettes at a low rate. As part of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the federal government collects user fees to fund Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory measures over tobacco. Fire-safe cigarette\n\nCigarettes are a frequent source of deadly fires in private homes, which prompted both the European Union and the United States to require cigarettes to be fire-standard compliant. According to Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, reduction of burning agents in cigarettes would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes. Since the 1980s, prominent cigarette manufacturers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds developed fire safe cigarettes, but did not market them. These cigarettes have a reduced idle burning speed which allows them to self-extinguish. The European Union in 2011 banned cigarettes that do not meet a fire-safety standard. According to a study made by the European Union in 16 European countries, 11,000 fires were due to people carelessly handling cigarettes between 2005 and 2007. Cigarette advertising \n\nMany countries have restrictions on cigarette advertising, promotion, sponsorship, and marketing. Warning messages in packages \n\nAs a result of tight advertising and marketing prohibitions, tobacco companies look at the pack differently: they view it as a strong component in displaying brand imagery and a creating significant in-store presence at the point of purchase. Studies also show how companies have manipulated a variety of elements in packs designs to communicate the impression of lower in tar or milder cigarettes, whereas the components were the same. Some countries require cigarette packs to contain warnings about health hazards. The United States was the first, later followed by other countries including Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Pakistan, India, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In response to these regulations, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco Inc., British American Tobacco Plc., and Imperial Tobacco attempted to sue the Australian government. On August 15, 2012, the High Court of Australia dismissed the suit and made Australia the first country to introduce brand-free plain cigarette packaging with health warnings covering 90 and 70% of back and front packaging, respectively. Cigarette filters are the most common form of litter in the world, as approximately 5.6 trillion cigarettes are smoked every year worldwide. Of those, an estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette filters become litter every year. Discarded cigarette filters usually end up in the water system through drainage ditches and are transported by rivers and other waterways to the ocean. Cigarette filters contain the chemicals filtered from cigarettes and can leach into waterways and water supplies. The toxicity of used cigarette filters depends on the specific tobacco blend and additives used by the cigarette companies. After a cigarette is smoked, the filter retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of cigarette filters, the various chemicals that can be found in cigarette filters are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole cigarette filter and its LD50. One recent study has looked at the toxicity of smoked cigarette filters (smoked filter + tobacco), smoked cigarette filters (no tobacco), and unsmoked cigarette filters (no tobacco). Other health concerns \nToxic chemicals are not the only human health concern to take into considerations; the others are cellulose acetate and carbon particles that are breathed in while smoking. A connection exists between cigarette filters introduced to soil and the depletion of some soil nutrients over a period time. Another health concern to the environment is not only the toxic carcinogens that are harmful to the wildlife, but also the filters themselves pose an ingestion risk to wildlife that may presume filter litter as food. Smoldering cigarette filters have also been blamed for triggering fires from residential areas to major wildfires and bushfires which has caused major property damage and also death as well as disruption to services by triggering alarms and warning systems. Another method is making fines and penalties for littering filters; many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette filters; for example, Washington imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters. The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment in which to discard cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact. Consumption \n\nSmoking has become less popular, but is still a large public health problem globally. In 2017, 5.4 trillion cigarettes were produced globally, and were smoked by almost 1 billion people. Smoking rates have leveled off or declined in most countries, but is increasing in some low- and middle-income countries. The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined. Other regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use. Within countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults. Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs. Other countries have considered similar measures. Lights \n\nSome cigarettes are marketed as \"Lights\", \"Milds\", or \"Low-tar.\" These cigarettes were historically marketed as being less harmful, but there is no research showing that they are any less harmful. The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter. In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the tobacco smoke with clean air. In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations. In ultralight cigarettes, the filter's perforations are larger. Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands. Research shows that smoking \"light\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes is just as harmful as smoking other cigarettes. The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In 2019, the FDA authorized the selling of low-nicotine cigarettes in hopes of lowering the number of people addicted to nicotine.

The United States has not implemented graphical cigarette warning labels, which are considered a more effective method to communicate to the public the dangers of cigarette smoking. Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Romania, Singapore, Egypt, Jordan, Nepal and Turkey, however, have both textual warnings and graphic visual images displaying, among other things, the damaging effects tobacco use has on the human body. Since 1950, the average nicotine and tar content of cigarettes has steadily fallen. A key ingredient that makes cigarettes more addictive is the inclusion of reconstituted tobacco, which has additives to make nicotine more volatile as the cigarette burns. The papers used in tipping the cigarette (forming the mouthpiece) and surrounding the filter stabilize the mouthpiece from saliva and moderate the burning of the cigarette, as well as the delivery of smoke with the presence of one or two rows of small laser-drilled air holes. To improve the economics of producing cigarettes, these byproducts are processed separately into forms where they can then be added back into the cigarette blend without an apparent or marked change in the cigarette's quality. Most commercially available cigarettes today contain tobacco that is treated with butterfat and sugar to mask the bitter taste of nicotine. Tobacco companies also use tobacco that has been freebased or modified to increase the speed of nicotine delivery. According to data from the World Health Organization, the amount of tobacco per 1000 cigarettes fell from  in 1960 to  in 1999, largely as a result of reconstituting tobacco, fluffing, and additives. Additives \n\nVarious additives are combined into the shredded tobacco product mixtures, with humectants such as propylene glycol or glycerol, as well as flavoring products and enhancers such as cocoa solids, licorice, tobacco extracts, and various sugars, which are known collectively as \"casings\". A perfume-like flavor/fragrance, called the \"topping\" or \"toppings\", which is most often formulated by flavor companies, is then blended into the tobacco mixture to improve the consistency in flavor and taste of the cigarettes associated with a certain brand name. A list of 599 cigarette additives, created by five major American cigarette companies, was approved by the Department of Health and Human Services in April 1994. This process, known as freebasing, could potentially increase the effect of nicotine on the smoker, but experimental data suggests that absorption is, in practice, unaffected. They have an appearance similar to a finished cigarette, but are without any tobacco or smoking material inside. Filling a cigarette tube is usually done with a cigarette injector (also known as a shooter). Cigarette filter \nA cigarette filter or filter tip is a component of a cigarette. Most factory-made cigarettes are equipped with a filter; those who roll their own can buy them separately. Filters can reduce some substances from smoke but do not make cigarettes any safer to smoke. Cigarette butts accumulate outside buildings, on parking lots, and streets where they can be transported through storm drains to streams, rivers, and beaches. Electronic cigarette \n\nAn electronic cigarette is a handheld battery-powered vaporizer that simulates smoking by providing some of the behavioral aspects of smoking, including the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, but without combusting tobacco. Using an e-cigarette is known as \"vaping\" and the user is referred to as a \"vaper.\" Instead of cigarette smoke, the user inhales an aerosol, commonly called vapor. E-cigarettes typically have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid. E-cigarettes are automatically activated by taking a puff; others turn on manually by pressing a button. Some e-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations. E-liquids usually contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and differing amounts of contaminants. E-liquids are also sold without propylene glycol, nicotine, or flavors. The benefits and the health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain. Their part in tobacco harm reduction is unclear, while another review found they appear to have the potential to lower tobacco-related death and disease. Regulated US Food and Drug Administration nicotine replacement products may be safer than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are generally seen as safer than combusted tobacco products. It is estimated their safety risk to users is similar to that of smokeless tobacco. The long-term effects of e-cigarette use are unknown. In 2019 and 2020, an outbreak of severe lung illness throughout the US was linked to the use of vaping products\n\nE-cigarettes create vapor made of fine and ultrafine particles of particulate matter, which have been found to contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavors, small amounts of toxicants, carcinogens, and heavy metals, as well as metal nanoparticles, and other substances. E-cigarette vapor potentially contains harmful chemicals not found in tobacco smoke. E-cigarette vapor contains fewer toxic chemicals, and lower concentrations of potential toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke. People keep smoking because the nicotine, the primary psychoactive chemical in cigarettes, is highly addictive. Cigarettes, like narcotics, have been described as \"strategically addictive,\" with the addictive properties being a core component of the business strategy. Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). On average, each cigarette smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes. The World Health Organization  estimates that tobacco kills 8 million people each year as of 2019 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. \"Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease\", it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as nonsmokers to survive to the age of 80. Gateway theory \nA very strong argument can be made about the association between adolescent exposure to nicotine by smoking conventional cigarettes and the subsequent onset of using other dependence-producing substances. Strong, temporal, and dose-dependent associations have been reported, and a plausible biological mechanism (via rodent and human modeling) suggests that long-term changes in the neural reward system take place as a result of adolescent smoking. Adolescent smokers of conventional cigarettes have disproportionately high rates of comorbid substance use, and longitudinal studies have suggested that early adolescent smoking may be a starting point or \"gateway\" for substance use later in life, with this effect more likely for persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, behavioral studies in adolescent and young adult smokers have revealed an increased propensity for risk-taking, both generally and in the presence of peers, and neuroimaging studies have shown altered frontal neural activation during a risk-taking task as compared with nonsmokers. In 2011, Rubinstein and colleagues used neuroimaging to show decreased brain response to a natural reinforcer (pleasurable food cues) in adolescent light smokers (1–5 cigarettes per day), with their results highlighting the possibility of neural alterations consistent with nicotine dependence and altered brain response to reward even in adolescent low-level smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air for hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections, and asthma. Nonsmokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Legislation \n\n Smoking restrictions \n\nMany governments impose restrictions on smoking tobacco, especially in public areas. The primary justification has been the negative health effects of second-hand smoke. Nearly all countries have laws restricting places where people can smoke in public, and over 40 countries have comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in virtually all public venues. Bhutan is currently the only country in the world to completely outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco and tobacco products under the Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted as long as the possessors can prove that they have paid import duties. Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000. In March 2012, Brazil became the world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco including menthols. This regulation applies to domestic and imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers had 18 months to remove the noncompliant cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of noncompliant tobacco. Australia, New Zealand, Poland, and Pakistan have a nationwide ban on the selling of all tobacco products to people under the age of 18. Since 1 October 2007, it has been illegal for retailers to sell tobacco in all forms to people under the age of 18 in three of the UK's four constituent countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland), rising from 16. It is also illegal to sell lighters, rolling papers, and all other tobacco-associated items to people under 18. It is not illegal for people under 18 to buy or smoke tobacco, just as it was not previously for people under 16; it is only illegal for the said retailer to sell the item. In the Republic of Ireland, bans on the sale of the smaller 10-packs and confectionery that resembles tobacco products (candy cigarettes) came into force on May 31, 2007, in a bid to cut underaged smoking. Since January 1, 2007, all cigarette machines in public places in Germany must attempt to verify a customer's age by requiring the insertion of a debit card. Since July 2008, Japan has enforced this age limit at cigarette vending machines through use of the taspo smart card. In other countries, such as Egypt, it is legal to use and purchase tobacco products regardless of age. Some police departments in the United States occasionally send an underaged teenager into a store where cigarettes are sold, and have the teen attempt to purchase cigarettes, with their own or no ID. If the vendor then completes the sale, the store is issued a fine. Similar enforcement practices are regularly performed by Trading Standards officers in the UK, Israel, and  the Republic of Ireland. Taxation \n\nCigarettes are taxed both to reduce use, especially among youth, and to raise revenue. Higher prices for cigarettes discourage smoking. Every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by about 7% and overall cigarette consumption by about 4%. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that globally cigarettes be taxed at a rate of three-quarters of cigarettes sale price as a way of deterring cancer and other negative health outcomes. Cigarette sales are a significant source of tax revenue in many localities. This fact has historically been an impediment for health groups seeking to discourage cigarette smoking, since governments seek to maximize tax revenues. Furthermore, some countries have made cigarettes a state monopoly, which has the same effect on the attitude of government officials outside the health field. In the United States, states are a primary determinant of the total tax rate on cigarettes. Generally, states that rely on tobacco as a significant farm product tend to tax cigarettes at a low rate. As part of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the federal government collects user fees to fund Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory measures over tobacco. Fire-safe cigarette\n\nCigarettes are a frequent source of deadly fires in private homes, which prompted both the European Union and the United States to require cigarettes to be fire-standard compliant. According to Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, reduction of burning agents in cigarettes would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes. Since the 1980s, prominent cigarette manufacturers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds developed fire safe cigarettes, but did not market them. These cigarettes have a reduced idle burning speed which allows them to self-extinguish. The European Union in 2011 banned cigarettes that do not meet a fire-safety standard. According to a study made by the European Union in 16 European countries, 11,000 fires were due to people carelessly handling cigarettes between 2005 and 2007. Cigarette advertising \n\nMany countries have restrictions on cigarette advertising, promotion, sponsorship, and marketing. Warning messages in packages \n\nAs a result of tight advertising and marketing prohibitions, tobacco companies look at the pack differently: they view it as a strong component in displaying brand imagery and a creating significant in-store presence at the point of purchase. Studies also show how companies have manipulated a variety of elements in packs designs to communicate the impression of lower in tar or milder cigarettes, whereas the components were the same. Some countries require cigarette packs to contain warnings about health hazards. The United States was the first, later followed by other countries including Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Pakistan, India, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In response to these regulations, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco Inc., British American Tobacco Plc., and Imperial Tobacco attempted to sue the Australian government. On August 15, 2012, the High Court of Australia dismissed the suit and made Australia the first country to introduce brand-free plain cigarette packaging with health warnings covering 90 and 70% of back and front packaging, respectively. Cigarette filters are the most common form of litter in the world, as approximately 5.6 trillion cigarettes are smoked every year worldwide. Of those, an estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette filters become litter every year. Discarded cigarette filters usually end up in the water system through drainage ditches and are transported by rivers and other waterways to the ocean. Cigarette filters contain the chemicals filtered from cigarettes and can leach into waterways and water supplies. The toxicity of used cigarette filters depends on the specific tobacco blend and additives used by the cigarette companies. After a cigarette is smoked, the filter retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of cigarette filters, the various chemicals that can be found in cigarette filters are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole cigarette filter and its LD50. One recent study has looked at the toxicity of smoked cigarette filters (smoked filter + tobacco), smoked cigarette filters (no tobacco), and unsmoked cigarette filters (no tobacco). Other health concerns \nToxic chemicals are not the only human health concern to take into considerations; the others are cellulose acetate and carbon particles that are breathed in while smoking. A connection exists between cigarette filters introduced to soil and the depletion of some soil nutrients over a period time. Another health concern to the environment is not only the toxic carcinogens that are harmful to the wildlife, but also the filters themselves pose an ingestion risk to wildlife that may presume filter litter as food. Smoldering cigarette filters have also been blamed for triggering fires from residential areas to major wildfires and bushfires which has caused major property damage and also death as well as disruption to services by triggering alarms and warning systems. Another method is making fines and penalties for littering filters; many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette filters; for example, Washington imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters. The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment in which to discard cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact. Consumption \n\nSmoking has become less popular, but is still a large public health problem globally. In 2017, 5.4 trillion cigarettes were produced globally, and were smoked by almost 1 billion people. Smoking rates have leveled off or declined in most countries, but is increasing in some low- and middle-income countries. The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined. Other regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use. Within countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults. Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs. Other countries have considered similar measures. Lights \n\nSome cigarettes are marketed as \"Lights\", \"Milds\", or \"Low-tar.\" These cigarettes were historically marketed as being less harmful, but there is no research showing that they are any less harmful. The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter. In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the tobacco smoke with clean air. In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations. In ultralight cigarettes, the filter's perforations are larger. Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands. Research shows that smoking \"light\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes is just as harmful as smoking other cigarettes. The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In 2019, the FDA authorized the selling of low-nicotine cigarettes in hopes of lowering the number of people addicted to nicotine.

The court noted that large sums of unexplained currency can be evidence of drug trafficking, and that in this case the money was bundled in an unusual manner. at 12), and that \"the bundling is consistent with an attempt to sort the currency by contributor and conceal the currency from would-be thieves,\" and not just to evade law enforcement. In addition, the court observed that the government had not presented any expert testimony about \"whether the manner the bundles were wrapped either increased or decreased the likelihood of the currency's use or connection with a drug trafficking offense.\" A cigarette is a narrow cylinder containing burnable material, typically tobacco, that is rolled into thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end, causing it to smolder; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end. Manufacturers have described the cigarette as \"a drug administration system for the delivery of nicotine in acceptable and attractive form.\" The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but the word is sometimes used to refer to other substances, such as a cannabis (Jazz) cigarette or an herbal cigarette. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is typically white. Many other terms are used for cigarettes, including cigs, ciggies, smokes, darts, stogs, boges, and tabs. Researchers have identified negative health effects from smoking cigarettes such as  cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and other health problems relating to nearly every organ of the body. Nicotine, the psychoactive drug in tobacco, makes cigarettes highly addictive. Every year, tobacco cigarettes kill more than 8 million people worldwide; with 1.2 million of those being non-smokers dying as the result of exposure to second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes causes many of the same health problems as smoking, including cancer, which has led to legislation and policy that has prohibited smoking in many workplaces and public areas. Cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, including arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead, carbon monoxide, acrolein, and other poisonous substances. Most modern cigarettes are filtered, although this does not make the smoke inhaled from them contain fewer carcinogens and harmful chemicals. Cigarette use by pregnant women has also been shown to cause birth defects, including low birth weight, fetal abnormalities, and premature birth. Smoking rates have generally declined in the developed world, but continue to rise in some developing nations. Most nations outright ban commercials on cigarettes and have levied taxes on them to dissuade smokers to continue the habit. The first country to introduce a large scale antismoking campaign was Nazi Germany and despite its minimal success it did create a blueprint for many other nations to follow. In the 21st century, a product called an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette or vape) was developed, in which the substance contained within it (typically a liquid solution containing nicotine) is vaporized by a battery-powered heating element, as opposed to being burned. Such devices are commonly promoted by their manufacturers as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, although there are some health risks associated with their use. Because e-cigarettes are a relatively new product, scientists do not possess data on their possible long-term health effects. As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic, inhaling may have become perceived as more agreeable. The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. In 1975, the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in military rations.

Since the 1980s, prominent cigarette manufacturers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds developed fire safe cigarettes, but did not market them. These cigarettes have a reduced idle burning speed which allows them to self-extinguish. The European Union in 2011 banned cigarettes that do not meet a fire-safety standard. According to a study made by the European Union in 16 European countries, 11,000 fires were due to people carelessly handling cigarettes between 2005 and 2007. Cigarette advertising \n\nMany countries have restrictions on cigarette advertising, promotion, sponsorship, and marketing. Warning messages in packages \n\nAs a result of tight advertising and marketing prohibitions, tobacco companies look at the pack differently: they view it as a strong component in displaying brand imagery and a creating significant in-store presence at the point of purchase. Studies also show how companies have manipulated a variety of elements in packs designs to communicate the impression of lower in tar or milder cigarettes, whereas the components were the same. Some countries require cigarette packs to contain warnings about health hazards. The United States was the first, later followed by other countries including Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Pakistan, India, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In response to these regulations, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco Inc., British American Tobacco Plc., and Imperial Tobacco attempted to sue the Australian government. On August 15, 2012, the High Court of Australia dismissed the suit and made Australia the first country to introduce brand-free plain cigarette packaging with health warnings covering 90 and 70% of back and front packaging, respectively. Cigarette filters are the most common form of litter in the world, as approximately 5.6 trillion cigarettes are smoked every year worldwide. Of those, an estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette filters become litter every year. Discarded cigarette filters usually end up in the water system through drainage ditches and are transported by rivers and other waterways to the ocean. Cigarette filters contain the chemicals filtered from cigarettes and can leach into waterways and water supplies. The toxicity of used cigarette filters depends on the specific tobacco blend and additives used by the cigarette companies. After a cigarette is smoked, the filter retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of cigarette filters, the various chemicals that can be found in cigarette filters are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole cigarette filter and its LD50. One recent study has looked at the toxicity of smoked cigarette filters (smoked filter + tobacco), smoked cigarette filters (no tobacco), and unsmoked cigarette filters (no tobacco). Other health concerns \nToxic chemicals are not the only human health concern to take into considerations; the others are cellulose acetate and carbon particles that are breathed in while smoking. A connection exists between cigarette filters introduced to soil and the depletion of some soil nutrients over a period time. Another health concern to the environment is not only the toxic carcinogens that are harmful to the wildlife, but also the filters themselves pose an ingestion risk to wildlife that may presume filter litter as food. Smoldering cigarette filters have also been blamed for triggering fires from residential areas to major wildfires and bushfires which has caused major property damage and also death as well as disruption to services by triggering alarms and warning systems. Another method is making fines and penalties for littering filters; many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette filters; for example, Washington imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters. The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment in which to discard cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact. Consumption \n\nSmoking has become less popular, but is still a large public health problem globally. In 2017, 5.4 trillion cigarettes were produced globally, and were smoked by almost 1 billion people. Smoking rates have leveled off or declined in most countries, but is increasing in some low- and middle-income countries. The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined. Other regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use. Within countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults. Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs. Other countries have considered similar measures. Lights \n\nSome cigarettes are marketed as \"Lights\", \"Milds\", or \"Low-tar.\" These cigarettes were historically marketed as being less harmful, but there is no research showing that they are any less harmful. The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter. In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the tobacco smoke with clean air. In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations. In ultralight cigarettes, the filter's perforations are larger. Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands. Research shows that smoking \"light\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes is just as harmful as smoking other cigarettes. The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In 2019, the FDA authorized the selling of low-nicotine cigarettes in hopes of lowering the number of people addicted to nicotine.

The cigarette is ignited at one end, causing it to smolder; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end. Manufacturers have described the cigarette as \"a drug administration system for the delivery of nicotine in acceptable and attractive form.\" The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but the word is sometimes used to refer to other substances, such as a cannabis (Jazz) cigarette or an herbal cigarette. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is typically white. Many other terms are used for cigarettes, including cigs, ciggies, smokes, darts, stogs, boges, and tabs. Researchers have identified negative health effects from smoking cigarettes such as  cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and other health problems relating to nearly every organ of the body. Nicotine, the psychoactive drug in tobacco, makes cigarettes highly addictive. Every year, tobacco cigarettes kill more than 8 million people worldwide; with 1.2 million of those being non-smokers dying as the result of exposure to second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes causes many of the same health problems as smoking, including cancer, which has led to legislation and policy that has prohibited smoking in many workplaces and public areas. Cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemical compounds, including arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead, carbon monoxide, acrolein, and other poisonous substances. Most modern cigarettes are filtered, although this does not make the smoke inhaled from them contain fewer carcinogens and harmful chemicals. Cigarette use by pregnant women has also been shown to cause birth defects, including low birth weight, fetal abnormalities, and premature birth. Smoking rates have generally declined in the developed world, but continue to rise in some developing nations. Most nations outright ban commercials on cigarettes and have levied taxes on them to dissuade smokers to continue the habit. The first country to introduce a large scale antismoking campaign was Nazi Germany and despite its minimal success it did create a blueprint for many other nations to follow. In the 21st century, a product called an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette or vape) was developed, in which the substance contained within it (typically a liquid solution containing nicotine) is vaporized by a battery-powered heating element, as opposed to being burned. Such devices are commonly promoted by their manufacturers as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, although there are some health risks associated with their use. Because e-cigarettes are a relatively new product, scientists do not possess data on their possible long-term health effects. As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic, inhaling may have become perceived as more agreeable. The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. In 1975, the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in military rations. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking started to become widely known and text-only health warnings became common on cigarette packets. The United States has not implemented graphical cigarette warning labels, which are considered a more effective method to communicate to the public the dangers of cigarette smoking. Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Romania, Singapore, Egypt, Jordan, Nepal and Turkey, however, have both textual warnings and graphic visual images displaying, among other things, the damaging effects tobacco use has on the human body. Since 1950, the average nicotine and tar content of cigarettes has steadily fallen. A key ingredient that makes cigarettes more addictive is the inclusion of reconstituted tobacco, which has additives to make nicotine more volatile as the cigarette burns. The papers used in tipping the cigarette (forming the mouthpiece) and surrounding the filter stabilize the mouthpiece from saliva and moderate the burning of the cigarette, as well as the delivery of smoke with the presence of one or two rows of small laser-drilled air holes. To improve the economics of producing cigarettes, these byproducts are processed separately into forms where they can then be added back into the cigarette blend without an apparent or marked change in the cigarette's quality. Most commercially available cigarettes today contain tobacco that is treated with butterfat and sugar to mask the bitter taste of nicotine. Tobacco companies also use tobacco that has been freebased or modified to increase the speed of nicotine delivery. According to data from the World Health Organization, the amount of tobacco per 1000 cigarettes fell from  in 1960 to  in 1999, largely as a result of reconstituting tobacco, fluffing, and additives. Additives \n\nVarious additives are combined into the shredded tobacco product mixtures, with humectants such as propylene glycol or glycerol, as well as flavoring products and enhancers such as cocoa solids, licorice, tobacco extracts, and various sugars, which are known collectively as \"casings\". A perfume-like flavor/fragrance, called the \"topping\" or \"toppings\", which is most often formulated by flavor companies, is then blended into the tobacco mixture to improve the consistency in flavor and taste of the cigarettes associated with a certain brand name. A list of 599 cigarette additives, created by five major American cigarette companies, was approved by the Department of Health and Human Services in April 1994. This process, known as freebasing, could potentially increase the effect of nicotine on the smoker, but experimental data suggests that absorption is, in practice, unaffected. They have an appearance similar to a finished cigarette, but are without any tobacco or smoking material inside. Filling a cigarette tube is usually done with a cigarette injector (also known as a shooter). Cigarette filter \nA cigarette filter or filter tip is a component of a cigarette. Most factory-made cigarettes are equipped with a filter; those who roll their own can buy them separately. Filters can reduce some substances from smoke but do not make cigarettes any safer to smoke. Cigarette butts accumulate outside buildings, on parking lots, and streets where they can be transported through storm drains to streams, rivers, and beaches. Electronic cigarette \n\nAn electronic cigarette is a handheld battery-powered vaporizer that simulates smoking by providing some of the behavioral aspects of smoking, including the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, but without combusting tobacco. Using an e-cigarette is known as \"vaping\" and the user is referred to as a \"vaper.\" Instead of cigarette smoke, the user inhales an aerosol, commonly called vapor. E-cigarettes typically have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid. E-cigarettes are automatically activated by taking a puff; others turn on manually by pressing a button. Some e-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations. E-liquids usually contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavorings, additives, and differing amounts of contaminants. E-liquids are also sold without propylene glycol, nicotine, or flavors. The benefits and the health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain. Their part in tobacco harm reduction is unclear, while another review found they appear to have the potential to lower tobacco-related death and disease. Regulated US Food and Drug Administration nicotine replacement products may be safer than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are generally seen as safer than combusted tobacco products. It is estimated their safety risk to users is similar to that of smokeless tobacco. The long-term effects of e-cigarette use are unknown. In 2019 and 2020, an outbreak of severe lung illness throughout the US was linked to the use of vaping products\n\nE-cigarettes create vapor made of fine and ultrafine particles of particulate matter, which have been found to contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, flavors, small amounts of toxicants, carcinogens, and heavy metals, as well as metal nanoparticles, and other substances. E-cigarette vapor potentially contains harmful chemicals not found in tobacco smoke. E-cigarette vapor contains fewer toxic chemicals, and lower concentrations of potential toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke. People keep smoking because the nicotine, the primary psychoactive chemical in cigarettes, is highly addictive. Cigarettes, like narcotics, have been described as \"strategically addictive,\" with the addictive properties being a core component of the business strategy. Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). On average, each cigarette smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes. The World Health Organization  estimates that tobacco kills 8 million people each year as of 2019 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. \"Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease\", it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as nonsmokers to survive to the age of 80. Gateway theory \nA very strong argument can be made about the association between adolescent exposure to nicotine by smoking conventional cigarettes and the subsequent onset of using other dependence-producing substances. Strong, temporal, and dose-dependent associations have been reported, and a plausible biological mechanism (via rodent and human modeling) suggests that long-term changes in the neural reward system take place as a result of adolescent smoking. Adolescent smokers of conventional cigarettes have disproportionately high rates of comorbid substance use, and longitudinal studies have suggested that early adolescent smoking may be a starting point or \"gateway\" for substance use later in life, with this effect more likely for persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, behavioral studies in adolescent and young adult smokers have revealed an increased propensity for risk-taking, both generally and in the presence of peers, and neuroimaging studies have shown altered frontal neural activation during a risk-taking task as compared with nonsmokers. In 2011, Rubinstein and colleagues used neuroimaging to show decreased brain response to a natural reinforcer (pleasurable food cues) in adolescent light smokers (1–5 cigarettes per day), with their results highlighting the possibility of neural alterations consistent with nicotine dependence and altered brain response to reward even in adolescent low-level smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air for hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections, and asthma. Nonsmokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Legislation \n\n Smoking restrictions \n\nMany governments impose restrictions on smoking tobacco, especially in public areas. The primary justification has been the negative health effects of second-hand smoke. Nearly all countries have laws restricting places where people can smoke in public, and over 40 countries have comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in virtually all public venues. Bhutan is currently the only country in the world to completely outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco and tobacco products under the Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted as long as the possessors can prove that they have paid import duties. Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000. In March 2012, Brazil became the world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco including menthols. This regulation applies to domestic and imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers had 18 months to remove the noncompliant cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of noncompliant tobacco. Australia, New Zealand, Poland, and Pakistan have a nationwide ban on the selling of all tobacco products to people under the age of 18. Since 1 October 2007, it has been illegal for retailers to sell tobacco in all forms to people under the age of 18 in three of the UK's four constituent countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland), rising from 16. It is also illegal to sell lighters, rolling papers, and all other tobacco-associated items to people under 18. It is not illegal for people under 18 to buy or smoke tobacco, just as it was not previously for people under 16; it is only illegal for the said retailer to sell the item. In the Republic of Ireland, bans on the sale of the smaller 10-packs and confectionery that resembles tobacco products (candy cigarettes) came into force on May 31, 2007, in a bid to cut underaged smoking. Since January 1, 2007, all cigarette machines in public places in Germany must attempt to verify a customer's age by requiring the insertion of a debit card. Since July 2008, Japan has enforced this age limit at cigarette vending machines through use of the taspo smart card. In other countries, such as Egypt, it is legal to use and purchase tobacco products regardless of age. Some police departments in the United States occasionally send an underaged teenager into a store where cigarettes are sold, and have the teen attempt to purchase cigarettes, with their own or no ID. If the vendor then completes the sale, the store is issued a fine. Similar enforcement practices are regularly performed by Trading Standards officers in the UK, Israel, and  the Republic of Ireland. Taxation \n\nCigarettes are taxed both to reduce use, especially among youth, and to raise revenue. Higher prices for cigarettes discourage smoking. Every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by about 7% and overall cigarette consumption by about 4%. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that globally cigarettes be taxed at a rate of three-quarters of cigarettes sale price as a way of deterring cancer and other negative health outcomes. Cigarette sales are a significant source of tax revenue in many localities. This fact has historically been an impediment for health groups seeking to discourage cigarette smoking, since governments seek to maximize tax revenues. Furthermore, some countries have made cigarettes a state monopoly, which has the same effect on the attitude of government officials outside the health field. In the United States, states are a primary determinant of the total tax rate on cigarettes. Generally, states that rely on tobacco as a significant farm product tend to tax cigarettes at a low rate. As part of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the federal government collects user fees to fund Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory measures over tobacco. Fire-safe cigarette\n\nCigarettes are a frequent source of deadly fires in private homes, which prompted both the European Union and the United States to require cigarettes to be fire-standard compliant. According to Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, reduction of burning agents in cigarettes would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes. Since the 1980s, prominent cigarette manufacturers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds developed fire safe cigarettes, but did not market them. These cigarettes have a reduced idle burning speed which allows them to self-extinguish. The European Union in 2011 banned cigarettes that do not meet a fire-safety standard. According to a study made by the European Union in 16 European countries, 11,000 fires were due to people carelessly handling cigarettes between 2005 and 2007. Cigarette advertising \n\nMany countries have restrictions on cigarette advertising, promotion, sponsorship, and marketing. Warning messages in packages \n\nAs a result of tight advertising and marketing prohibitions, tobacco companies look at the pack differently: they view it as a strong component in displaying brand imagery and a creating significant in-store presence at the point of purchase. Studies also show how companies have manipulated a variety of elements in packs designs to communicate the impression of lower in tar or milder cigarettes, whereas the components were the same. Some countries require cigarette packs to contain warnings about health hazards. The United States was the first, later followed by other countries including Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Pakistan, India, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In response to these regulations, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco Inc., British American Tobacco Plc., and Imperial Tobacco attempted to sue the Australian government. On August 15, 2012, the High Court of Australia dismissed the suit and made Australia the first country to introduce brand-free plain cigarette packaging with health warnings covering 90 and 70% of back and front packaging, respectively. Cigarette filters are the most common form of litter in the world, as approximately 5.6 trillion cigarettes are smoked every year worldwide. Of those, an estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette filters become litter every year.

The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment in which to discard cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact. Consumption \n\nSmoking has become less popular, but is still a large public health problem globally. In 2017, 5.4 trillion cigarettes were produced globally, and were smoked by almost 1 billion people. Smoking rates have leveled off or declined in most countries, but is increasing in some low- and middle-income countries. The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implemented strong tobacco control programs have been offset by the increasing consumption in low income countries, especially China. The Chinese market now consumes more cigarettes than all other low- and middle-income countries combined. Other regions are increasingly playing larger roles in the growing global smoking epidemic. Due to its recent dynamic economic development and continued population growth, Africa presents the greatest risk in terms of future growth in tobacco use. Within countries, patterns of cigarette consumption also can vary widely. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by more than half from 1965 to 2016, falling from 42% to 15.5% of US adults. Australia is cutting their overall smoking consumption faster than most of the developed world, in part due to landmark Plain Packaging Act, which standardized the appearance of cigarette packs. Other countries have considered similar measures. Lights \n\nSome cigarettes are marketed as \"Lights\", \"Milds\", or \"Low-tar.\" These cigarettes were historically marketed as being less harmful, but there is no research showing that they are any less harmful. The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter. In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the tobacco smoke with clean air. In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations.

Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands. Research shows that smoking \"light\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes is just as harmful as smoking other cigarettes. The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In 2019, the FDA authorized the selling of low-nicotine cigarettes in hopes of lowering the number of people addicted to nicotine.

In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with certain genetic anomalies (mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability). Medical uses \n\n, pembrolizumab is used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a first-line treatment for metastatic bladder cancer in patients who cannot receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have high levels of PD-L1, as a second-line treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), after platinum-based chemotherapy,  for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), and recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III melanoma and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. People with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10 as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults in combination with axitinib. In March 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy to treat metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the gastroesophageal junction) carcinoma in people who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Efficacy was evaluated in KEYNOTE-590 (NCT03189719), a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 749 participants with metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma  who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Approval was based on the prespecified interim analysis of the first 264 participants of the ongoing KEYNOTE-811 (NCT03615326) trial, a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial in people with HER2‑positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. In July 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab for high-risk, early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. The FDA also granted regular approval to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy for people with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) as determined by an FDA approved test. Contraindications \nIf a person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, those drugs should be stopped before starting pembrolizumab because they may interfere with pembrolizumab; they may be used after pembrolizumab is started to deal with immune-related adverse effects. Women of child-bearing age should use contraception when taking pembrolizumab; it should not be administered to pregnant women because animal studies have shown that it can reduce tolerance to the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Adverse effects \nPeople have had severe infusion-related reactions to pembrolizumab. Mechanism of action\nPembrolizumab is a therapeutic antibody that binds to and blocks PD-1 located on lymphocytes. Pharmacology \nSince pembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through non-specific catabolism, no metabolic drug interactions are expected and no studies were done on routes of elimination. The systemic clearance [rate] is about 0.2 L/day and the terminal half-life is about 25 days. Chemistry and manufacturing \nPembrolizumab is an immunoglobulin G4, with a variable region against the human PD-1 receptor, a humanized mouse monoclonal [228-L-proline(H10-S>P)]γ4 heavy chain (134-218') disulfide and a humanized mouse monoclonal κ light chain dimer (226-226:229-229)-bisdisulfide. History \nPembrolizumab was invented by scientists Gregory Carven, Hans van Eenennaam and John Dulos at Organon after which they worked with Medical Research Council Technology (which became LifeArc) starting in 2006, to humanize the antibody; Schering-Plough acquired Organon in 2007, and Merck & Co. acquired Schering-Plough two years later. The development program for pembrolizumab was seen as high priority at Organon, but low at Schering and later Merck. In early 2010, Merck terminated development and began preparing to out-license it. Merck at that time had little commitment or expertise in either oncology or immunotherapy, but understood the opportunity and reacted strongly, reactivating the program and filing its IND by the end of 2010. As one example, Martin Huber was one of the few senior people at Merck with strong experience in lung cancer drug development, but had been promoted to senior management and was no longer involved in product development. Scientists at the company argued for developing a companion diagnostic and limiting testing of the drug only to patients with biomarkers showing they were likely to respond, and received agreement from management. Some people, including shareholders and analysts, criticized this decision as it limited the potential market size for the drug, while others argued it increased the chances of proving the drug would work and would make clinical trials faster. (The trials would need fewer patients because of the likelihood of greater effect size.) Moving quickly and reducing the risk of failure was essential for catching up with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which had an approximate five year lead over Merck. In 2013, Merck quietly applied for and won a breakthrough therapy designation for the drug. One of its advantages is that the US FDA holds more frequent meetings with drug developers, reducing the risk of developers making mistakes or misunderstandings arising between regulators' expectations and what the developers want to do. This was Merck's first use of the designation and the reduction in regulatory risk was one of the reasons management was willing to put company resources into development. In 2013, the United States Adopted Name (USAN) name was changed from lambrolizumab to pembrolizumab. It is approved for use following treatment with ipilimumab, or after treatment with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor in advanced melanoma patients who carry a BRAF mutation. By April 2016, Merck applied for approval to market the drug in Japan and signed an agreement with Taiho Pharmaceutical to co-promote it there. In July 2015, pembrolizumab received marketing approval in Europe. In July 2016, the US FDA accepted for priority review an application for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after a platinum-based chemotherapy. Because the clinical trial was fairly small, Merck is obligated to conduct further post-marketing studies to ensure that the results are valid. The FDA granted the application orphan drug designation. In June 2019, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for those with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy, and the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The FDA also expanded the intended use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit to include use as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients with HNSCC for treatment with pembrolizumab as a single agent. The FDA also approved a new use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients for the above indication. In March 2021, the accelerated approval indication in the US for the treatment of people with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was removed. Society and culture\n\nEconomics \nPembrolizumab was priced at $150,000 per year when it launched (late 2014). Research \n\nIn 2015, Merck reported results in 13 cancer types; much attention was given to early results in head and neck cancer. At ASCO, in June 2016, Merck reported that the clinical development program was directed to around 30 cancers and that it was running over 270 clinical trials (around 100 in combination with other treatments) and had four registration-enabling studies in process. A clinical Phase III trial in combination with epacadostat, an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor to treat melanoma was completed in 2019.

Merck at that time had little commitment or expertise in either oncology or immunotherapy, but understood the opportunity and reacted strongly, reactivating the program and filing its IND by the end of 2010. As one example, Martin Huber was one of the few senior people at Merck with strong experience in lung cancer drug development, but had been promoted to senior management and was no longer involved in product development. Scientists at the company argued for developing a companion diagnostic and limiting testing of the drug only to patients with biomarkers showing they were likely to respond, and received agreement from management. Some people, including shareholders and analysts, criticized this decision as it limited the potential market size for the drug, while others argued it increased the chances of proving the drug would work and would make clinical trials faster. (The trials would need fewer patients because of the likelihood of greater effect size.) Moving quickly and reducing the risk of failure was essential for catching up with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which had an approximate five year lead over Merck. In 2013, Merck quietly applied for and won a breakthrough therapy designation for the drug. One of its advantages is that the US FDA holds more frequent meetings with drug developers, reducing the risk of developers making mistakes or misunderstandings arising between regulators' expectations and what the developers want to do. This was Merck's first use of the designation and the reduction in regulatory risk was one of the reasons management was willing to put company resources into development. In 2013, the United States Adopted Name (USAN) name was changed from lambrolizumab to pembrolizumab. It is approved for use following treatment with ipilimumab, or after treatment with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor in advanced melanoma patients who carry a BRAF mutation. By April 2016, Merck applied for approval to market the drug in Japan and signed an agreement with Taiho Pharmaceutical to co-promote it there. In July 2015, pembrolizumab received marketing approval in Europe. In July 2016, the US FDA accepted for priority review an application for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after a platinum-based chemotherapy. Because the clinical trial was fairly small, Merck is obligated to conduct further post-marketing studies to ensure that the results are valid. The FDA granted the application orphan drug designation. In June 2019, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for those with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy, and the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The FDA also expanded the intended use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit to include use as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients with HNSCC for treatment with pembrolizumab as a single agent. The FDA also approved a new use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients for the above indication. In March 2021, the accelerated approval indication in the US for the treatment of people with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was removed. Society and culture\n\nEconomics \nPembrolizumab was priced at $150,000 per year when it launched (late 2014). Research \n\nIn 2015, Merck reported results in 13 cancer types; much attention was given to early results in head and neck cancer. At ASCO, in June 2016, Merck reported that the clinical development program was directed to around 30 cancers and that it was running over 270 clinical trials (around 100 in combination with other treatments) and had four registration-enabling studies in process. A clinical Phase III trial in combination with epacadostat, an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor to treat melanoma was completed in 2019.

        "context": "Pembrolizumab, sold under the brand name Keytruda, is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy that treats melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, stomach cancer, cervical cancer, and certain types of breast cancer. It is given by slow injection into a vein. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with certain genetic anomalies (mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability). Medical uses \n\n, pembrolizumab is used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a first-line treatment for metastatic bladder cancer in patients who cannot receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have high levels of PD-L1, as a second-line treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), after platinum-based chemotherapy,  for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), and recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III melanoma and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. People with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10 as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults in combination with axitinib. In March 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy to treat metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the gastroesophageal junction) carcinoma in people who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Efficacy was evaluated in KEYNOTE-590 (NCT03189719), a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 749 participants with metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma  who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Approval was based on the prespecified interim analysis of the first 264 participants of the ongoing KEYNOTE-811 (NCT03615326) trial, a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial in people with HER2‑positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. In July 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab for high-risk, early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. The FDA also granted regular approval to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy for people with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) as determined by an FDA approved test. Contraindications \nIf a person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, those drugs should be stopped before starting pembrolizumab because they may interfere with pembrolizumab; they may be used after pembrolizumab is started to deal with immune-related adverse effects. Women of child-bearing age should use contraception when taking pembrolizumab; it should not be administered to pregnant women because animal studies have shown that it can reduce tolerance to the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Adverse effects \nPeople have had severe infusion-related reactions to pembrolizumab. Mechanism of action\nPembrolizumab is a therapeutic antibody that binds to and blocks PD-1 located on lymphocytes. Pharmacology \nSince pembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through non-specific catabolism, no metabolic drug interactions are expected and no studies were done on routes of elimination. The systemic clearance [rate] is about 0.2 L/day and the terminal half-life is about 25 days. Chemistry and manufacturing \nPembrolizumab is an immunoglobulin G4, with a variable region against the human PD-1 receptor, a humanized mouse monoclonal [228-L-proline(H10-S>P)]γ4 heavy chain (134-218') disulfide and a humanized mouse monoclonal κ light chain dimer (226-226:229-229)-bisdisulfide.

In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with certain genetic anomalies (mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability). Medical uses \n\n, pembrolizumab is used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a first-line treatment for metastatic bladder cancer in patients who cannot receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have high levels of PD-L1, as a second-line treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), after platinum-based chemotherapy,  for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), and recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage III melanoma and lymph node involvement who have undergone complete resection as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. People with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy as monotherapy. the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10 as monotherapy. the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults in combination with axitinib. In March 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy to treat metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the gastroesophageal junction) carcinoma in people who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Efficacy was evaluated in KEYNOTE-590 (NCT03189719), a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 749 participants with metastatic or locally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma  who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Approval was based on the prespecified interim analysis of the first 264 participants of the ongoing KEYNOTE-811 (NCT03615326) trial, a multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial in people with HER2‑positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. In July 2021, the U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab for high-risk, early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. The FDA also granted regular approval to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy for people with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) as determined by an FDA approved test. Contraindications \nIf a person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, those drugs should be stopped before starting pembrolizumab because they may interfere with pembrolizumab; they may be used after pembrolizumab is started to deal with immune-related adverse effects. Women of child-bearing age should use contraception when taking pembrolizumab; it should not be administered to pregnant women because animal studies have shown that it can reduce tolerance to the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage. Adverse effects \nPeople have had severe infusion-related reactions to pembrolizumab. Mechanism of action\nPembrolizumab is a therapeutic antibody that binds to and blocks PD-1 located on lymphocytes. Pharmacology \nSince pembrolizumab is cleared from the circulation through non-specific catabolism, no metabolic drug interactions are expected and no studies were done on routes of elimination. The systemic clearance [rate] is about 0.2 L/day and the terminal half-life is about 25 days. Chemistry and manufacturing \nPembrolizumab is an immunoglobulin G4, with a variable region against the human PD-1 receptor, a humanized mouse monoclonal [228-L-proline(H10-S>P)]γ4 heavy chain (134-218') disulfide and a humanized mouse monoclonal κ light chain dimer (226-226:229-229)-bisdisulfide. History \nPembrolizumab was invented by scientists Gregory Carven, Hans van Eenennaam and John Dulos at Organon after which they worked with Medical Research Council Technology (which became LifeArc) starting in 2006, to humanize the antibody; Schering-Plough acquired Organon in 2007, and Merck & Co. acquired Schering-Plough two years later. The development program for pembrolizumab was seen as high priority at Organon, but low at Schering and later Merck. In early 2010, Merck terminated development and began preparing to out-license it. Merck at that time had little commitment or expertise in either oncology or immunotherapy, but understood the opportunity and reacted strongly, reactivating the program and filing its IND by the end of 2010. As one example, Martin Huber was one of the few senior people at Merck with strong experience in lung cancer drug development, but had been promoted to senior management and was no longer involved in product development. Scientists at the company argued for developing a companion diagnostic and limiting testing of the drug only to patients with biomarkers showing they were likely to respond, and received agreement from management. Some people, including shareholders and analysts, criticized this decision as it limited the potential market size for the drug, while others argued it increased the chances of proving the drug would work and would make clinical trials faster. (The trials would need fewer patients because of the likelihood of greater effect size.) Moving quickly and reducing the risk of failure was essential for catching up with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which had an approximate five year lead over Merck. In 2013, Merck quietly applied for and won a breakthrough therapy designation for the drug. One of its advantages is that the US FDA holds more frequent meetings with drug developers, reducing the risk of developers making mistakes or misunderstandings arising between regulators' expectations and what the developers want to do. This was Merck's first use of the designation and the reduction in regulatory risk was one of the reasons management was willing to put company resources into development. In 2013, the United States Adopted Name (USAN) name was changed from lambrolizumab to pembrolizumab. It is approved for use following treatment with ipilimumab, or after treatment with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor in advanced melanoma patients who carry a BRAF mutation. By April 2016, Merck applied for approval to market the drug in Japan and signed an agreement with Taiho Pharmaceutical to co-promote it there. In July 2015, pembrolizumab received marketing approval in Europe. In July 2016, the US FDA accepted for priority review an application for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after a platinum-based chemotherapy. Because the clinical trial was fairly small, Merck is obligated to conduct further post-marketing studies to ensure that the results are valid. The FDA granted the application orphan drug designation. In June 2019, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for those with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy, and the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The FDA also expanded the intended use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit to include use as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients with HNSCC for treatment with pembrolizumab as a single agent. The FDA also approved a new use for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit as a companion diagnostic device for selecting patients for the above indication. In March 2021, the accelerated approval indication in the US for the treatment of people with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was removed. Society and culture\n\nEconomics \nPembrolizumab was priced at $150,000 per year when it launched (late 2014). Research \n\nIn 2015, Merck reported results in 13 cancer types; much attention was given to early results in head and neck cancer. At ASCO, in June 2016, Merck reported that the clinical development program was directed to around 30 cancers and that it was running over 270 clinical trials (around 100 in combination with other treatments) and had four registration-enabling studies in process. A clinical Phase III trial in combination with epacadostat, an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor to treat melanoma was completed in 2019.

Experts say getting a flu vaccination is essential to fighting the illness. The flu is hitting younger people harder this season than in years past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. People between the ages of 18 and 64 represent 61 percent of all influenza-related hospitalizations recorded during the current flu season — a significant increase compared with previous years when this age group represented about 35 percent of cases. More flu deaths than usual have also occurred in people under 65. Adults between 25 and 64 account for more than half of flu deaths this season, according to the CDC, compared with less than a quarter last year. “Therefore, it is critical that all pregnant and postpartum women get vaccinated to protect themselves against the flu. “We recommend that everyone, six months of age and older, receive either the influenza shot or the nasal spray vaccine and to practice basic hygiene, such as hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes, to prevent the spread of influenza and other respiratory diseases,” he said. CDC experts estimate only a third of people 18 to 64 had been vaccinated by November. The CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted this year’s flu vaccine reduces the chance of having to go to the doctor for treatment by about 60 percent across all age groups. In past years, the vaccine’s effectiveness has ranged from 30 percent to 65 percent. It’s included in all flu shots and nasal vaccines this year, according to the CDC report. Pregnant women are at particularly high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. The designation addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. Doctors recommend using antivirals within the first two days of experiencing any flu-like symptoms. A study of 345 participants aged 5–49 years who received the live influenza virus vaccine LAIV3, and for whom shedding was assessed by viral culture of nasal swabs (daily for days 1–7 post vaccination, every other day for days9 through 25, and on day 28) indicated that 30 percent had detectable virus in nasal secretions obtained by nasal swabbing. Local medical personnel will follow the recent recommendation handed down by the Centers for Disease Control to avoid using the nasal-spray flu vaccine, also known as FluMist. Dr. Ericka Kalp, director of epidemiology and infection prevention at Summit Health, said the nasal spray is made from a combination of live, weakened flu viruses, and was not particularly effective in recent flu seasons. \"The nasal spray was not very effective during the 2013-14 or 2015-16 flu seasons, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the spray not be used for this flu season,\" Kalp said. \"Summit Health concurs with the CDC’s recommendation that those wishing to be vaccinated against the flu receive the shot.\" The flu is a contagious respiratory illness with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. According to the CDC, that means \"no protective benefit could be measured.\" Other non-CDC studies also supported the conclusion that the nasal spray did not work as well as the inactivated vaccine given through a flu shot, which had a 63 percent effective rate. Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older.

When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only. She supported making birth control available to women over the counter. Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, \n\nAbortion in Wisconsin is legal up to the 22nd week of pregnancy. 53% of adults said in a poll by the Pew Research Center that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is also an anti-abortion community, much of it centered on religious groups. There has been some anti-abortion violence, including a bomb attack against a Planned Parenthood clinic in April 2012. Terminology \n\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"induced abortion\" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons. Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context \nFree birth control correlates to teenage girls having a fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. A 2014 New England Journal of Medicine study found such a link. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states have legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. History\n\nLegislative history \n\nIn 1849, the state legislature passed a law that criminalized abortion, making it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman, no matter the circumstances of her pregnancy. The state was one of 23 states in 2007 to have a detailed abortion-specific informed consent requirement. In 2012, Governor Walker and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Healthy Youth Act, which required schools to provide students scientifically-accurate and age-appropriate information on contraception as one method to help prevent STIs and unplanned births. However, this was replaced with a requirement for abstinence-only education, in which schools are to teach that \"abstinence is the only reliable way to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted infections.\" Specifically, requirements under this law require that students are taught the benefits of and reasons for abstinence, as well as the \"positive connection between marriage and parenting.\" In mid-May 2019, state law banned abortion after week 22. Specifically, the legislature passed a measure requiring abortion physicians to provide information on abortion reversal – a procedure that the scientific community sees as illegitimate and invalid, as it is not based upon medically-sound research. In addition, the legislature passed a bill that would eliminate all government funding for Planned Parenthood, as well as a ban on all abortions based upon the race, sex, or genetic anomaly of the fetus. Evers also vetoed a bill that would sentence doctors to life in prison for failing to provide infants with medical care if they are born alive during a botched abortion attempt. Admitting privileges require physicians providing abortion to obtain the right to admit patients at local hospitals – although federal law dictates that no hospital can deny a patient admittance. The state's primary argument in defense of the admitting privileges requirement centers on women's health. Specifically, if complications arise, this requirement presumes a continuity of care for the patient. The court's ruling, however, determined that the remarkably low rates of complications associated with abortion, and the state's failure to impose similar requirements on physicians providing riskier procedures rendered these claims moot. In 2001, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin did not provide any residence related data regarding abortions performed in the state to the Centers for Disease Control.

The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\n The virus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Phylogenetics and taxonomy\n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families) Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses. A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. 3,422 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus. In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins. Phylogenetic tree\n\nVariants \n\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\n Alpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Virology\n\nStructure\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is  in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 1.0 kg. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion. Genome \nSARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long. Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides, like other coronaviruses. The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS–related coronaviruses. By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2. Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus. Treatment and drug development \nVery few drugs are known to effectively inhibit SARS‑CoV‑2. However, it is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans as of August 2021. COVID Moonshot is an international collaborative open-science project started in March 2020 with the goal of developing an un-patented oral antiviral drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number () of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44. This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015. Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Phylogenetics and taxonomy\n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families) Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses. A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. 3,422 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus. In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins. Phylogenetic tree\n\nVariants \n\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\n Alpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Virology\n\nStructure\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is  in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 1.0 kg. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion. Genome \nSARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long. Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides, like other coronaviruses. The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS–related coronaviruses. By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2. Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus. Treatment and drug development \nVery few drugs are known to effectively inhibit SARS‑CoV‑2. However, it is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans as of August 2021. COVID Moonshot is an international collaborative open-science project started in March 2020 with the goal of developing an un-patented oral antiviral drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number () of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44. This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015. Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

There is also debate about the role of zinc in increasing testosterone levels. It is important to approach the use of these popular supplements with caution and consult with a healthcare professional before starting any testosterone-enhancing regimen. This sounds good in theory, but the research—and my experience with it—hasn't panned out. One Australian study with rugby players found no increase in testosterone with it. ** This is a popular ingredient in testosterone-enhancing supplements, and there's some research to suggest it can increase testosterone by itself or when combined with other supplements, but the research has not been consistent. \"Experts\" claim fenugreek works by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen.

It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, \"sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales.\" ** This amino acid is advertised as being able to promote higher testosterone levels, but based on my experience and a recent study, I'm skeptical. ** This is a popular ingredient in testosterone-enhancing supplements, and there's some research to suggest it can increase testosterone by itself or when combined with other supplements, but the research has not been consistent. \"Experts\" claim fenugreek works by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen.

Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medically reviewed by University of Illinois-Chicago, College of Medicine on September 21, 2016 — Written by Jeannette Belliveau. nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis and given Lyrica. I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gout are two forms of inflammatory arthritis. Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation Yes. Unfortunately, rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes difficult to detect and diagnose because the symptoms vary from person to person and there is no one definitive test for the disease. Nine out of ten or 90% of people with RA test positive for ACPA and the test is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of arthritis. Similar to RF, a patient may test positive for ACPA even before the signs and symptoms of … Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. Lab tests aren’t perfect—you can test … Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the immune system that is designed to protect the body by attacking foreign substances like viruses or bacteria. The normal action of the immune system is affected when the autoimmune disease mistakenly attacks the joints. Medical tests for psoriatic arthritis #5: Rheumatoid factor (RF) Rheumatoid factor is a protein antibody produced by the immune system that attacks healthy tissue. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome have positive RF tests. The higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. These tests are used to detect specific antibodies, genetic and immune factors, and certain markers (substances that may Rheumatoid arthritis The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is usually among the last joints involved. Aug 31, 2009 · This test may be useful for monitoring patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, etc.3 However, this is not diagnostic and may rise in other conditions like infections, malignancy, anaemia and some other diseases. An autoantibody is an antibody that is directed against an organism’s own tissues (like in autoimmune diseases). In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, 4 out of 5 people will have RF detectable in their blood. A blood test that measures citrullinated proteins (CPs) could lead to osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses years before the physical symptoms manifest in patients, according to a recent study. Blood Test Aids Early Detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis A blood test that measures the levels of a certain protein can be used in conjunction with clinical assessments to assist with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is now available in North America. Rheumatoid factor is detected in a simple blood test. Learn more about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by taking the symptoms quiz. This quiz is intended for patients who have been diagnosed with RA. Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests are frequently used to help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also to assess any potential problems with the various drugs that are used to treat RA. All tests DNA Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis. This test cannot be ordered as an individual test but only as a part of the list of diseases included in our Genetic Predisposition Test panel. A blood test is used to detect the presence of rheumatoid factor. The blood test is commonly ordered to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic performance of a point of care test (POCT) for detection of anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with 2 years of disease duration or less. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis involves a series of lab tests and a physical evaluation of symptoms. Testing blood for rheumatoid factor is a common way to help diagnose the disease, however some patients may test negative while arthritic symptoms persist. This support surprisingly comes from a study showing that antibiotics were not helpful for treating symptoms of the more common “wear and tear” arthritis (called osteoarthritis)1. Elevated levels can indicate muscle inflammation and other muscle problems. A combination of drugs is the cornerstone of treatment. Blood test that could predict arthritis risk. Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test : Principle, Procedure, Interpretation and Clinical Significance. The IsolateFibromyalgia test reportedly provides a highly accurate diagnosis that differentiates fibromyalgia from conditions that it mimics or conditions that would be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme disease, and lupus. Approximately 88% of people with Ankylosing Spokdylitis test positive for HLA B27. It is important to note that positive HLA B27 results by themselves should not be considered definitive. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate)—This blood test is used to detect inflammation in the body. Higher sed rates indicate the presence of inflammation and are typical of many forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and many of the connective tissue diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the synovium. This leads to an inflammatory immune response that causes pain, joint deformity and disability as it progresses (). Test limitations: Eight percent of Caucasians have a positive HLA-B27, while far less than one percent actually develop arthritis. Can a dexa scan detect arthritis . Suggest treatment for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . In order to facilitate the detection of ACPA in clinical practice, our scientists here at ORGENTEC Diagnostika have used mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) to develop a very effective rapid test for point of care testing (POCT) upon suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis. Sensitive Test Enables Early Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It an effective tool for the rapid and precise routine diagnosis of suspected RA and the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis and the Lung. Authored by Dr Colin Tidy, It is usually associated with severe arthritis and high serum levels of rheumatoid factor. Blood tests for evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, including serology. Respiratory function tests, including spirometry. Your doctor will perform physical examination, evaluate your medical history, order some blood tests (i.e. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, rheumatoid factor or RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-CCP antibodies) in order to confirm the diagnosis. A test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP), substances made in the blood of children with some forms of JIA. Ancillary tests to detect rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A special blood test can help identify the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Other tests (blood tests, MRI or CT scans) may be performed if there are red flags, or to confirm or exclude the presence other rare conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a spinal tumor, infection, fracture, or other types of arthritis. The cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disease (an illness that occurs when the body mistakenly detects its own tissue as foreign and attacks itself). A reliable new blood test can test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) years in advance. With about 1.5 million Americans suffering from the debilitating condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), early detection is key. HealthTap: Doctor answers on Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and More: Dr. Singh on signs of autoimmune diseases with negative blood tests: Routine blood tests do not examine for HIV and may not detect any abnormality due to HIV at two years after exposure. “We have developed a test for measuring the underlying autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis patients that should be used to evaluate new treatment regimens,” says senior author Dr. Gregg Silverman, professor in the Departments of Medicine and Pathology at NYU Langone and co-director of its Musculoskeletal Center of Excellence. Blood Test. A special kind of blood test known as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is carried out to diagnose sarcoid arthritis.. of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Researchers in Sweden found that so-called \"biologic\" drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or anti-TNFs, slightly reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome -- a condition that includes angina and heart attack in which blood supply to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. In another study, British scientists also found taking these drugs was associated with a lower risk for heart attack in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. The roughly 1.3 million Americans affected by the rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack the joints, often suffer from pain, stiffness, swelling, and have trouble moving and using many of their joints. \"It has been known that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a greater risk of developing heart disease than those without,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. \"This risk seems to extend in many forms of cardiovascular disorders, among which the most notable is coronary artery disease, but also includes heart failure, peripheral artery disease and possibly stroke.\" In the first study, the Swedish team compared rates of heart disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking anti-TNFs with patients not using the drugs and people in the general population, to see if the medications could also cut the risk for heart issues. The study involved a group of more than 7,700 patients in Sweden with rheumatoid arthritis who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. The study revealed the prevalence of heart events was slightly lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were actively taking anti-TNFs than people with rheumatoid arthritis who had never taken this type of medication. After taking other factors into account, such as how long the patients had rheumatoid arthritis, other diseases affecting the patients and socio-economic status, the researchers found that patients actively on the drugs had a 27 percent lower risk for angina/heart attack than patients who had never taken such a drug. \"This nationwide study adds to the evidence that use of TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis also has an impact on cardiovascular [illness],\" study author Dr. Lotta Ljung, a senior consultant in rheumatology at Umea University Hospital, said in a news release issued by the meeting organizers. A second study conducted by researchers in the UK examined the effects of anti-TNF drugs on patients' risk for heart attacks. They also considered whether the severity of heart attacks was in any way affected by treatment with TNF inhibitors. One examined the safety of biologic drugs, the other examined heart attack-related hospitalizations in England and Wales. \"Better control of inflammation with biologic therapy might reduce not only the rate of heart attacks, but potentially also affect the size of [heart attacks],\" reasoned study co-author Dr. William Dixon a rheumatologist with Arthritis Research UK's Epidemiology Unit at the University of Manchester. The study showed that patients taking anti-TNF drugs were at lower risk for heart attack than patients taking traditional DMARDs. However, use of the biologic drugs did not affect the severity of heart attacks, the British team found. His team pointed out, however, that patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally have an increased risk of heart attacks. So, even though anti-TNFs may help curb the risk for heart attacks they do not eliminate it. The U.K. group conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who taking biologic drugs still need to take steps to cut their risk for heart disease. \"Given that these studies demonstrate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis, patients should try to mitigate other known cardiovascular risk factors by not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet and weight,\" said Dr. Diane Horowitz, a rheumatologist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\nFor his part, Ong said it makes \"sense that drugs that reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis could reduce some of the risk of developing heart disease in these same patients.\" The U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides more information on rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In those on flibanserin it rose from 2.8 to 4.5 times a month while women receiving placebo reported also an increase of \"satisfying sexual events\" from 2.7 to 3.7 times a month. Each of the three trials had two co-primary endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and the other for sexual desire. Each of the 3 trials also had a secondary endpoint that measured distress related to sexual desire. All three trials showed that flibanserin produced an increase in the number of SSEs and reduced distress related to sexual desire. The first two trials used an electronic diary to measure sexual desire, and did not find an increase. These two trials also measured sexual desire using the Female Sexual Function index (FSFI) as a secondary endpoint, and an increase was observed using this latter measure. The FSFI was used as the co-primary endpoint for sexual desire in the third trial, and again showed a statistically significant increase. The proposed mechanism of action refers to the Kinsey dual control model of sexual response. Various neurotransmitters, sex steroids, and other hormones have important excitatory or inhibitory effects on the sexual response. Among neurotransmitters, excitatory activity is driven by dopamine and norepinephrine, while inhibitory activity is driven by serotonin. The balance between these systems is of significance for a normal sexual response. By modulating serotonin and dopamine activity in certain parts of the brain, flibanserin may improve the balance between these neurotransmitter systems in the regulation of sexual response. The brand name is Addyi. The Committee acknowledged the validity of hypoactive sexual desire as a diagnosis, but expressed concern with the drug's side effects and insufficient evidence for efficacy, especially the drug's failure to show a statistically significant effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire. Earlier in the week, a FDA staff report also recommended non-approval of the drug. Ahead of the votes, Boehringer Ingelheim had mounted a publicity campaign to promote the controversial disorder of \"hypoactive sexual desire\". The letter cited several concerns, including the failure to demonstrate a statistical effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire and overly restrictive entry criteria for the two Phase 3 trials. On June 4, 2015, the US FDA Advisory Committee, which includes the Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (BRUDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSRM), recommended approval of the drug by 18–6, with the proviso that measures be taken to inform women of the drug's side effects. On August 18, 2015 the FDA approved Addyi (Flibanserin) for the treatment of premenopausal women with low sexual desire that causes personal distress or relationship difficulties. The approval specified that flibanserin should not be used to treat low sexual desire caused by co-existing psychiatric or medical problems; low sexual desire caused by problems in the relationship; or low sexual desire due to medication side effects. Advocacy groups\nEven the Score, a coalition of women's group's brought together by a Sprout consultant, actively campaigned for the approval of flibanserin. The campaign emphasized that several approved treatments for male sexual dysfunction exist, while no such treatment for women was available.

The drug is intended for use by pre-menopausal women diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). It works by boosting dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. While this may seem like good news for women who are experiencing distress or interpersonal difficulties due to low levels of sexual desire, this one-of-a-kind drug comes with significant risks and a black-box safety warning. These side effects can be amplified by alcohol use. Doctors are even warned by the FDA to “assess the likelihood of the patient reliably abstaining from alcohol” before describing the medication. It stands to reason that if health plans cover other so-called lifestyle drugs, such as erectile dysfunction medications, they will likely cover this drug, as well, rather than face potential perceptions of gender bias or discrimination. A foundation called Even the Score exists solely for the purpose of, in its words, “leveling the playing field when it comes to the treatment of women’s sexual dysfunction.” With this kind of attention on the new drug, and any others that may follow, health plans are likely to carefully consider their decisions about coverage.

The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to the Government of North Macedonia, to help fight the pandemic:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. May to August 2020\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 22, the U.S. passed 25million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites.

Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

The company produced over a million surgical masks per day during the height of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and rose to prominence again during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Prestige Ameritech offered to provide masks in January 2020 but was rebuffed by the Trump administration. Executive Vice President Michael Bowen noted that in the event of a \"dire situation\", his company could increase production by 1.7 million N95 masks per week by reactivating four N95 manufacturing lines in \"like-new\" condition at significant cost, but \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ().

There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. May to August 2020\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 22, the U.S. passed 25million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. Hospital care crisis\n\nVaccination campaign\n\nEffectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nTimeline graph of doses administered\n\nBackground to various vaccines\n\nVaccine mandates\n\nBy August 2021, more than 800 colleges and universities, over 200 health care companies and dozens of states, local governments and school districts, had some type of vaccination requirements. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

The company produced over a million surgical masks per day during the height of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and rose to prominence again during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Prestige Ameritech offered to provide masks in January 2020 but was rebuffed by the Trump administration. Executive Vice President Michael Bowen noted that in the event of a \"dire situation\", his company could increase production by 1.7 million N95 masks per week by reactivating four N95 manufacturing lines in \"like-new\" condition at significant cost, but \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases.

This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual's medical record or payment history. Covered entities must disclose PHI to the individual within 30 days upon request. Also, they must disclose PHI when required to do so by law such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies.

For simplicity, the amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 are integrated into this timeline. Provisions by effective date\n\nEffective at enactment, March 23, 2010\n The Food and Drug Administration is now authorized to approve generic versions of biologic drugs and grant biologics manufacturers 12 years of exclusive use before generics can be developed. The Medicaid drug rebate for brand name drugs, paid by drug manufacturers to the states, is increased to 23.1% (except for the rebate for clotting factors and drugs approved exclusively for pediatric use, which increases to 17.1%), and the rebate is extended to Medicaid managed care plans; the Medicaid rebate for non-innovator, multiple source drugs is increased to 13% of average manufacturer price. It will not have the power to mandate or even endorse coverage rules or reimbursement for any particular treatment. The bill prohibits the Institute from developing or employing \"a dollars per quality adjusted life year\" (or any similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. Effective June 21, 2010\n Adults with existing conditions became eligible to join a temporary high-risk pool, which will be superseded by the health care exchange in 2014. The new program sets premiums as if for a standard population and not for a population with a higher health risk. Effective September 23, 2010\n Insurers are prohibited from imposing lifetime dollar limits on essential benefits, like hospital stays, in new policies issued. Insurers' abilities to enforce annual spending caps will be restricted, and completely prohibited by 2014. Insurers are required to reveal details about administrative and executive expenditures. Medicare patients with chronic illnesses must be monitored/evaluated on a 3-month basis for coverage of the medications for treatment of such illnesses. A new website installed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide consumer insurance information for individuals and small businesses in all states. A temporary credit program is established to encourage private investment in new therapies for disease treatment and prevention. If an insurer fails to meet this requirement, there is no penalty, but a rebate must be issued to the policy holder. Flexible spending accounts, Health reimbursement accounts and health savings accounts cannot be used to pay for over-the-counter drugs, purchased without a prescription, except insulin. Effective September 1, 2011\n\n All health insurance companies must inform the public when they want to increase health insurance rates for individual or small group policies by an average of 10% or more. Effective January 1, 2012\n Employers must disclose the value of the benefits they provided beginning in 2012 for each employee's health insurance coverage on the employee's annual Form W-2's. This requirement was originally to be effective January 1, 2011, but was postponed by IRS Notice 2010–69 on October 23, 2010. Lawmakers originally felt these changes would help prevent tax evasion by corporations. However, in April 2011, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 repealing this provision, because it was burdensome to small businesses. Before the ACA, businesses were required to notify the IRS on form 1099 of certain payments to individuals for certain services or property over a reporting threshold of $600. Under the repealed law, reporting of payments to corporations would also be required. The amendments made by Section 9006 of the ACA were designed to apply to payments made by businesses after December 31, 2011, but will no longer apply because of the repeal of the section. Effective August 1, 2012\n All new plans must cover certain preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies without charging a deductible, co-pay or coinsurance. Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. The $280 million in penalties comprises about 0.3 percent of the total amount hospitals are paid by Medicare. In addition, an additional Medicare tax of 3.8% will apply to unearned income, specifically the lesser of net investment income or the amount by which adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for a married couple filing jointly; $125,000 for a married person filing separately.) The threshold for itemizing medical expenses increases from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers under age 65. This tax will also apply to some medical devices, such as examination gloves and catheters, that are used in veterinary medicine. Certain non-exempt, non-grandfathered group health plans established and maintained by non-profit organizations with religious objections to covering contraceptive services may take advantage of a one-year enforcement safe harbor (i.e., until the first plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2013) by timely satisfying certain requirements set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Effective January 1, 2014\n Insurers are prohibited from denying coverage (or charging higher rates) to any individual based on pre-existing medical conditions or gender. Insurers are prohibited from establishing annual spending caps of dollar amounts on essential health benefits. Under the individual mandate provision (sometimes called a \"shared responsibility requirement\" or \"mandatory minimum coverage requirement\"), individuals who are not covered by an acceptable health insurance policy will be charged an annual tax penalty of $95, or up to 1% of income over the filing minimum, whichever is greater; this will rise to a minimum of $695 ($2,085 for families), or 2.5% of income over the filing minimum, by 2016. Exemptions are permitted for religious reasons, members of health care sharing ministries, or for those for whom the least expensive policy would exceed 8% of their income. Also exempted are US citizens who qualify as residents of a foreign country under the IRS foreign earned income exclusion rule. In 2010, the Commissioner speculated that insurance providers would supply a form confirming essential coverage to both individuals and the IRS; individuals would attach this form to their Federal tax return. Those who aren't covered will be assessed the penalty on their Federal tax return. In the wording of the law, a taxpayer who fails to pay the penalty \"shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty\" and cannot have liens or levies placed on their property, but the IRS will be able to withhold future tax refunds from them. Repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017)\n\n In participating states, Medicaid eligibility is expanded; all individuals with income up to 133% of the poverty line qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children. As written, the ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. However, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion without losing pre-existing Medicaid funding from the federal government. For states that do expand Medicaid, the law provides that the federal government will pay for 100% of the expansion for the first three years, then gradually reduce its subsidy to 90% by 2020. The formula was changed in the amendments (HR 4872) passed March 23, 2010, in section 1001. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on May 23, 2012, issued joint final rules regarding implementation of the new state-based health insurance exchanges to cover how the exchanges will determine eligibility for uninsured individuals and employees of small businesses seeking to buy insurance on the exchanges, as well as how the exchanges will handle eligibility determinations for low-income individuals applying for newly expanded Medicaid benefits. Section 2708 to the Public Health Service Act becomes effective, which prohibits patient eligibility waiting periods in excess of 90 days for group health plan coverage. This provision was repealed on April 1, 2014 \n To finance part of the new spending, spending and coverage cuts are made to Medicare Advantage, the growth of Medicare provider payments are slowed (in part through the creation of a new Independent Payment Advisory Board), Medicare and Medicaid drug reimbursement rates are decreased, and other Medicare and Medicaid spending is cut. Members of Congress and their staff are only offered health care plans through the exchanges or plans otherwise established by the bill (instead of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that they currently use). A new excise tax goes into effect that is applicable to pharmaceutical companies and is based on the market share of the company; it is expected to create $2.5 billion in annual revenue. Health insurance companies become subject to a new excise tax based on their market share; the rate gradually rises between 2014 and 2018 and thereafter increases at the rate of inflation. The tax is expected to yield up to $14.3 billion in annual revenue. The qualifying medical expenses deduction for Schedule A tax filings increases from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for taxpayers under age 65. Effective October 1, 2014\n Federal payments to disproportionate share hospitals, which are hospitals that treat large numbers of indigent patients, are reduced. The payments will subsequently be allowed rise based on the percentage of the population that is uninsured in each state. Effective January 1, 2015\n CMS begins using the Medicare fee schedule to give larger payments to physicians who provide high-quality care compared with cost. Effective October 1, 2015\n States are allowed to shift children eligible for care under the Children's Health Insurance Program to health care plans sold on their exchanges, as long as HHS approves. Effective January 1, 2017\n Under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, a state may apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a renewable \"waiver for state innovation\" provided that the state passes legislation implementing an alternative health care plan meeting certain criteria. A state receiving the waiver would be exempt from some of the central requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, the creation by the state of an insurance exchange, and the penalty for certain employers not providing coverage. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Ron Wyden and Scott Brown, and supported by President Obama, proposed making waivers available in 2014 rather than 2017, so that, for example, states that wish to implement an alternative plan need not set up an insurance exchange only to dismantle it a short time later. In September 2011, Montana announced it would also be seeking a waiver to set up its own single-payer system. In September 2015, Hawaii became the first state to formally post a draft of the Section 1332 waiver, which proposed a state-level single-payer healthcare system. The draft requested an allowance to forgo several sections of the Affordable Care Act in conflict with the existing state healthcare system established in 1974, the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act (also known as Prepaid). Prepaid enforces employer mandated health insurance similar to the ACA's provisions, but its regulations are more stringent, creating challenges to their pre-existing infrastructure. The threshold for the itemized medical expense deduction increases from 7.5% to 10% of AGI for all taxpayers. (Delayed until 2019 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017)\n\nEffective January 1, 2018\n A 40% excise tax on high cost (\"Cadillac\") insurance plans is introduced. The tax (as amended by the reconciliation bill) is on insurance premiums in excess of $27,500 (family plans) and $10,200 (individual plans), and it is increased to $30,950 (family) and $11,850 (individual) for retirees and employees in high risk professions. The dollar thresholds are indexed with inflation; employers with higher costs on account of the age or gender demographics of their employees may value their coverage using the age and gender demographics of a national risk pool. (Postponed until January 1, 2020)\n\n All health insurance plans must cover approved preventive care and checkups without co-payment. The increase in the threshold for the itemized medical expense deduction from 7.5% to 10% of AGI (originally scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2017) goes into effect (per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). The repeal of the \"individual mandate\" by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 goes into effect, reducing the tax penalty to zero. By January 26, 2011, HHS said it had granted a total of 733 waivers for 2011, covering 2.1 million people, or about 1% of the privately insured population. Referring to the adjustments as \"a balancing act\", Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, said, \"The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014.\" Delays\nOn July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced on the Treasury Department's website that it would delay the employer mandate for one year, under Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12 until 2015. In the statement, the Administration said that they were delaying implementation in order to meet two goals: \"First, it will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law. House Republicans brought two bills to a vote to draw attention to the issue: The Authority for Mandate Delay Act; and the Fairness for American Families Act, which would apply the same delay to the individual mandate, arguing that the individual mandate should be treated the same way – an action which the Obama Administration opposes. Critics of the House Republicans' comparison of the employer and individual mandate also pointed out that the two provisions are qualitatively different. On 10 February 2014, the Treasury Department issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2016 for employers with 50 to 99 workers.

Insurers' abilities to enforce annual spending caps will be restricted, and completely prohibited by 2014. Insurers are required to reveal details about administrative and executive expenditures. Medicare patients with chronic illnesses must be monitored/evaluated on a 3-month basis for coverage of the medications for treatment of such illnesses. A new website installed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide consumer insurance information for individuals and small businesses in all states. A temporary credit program is established to encourage private investment in new therapies for disease treatment and prevention. If an insurer fails to meet this requirement, there is no penalty, but a rebate must be issued to the policy holder. Flexible spending accounts, Health reimbursement accounts and health savings accounts cannot be used to pay for over-the-counter drugs, purchased without a prescription, except insulin. Effective September 1, 2011\n\n All health insurance companies must inform the public when they want to increase health insurance rates for individual or small group policies by an average of 10% or more. Effective January 1, 2012\n Employers must disclose the value of the benefits they provided beginning in 2012 for each employee's health insurance coverage on the employee's annual Form W-2's. This requirement was originally to be effective January 1, 2011, but was postponed by IRS Notice 2010–69 on October 23, 2010. Lawmakers originally felt these changes would help prevent tax evasion by corporations. However, in April 2011, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 repealing this provision, because it was burdensome to small businesses. Before the ACA, businesses were required to notify the IRS on form 1099 of certain payments to individuals for certain services or property over a reporting threshold of $600. Under the repealed law, reporting of payments to corporations would also be required. The amendments made by Section 9006 of the ACA were designed to apply to payments made by businesses after December 31, 2011, but will no longer apply because of the repeal of the section. Effective August 1, 2012\n All new plans must cover certain preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies without charging a deductible, co-pay or coinsurance. Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. The $280 million in penalties comprises about 0.3 percent of the total amount hospitals are paid by Medicare. In addition, an additional Medicare tax of 3.8% will apply to unearned income, specifically the lesser of net investment income or the amount by which adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for a married couple filing jointly; $125,000 for a married person filing separately.) The threshold for itemizing medical expenses increases from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers under age 65. This tax will also apply to some medical devices, such as examination gloves and catheters, that are used in veterinary medicine. Certain non-exempt, non-grandfathered group health plans established and maintained by non-profit organizations with religious objections to covering contraceptive services may take advantage of a one-year enforcement safe harbor (i.e., until the first plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2013) by timely satisfying certain requirements set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Effective January 1, 2014\n Insurers are prohibited from denying coverage (or charging higher rates) to any individual based on pre-existing medical conditions or gender. Insurers are prohibited from establishing annual spending caps of dollar amounts on essential health benefits. Under the individual mandate provision (sometimes called a \"shared responsibility requirement\" or \"mandatory minimum coverage requirement\"), individuals who are not covered by an acceptable health insurance policy will be charged an annual tax penalty of $95, or up to 1% of income over the filing minimum, whichever is greater; this will rise to a minimum of $695 ($2,085 for families), or 2.5% of income over the filing minimum, by 2016. Exemptions are permitted for religious reasons, members of health care sharing ministries, or for those for whom the least expensive policy would exceed 8% of their income. Also exempted are US citizens who qualify as residents of a foreign country under the IRS foreign earned income exclusion rule. In 2010, the Commissioner speculated that insurance providers would supply a form confirming essential coverage to both individuals and the IRS; individuals would attach this form to their Federal tax return. Those who aren't covered will be assessed the penalty on their Federal tax return. In the wording of the law, a taxpayer who fails to pay the penalty \"shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty\" and cannot have liens or levies placed on their property, but the IRS will be able to withhold future tax refunds from them. Repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017)\n\n In participating states, Medicaid eligibility is expanded; all individuals with income up to 133% of the poverty line qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children. As written, the ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. However, the Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion without losing pre-existing Medicaid funding from the federal government. For states that do expand Medicaid, the law provides that the federal government will pay for 100% of the expansion for the first three years, then gradually reduce its subsidy to 90% by 2020. The formula was changed in the amendments (HR 4872) passed March 23, 2010, in section 1001. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on May 23, 2012, issued joint final rules regarding implementation of the new state-based health insurance exchanges to cover how the exchanges will determine eligibility for uninsured individuals and employees of small businesses seeking to buy insurance on the exchanges, as well as how the exchanges will handle eligibility determinations for low-income individuals applying for newly expanded Medicaid benefits. Section 2708 to the Public Health Service Act becomes effective, which prohibits patient eligibility waiting periods in excess of 90 days for group health plan coverage. This provision was repealed on April 1, 2014 \n To finance part of the new spending, spending and coverage cuts are made to Medicare Advantage, the growth of Medicare provider payments are slowed (in part through the creation of a new Independent Payment Advisory Board), Medicare and Medicaid drug reimbursement rates are decreased, and other Medicare and Medicaid spending is cut. Members of Congress and their staff are only offered health care plans through the exchanges or plans otherwise established by the bill (instead of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that they currently use). A new excise tax goes into effect that is applicable to pharmaceutical companies and is based on the market share of the company; it is expected to create $2.5 billion in annual revenue. Health insurance companies become subject to a new excise tax based on their market share; the rate gradually rises between 2014 and 2018 and thereafter increases at the rate of inflation. The tax is expected to yield up to $14.3 billion in annual revenue. The qualifying medical expenses deduction for Schedule A tax filings increases from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for taxpayers under age 65. Effective October 1, 2014\n Federal payments to disproportionate share hospitals, which are hospitals that treat large numbers of indigent patients, are reduced. The payments will subsequently be allowed rise based on the percentage of the population that is uninsured in each state. Effective January 1, 2015\n CMS begins using the Medicare fee schedule to give larger payments to physicians who provide high-quality care compared with cost. Effective October 1, 2015\n States are allowed to shift children eligible for care under the Children's Health Insurance Program to health care plans sold on their exchanges, as long as HHS approves. Effective January 1, 2017\n Under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, a state may apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a renewable \"waiver for state innovation\" provided that the state passes legislation implementing an alternative health care plan meeting certain criteria. A state receiving the waiver would be exempt from some of the central requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, the creation by the state of an insurance exchange, and the penalty for certain employers not providing coverage. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Ron Wyden and Scott Brown, and supported by President Obama, proposed making waivers available in 2014 rather than 2017, so that, for example, states that wish to implement an alternative plan need not set up an insurance exchange only to dismantle it a short time later. In September 2011, Montana announced it would also be seeking a waiver to set up its own single-payer system. In September 2015, Hawaii became the first state to formally post a draft of the Section 1332 waiver, which proposed a state-level single-payer healthcare system. The draft requested an allowance to forgo several sections of the Affordable Care Act in conflict with the existing state healthcare system established in 1974, the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act (also known as Prepaid). Prepaid enforces employer mandated health insurance similar to the ACA's provisions, but its regulations are more stringent, creating challenges to their pre-existing infrastructure. The threshold for the itemized medical expense deduction increases from 7.5% to 10% of AGI for all taxpayers. (Delayed until 2019 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017)\n\nEffective January 1, 2018\n A 40% excise tax on high cost (\"Cadillac\") insurance plans is introduced. The tax (as amended by the reconciliation bill) is on insurance premiums in excess of $27,500 (family plans) and $10,200 (individual plans), and it is increased to $30,950 (family) and $11,850 (individual) for retirees and employees in high risk professions. The dollar thresholds are indexed with inflation; employers with higher costs on account of the age or gender demographics of their employees may value their coverage using the age and gender demographics of a national risk pool. (Postponed until January 1, 2020)\n\n All health insurance plans must cover approved preventive care and checkups without co-payment. The increase in the threshold for the itemized medical expense deduction from 7.5% to 10% of AGI (originally scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2017) goes into effect (per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). The repeal of the \"individual mandate\" by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 goes into effect, reducing the tax penalty to zero. By January 26, 2011, HHS said it had granted a total of 733 waivers for 2011, covering 2.1 million people, or about 1% of the privately insured population. Referring to the adjustments as \"a balancing act\", Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, said, \"The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014.\" Delays\nOn July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced on the Treasury Department's website that it would delay the employer mandate for one year, under Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12 until 2015. In the statement, the Administration said that they were delaying implementation in order to meet two goals: \"First, it will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law. House Republicans brought two bills to a vote to draw attention to the issue: The Authority for Mandate Delay Act; and the Fairness for American Families Act, which would apply the same delay to the individual mandate, arguing that the individual mandate should be treated the same way – an action which the Obama Administration opposes. Critics of the House Republicans' comparison of the employer and individual mandate also pointed out that the two provisions are qualitatively different. On 10 February 2014, the Treasury Department issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2016 for employers with 50 to 99 workers.

For simplicity, the amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 are integrated into this timeline. Provisions by effective date\n\nEffective at enactment, March 23, 2010\n The Food and Drug Administration is now authorized to approve generic versions of biologic drugs and grant biologics manufacturers 12 years of exclusive use before generics can be developed. The Medicaid drug rebate for brand name drugs, paid by drug manufacturers to the states, is increased to 23.1% (except for the rebate for clotting factors and drugs approved exclusively for pediatric use, which increases to 17.1%), and the rebate is extended to Medicaid managed care plans; the Medicaid rebate for non-innovator, multiple source drugs is increased to 13% of average manufacturer price. It will not have the power to mandate or even endorse coverage rules or reimbursement for any particular treatment. The bill prohibits the Institute from developing or employing \"a dollars per quality adjusted life year\" (or any similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. Effective June 21, 2010\n Adults with existing conditions became eligible to join a temporary high-risk pool, which will be superseded by the health care exchange in 2014.

On March 26, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases. On April 11, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths. The HHS Inspector General released a report in April of its survey of 323 hospitals in late March; reporting severe shortages of test supplies and extended waits for results, widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient \n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Real-time PCR (qPCR) provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR, but not all authors adhere to this. Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%. Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. A non-neutralizing antibody either does not bind to the crucial structures on the virus surface or binds but leaves the virus particle infectious; the antibody may still contribute to the destruction of virus particles or infected cells by the immune system. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection. It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR. Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A two-month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian. Functional Assays\nTollotest is a molecular test that detects the activity of a COVID-19 protease, which is a biomarker for active infection. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Testing protocols\n\nDrive-through testing \nIn drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. Pooled testing \n\nPooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. United States \n\nEconomist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy. Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific. According to Romer, \"Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day.\" Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%. Snapshot mass-testing \nA study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing. Surveillance and screening of populations \n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO recognizes wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". The test kit uses the company's \"toaster-size\" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US. The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less. Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The result is read out by the company's Sofia2 device using immunofluorescence. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. A 2020 study found 79% of positive cases were found when used by laboratory scientists, but only 58% when used by the general public and 40% when used for city-wide screening in Liverpool. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\" Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. On July 16, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US CDC indicated that positive results obtained from RT-PCR tests run at more than 35 cycles were almost always \"just dead nucleotides\". On August 29, 2020, the New York Times reported that, \"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada … most tests set the limit at 40 [cycles], a few at 37” and that the CDC was examining the use of cycle threshold measures “for policy decisions,” On July 21, 2021, the CDC, in their \"Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Pan: Instructions for Use\", indicated tests results should be determined at 40 cycles. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Isothermal nucleic amplification test\n\nOne study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. United Arab Emirates \nIn January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. A UAE-based firm owned by Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Group 42 partnered with the BGI Group to supply the testing kits to Nevada. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Delayed testing\nA shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. See also \n 2002–2004 SARS outbreak\n Coronavirus breathalyzer\n Coronavirus disease 2019\n \n COVID-19 pandemic\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n  – International testing statistics updated twice a week. COVID-19 Testing (at least) – now Free for all? (CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Real-time PCR (qPCR) provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR, but not all authors adhere to this. Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%. Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion.

However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Delayed testing\nA shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill.

COVID-19 Testing (at least) – now Free for all? (CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Real-time PCR (qPCR) provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR, but not all authors adhere to this. Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%. Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. A non-neutralizing antibody either does not bind to the crucial structures on the virus surface or binds but leaves the virus particle infectious; the antibody may still contribute to the destruction of virus particles or infected cells by the immune system. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection. It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR. Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A two-month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian. Functional Assays\nTollotest is a molecular test that detects the activity of a COVID-19 protease, which is a biomarker for active infection. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Testing protocols\n\nDrive-through testing \nIn drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. Pooled testing \n\nPooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. United States \n\nEconomist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy. Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific. According to Romer, \"Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day.\" Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%. Snapshot mass-testing \nA study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing. Surveillance and screening of populations \n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO recognizes wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". The test kit uses the company's \"toaster-size\" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US. The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less. Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The result is read out by the company's Sofia2 device using immunofluorescence. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. A 2020 study found 79% of positive cases were found when used by laboratory scientists, but only 58% when used by the general public and 40% when used for city-wide screening in Liverpool. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\" Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. On July 16, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US CDC indicated that positive results obtained from RT-PCR tests run at more than 35 cycles were almost always \"just dead nucleotides\". On August 29, 2020, the New York Times reported that, \"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada … most tests set the limit at 40 [cycles], a few at 37” and that the CDC was examining the use of cycle threshold measures “for policy decisions,” On July 21, 2021, the CDC, in their \"Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Pan: Instructions for Use\", indicated tests results should be determined at 40 cycles. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Isothermal nucleic amplification test\n\nOne study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. United Arab Emirates \nIn January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. A UAE-based firm owned by Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Group 42 partnered with the BGI Group to supply the testing kits to Nevada.

PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. On July 16, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US CDC indicated that positive results obtained from RT-PCR tests run at more than 35 cycles were almost always \"just dead nucleotides\". On August 29, 2020, the New York Times reported that, \"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada … most tests set the limit at 40 [cycles], a few at 37” and that the CDC was examining the use of cycle threshold measures “for policy decisions,” On July 21, 2021, the CDC, in their \"Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Pan: Instructions for Use\", indicated tests results should be determined at 40 cycles. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Isothermal nucleic amplification test\n\nOne study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. United Arab Emirates \nIn January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. A UAE-based firm owned by Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Group 42 partnered with the BGI Group to supply the testing kits to Nevada. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Delayed testing\nA shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill.

On March 26, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases. On April 11, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths. The HHS Inspector General released a report in April of its survey of 323 hospitals in late March; reporting severe shortages of test supplies and extended waits for results, widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient \n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Real-time PCR (qPCR) provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR, but not all authors adhere to this. Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%. Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. A non-neutralizing antibody either does not bind to the crucial structures on the virus surface or binds but leaves the virus particle infectious; the antibody may still contribute to the destruction of virus particles or infected cells by the immune system. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection. It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR. Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A two-month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian. Functional Assays\nTollotest is a molecular test that detects the activity of a COVID-19 protease, which is a biomarker for active infection. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Testing protocols\n\nDrive-through testing \nIn drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. Pooled testing \n\nPooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. United States \n\nEconomist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy. Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific. According to Romer, \"Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day.\" Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%. Snapshot mass-testing \nA study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing. Surveillance and screening of populations \n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO recognizes wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". The test kit uses the company's \"toaster-size\" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US. The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less. Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The result is read out by the company's Sofia2 device using immunofluorescence. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. A 2020 study found 79% of positive cases were found when used by laboratory scientists, but only 58% when used by the general public and 40% when used for city-wide screening in Liverpool. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\" Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset.

History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Testing protocols\n\nDrive-through testing \nIn drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. Pooled testing \n\nPooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. United States \n\nEconomist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy. Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific. According to Romer, \"Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day.\" Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%. Snapshot mass-testing \nA study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing. Surveillance and screening of populations \n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO recognizes wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". The test kit uses the company's \"toaster-size\" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US. The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less. Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The result is read out by the company's Sofia2 device using immunofluorescence. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. A 2020 study found 79% of positive cases were found when used by laboratory scientists, but only 58% when used by the general public and 40% when used for city-wide screening in Liverpool. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\" Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. On July 16, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US CDC indicated that positive results obtained from RT-PCR tests run at more than 35 cycles were almost always \"just dead nucleotides\". On August 29, 2020, the New York Times reported that, \"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada … most tests set the limit at 40 [cycles], a few at 37” and that the CDC was examining the use of cycle threshold measures “for policy decisions,” On July 21, 2021, the CDC, in their \"Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Pan: Instructions for Use\", indicated tests results should be determined at 40 cycles. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Isothermal nucleic amplification test\n\nOne study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. United Arab Emirates \nIn January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. A UAE-based firm owned by Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Group 42 partnered with the BGI Group to supply the testing kits to Nevada. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Delayed testing\nA shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill.

COVID-19 Testing (at least) – now Free for all? (CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Alternatively, point-of-care testing can be done in physician's offices and parking lots, workplaces, institutional settings or transit hubs. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. Real-time PCR (qPCR) provides advantages including automation, higher-throughput and more reliable instrumentation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose the term RT-qPCR, but not all authors adhere to this. Average sensitivity for rapid molecular tests depend on the brand. For ID NOW, the average sensitivity was 73.0% with an average specificity of 99.7%; for Xpert Xpress the average sensitivity was 100% with an average specificity of 97.2%. Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. A non-neutralizing antibody either does not bind to the crucial structures on the virus surface or binds but leaves the virus particle infectious; the antibody may still contribute to the destruction of virus particles or infected cells by the immune system. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection. It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR. Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A two-month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian. Functional Assays\nTollotest is a molecular test that detects the activity of a COVID-19 protease, which is a biomarker for active infection.

Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. On 15 August 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for a saliva test developed at Yale University that gives results in hours. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to perform the detection: if the CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in point-of-care settings. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be detected before onset of COVID-19 symptoms (as soon as SARS-CoV-2 virus particles) with more rapid test results, but with less sensitivity than PCR tests for the virus. Typical antigen tests are COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, often known as Lateral Flow Tests (LFT). \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. While some scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be useful against COVID-19, others have argued that antigen tests are highly sensitive when viral load is high and people are contagious, making them suitable for public health screening. They can also be used to determine how much antibody is contained in a unit of convalescent plasma, for COVID-19 treatment, or to verify if a given vaccine generates an adequate immune response. Antibody Test Types\n\nRapid diagnostic test (RDT) \nRDTs typically use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed at point of care. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralization assay \nNeutralization assays assess whether sample antibodies prevent viral infection in test cells. The result is luminescent. The radiance is used to calculate the number of antibodies. Neutralizing vis-à-vis binding antibodies\nMost if not all large scale COVID-19 antibody testing looks for binding antibodies only and does not measure the more important neutralizing antibodies (NAb). SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. A non-neutralizing antibody either does not bind to the crucial structures on the virus surface or binds but leaves the virus particle infectious; the antibody may still contribute to the destruction of virus particles or infected cells by the immune system. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. Since most COVID-19 antibody tests return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies, these tests cannot indicate that the subject has generated protective NAbs that protect against re-infection. It is expected that binding antibodies imply the presence of NAbs and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses but this is not established for COVID-19. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. COVID-19 can be identified with higher precision using CT than with RT-PCR. Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 lack specificity. By use of the blood quick scan the CoLab score is calculated with a developed algorithm based on how the coronavirus causes changes in the blood. The software is intended for use in emergency rooms to quickly rule out the presence of the disease in incoming patients. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. A two-month study by the Necker-Cochin hospital Paris in conjunction with the French national veterinary school also found that dogs were more reliable than current lateral flow tests according to the Guardian. Functional Assays\nTollotest is a molecular test that detects the activity of a COVID-19 protease, which is a biomarker for active infection. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Testing protocols\n\nDrive-through testing \nIn drive-through testing, the person undergoing testing remains in a vehicle while a healthcare professional approaches the vehicle and obtains a sample, all while taking appropriate precautions such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. Pooled testing \n\nPooled testing can improve turnaround time, by combining a number of samples to be tested together. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. COVID-19 tends to grow exponentially at the beginning of an outbreak, meaning that the number of required tests initially also grows exponentially. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. United States \n\nEconomist Paul Romer reported that the US has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 million tests per day, which is his estimate of the scale needed to fully remobilize the economy. Romer pointed to single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific. According to Romer, \"Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day.\" Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Romer's simulation indicated that the fraction of the population that is infected at any given time (known as the attack rate) peaks reaches roughly 8% in about thirty days before gradually declining, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with cumulative prevalence remaining below 20%. Snapshot mass-testing \nA study found that, despite possibly suboptimal implementation, the snapshot mass-testing approach conducted by Slovakia by which ~80% of its population was tested for COVID-19 within a weekend at the end of October 2020 was highly efficacious, decreasing observed prevalence by 58% within one week and by 70% compared to a hypothetical scenario of no snapshot mass-testing. Surveillance and screening of populations \n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO recognizes wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. Abbott Laboratories' ID Now nucleic acid test uses isothermal amplification technology. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". The test kit uses the company's \"toaster-size\" ID Now device, which is widely deployed in the US. The device can be used in laboratories or in point of care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less. Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The result is read out by the company's Sofia2 device using immunofluorescence. It can be deployed in laboratories or at point of care and gives results in 15 minutes. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. A 2020 study found 79% of positive cases were found when used by laboratory scientists, but only 58% when used by the general public and 40% when used for city-wide screening in Liverpool. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". The review called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\" Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. For example, suppose incidence is 5%. In this situation retesting those with a positive result increases the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only 4.5% of the second tests would return the incorrect result, on average less than 1 incorrect result. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. A May 2020 review of PCR-RT testing found that the median probability of a false-negative result decreased from 100% on day 1, to 67% on day 4. PCR tests by nasopharyngeal swab have a sensitivity of 73%, but systematic analysis of specificity has not been determined due to the lack of PCR studies with a control group. In one study sensitivity was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six since symptom onset. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. On July 16, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US CDC indicated that positive results obtained from RT-PCR tests run at more than 35 cycles were almost always \"just dead nucleotides\". On August 29, 2020, the New York Times reported that, \"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada … most tests set the limit at 40 [cycles], a few at 37” and that the CDC was examining the use of cycle threshold measures “for policy decisions,” On July 21, 2021, the CDC, in their \"Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Pan: Instructions for Use\", indicated tests results should be determined at 40 cycles. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Isothermal nucleic amplification test\n\nOne study reported that the ID Now COVID-19 test showed sensitivity of 85.2%. Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Only administrative tests were carried out at first, until insurance began covering PCR tests on 6 March. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. The government disclosed personal information to the public via KCDC without patient consent. United Arab Emirates \nIn January 2021, the COVID-19 testing results of the UAE came under scrutiny, as Denmark suspended the Emirati flights for five days. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. They managed to convince the CDC to approve tests at state laboratories and the FDA to approve a test kit. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. A UAE-based firm owned by Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Group 42 partnered with the BGI Group to supply the testing kits to Nevada. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Delayed testing\nA shortage of trained medical laboratory scientists, assay reagents, analyzers, transport medium, and PPE coupled with high demand had limited initially limited the availability of testing and led to significantly increased turnaround times. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill.

Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment option for managing chronic eye inflammation. Clearside Biomedical announced that their proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA) improved vision in patients with macular edema from noninfectious uveitis. pSivida announced in a press release that their injectable corticosteroid insert (Durasert) met its primary efficacy endpoint in a second phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of posterior uveitis. Clearside Biomedical is enrolling participants in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Santen is moving forward with a new drug application for sirolimus intravitreal injection (Opsiria) for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis, despite mixed results from their phase 3 trial, Sakura Study 2. A phase 3 trial shows the investigational drug sarilumab is superior to adalimumab (Humira) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. One-year data from a phase 3 trial for pSivida’s sustained-release corticosteroid implant (Medidur) shows it is highly effective in preventing recurrence of posterior uveitis. The FDA has approved the first non-corticosteroid therapy for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) this week recommended that adalimumab (Humira) be approved for treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. Clearside Biomedical announced that a special formulation of triamcinolone acetonide showed good outcomes in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, helps prevent recurrence of posterior uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, may more effectively reduce recurrence and restore vision compared to standard therapy. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has signed a licensing agreement with EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a potential alternative to eye drops and injections for anterior uveitis. Early clinical trial results show that uveitis patients treated with a single suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide experienced improved vision and no meaningful increase in IOP.

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. Uveitis -- a term used to describe a group of inflammatory diseases inside the eye -- can cause loss of vision and potentially lead to blindness, Jaffe explained. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said. Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": "A drug called Humira (adalimumab) has been found to effectively manage chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis without the significant risk of side effects associated with the current standard treatment of corticosteroids. Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment option for managing chronic eye inflammation. Clearside Biomedical announced that their proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA) improved vision in patients with macular edema from noninfectious uveitis. pSivida announced in a press release that their injectable corticosteroid insert (Durasert) met its primary efficacy endpoint in a second phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of posterior uveitis. Clearside Biomedical is enrolling participants in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Santen is moving forward with a new drug application for sirolimus intravitreal injection (Opsiria) for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis, despite mixed results from their phase 3 trial, Sakura Study 2. A phase 3 trial shows the investigational drug sarilumab is superior to adalimumab (Humira) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. One-year data from a phase 3 trial for pSivida’s sustained-release corticosteroid implant (Medidur) shows it is highly effective in preventing recurrence of posterior uveitis. The FDA has approved the first non-corticosteroid therapy for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) this week recommended that adalimumab (Humira) be approved for treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. Clearside Biomedical announced that a special formulation of triamcinolone acetonide showed good outcomes in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, helps prevent recurrence of posterior uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, may more effectively reduce recurrence and restore vision compared to standard therapy. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has signed a licensing agreement with EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a potential alternative to eye drops and injections for anterior uveitis. Early clinical trial results show that uveitis patients treated with a single suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide experienced improved vision and no meaningful increase in IOP.

Known for his gentle, compassionate demeanor with his blood cancer patients, Maloney draws on his experiences in the clinic as he conducts his research on new treatments. Now the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Endowed Chair for Clinical Research at Fred Hutch, Maloney's work focuses on developing and improving cancer treatments known as immunotherapies, which harness the power of the body's immune system to fight disease. As a doctoral and medical student in the early 1980s, Maloney was part of a Stanford University team that made a landmark discovery. Since his arrival at Fred Hutch in 1994, Maloney has continued to make breakthroughs for patients. Rainer Storb and Brenda Sandmaier, he has helped to develop new and improved procedures for blood stem cell transplants, which can save the lives of patients with a variety of serious blood disorders. Those improvements include the “mini-transplant”, whose reduced intensity has brought the lifesaving power of transplants to older and sicker patients who once were not medically eligible for the procedure. As the first medical director for cellular immunotherapy at Fred Hutch and the Bezos Family Immunotherapy Clinic at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (Fred Hutch’s patient-care arm), Maloney is still focused on making the next big breakthrough: developing personalized therapies in which a patient’s own immune cells are genetically reprogrammed to eliminate their cancer. An experimental therapy that revs up the immune system's cancer-fighting ability may help treat some leukemia patients who face a grim prognosis, a small study suggests. The treatment involves infusions of \"natural killer\" (NK) cells taken from a healthy donor and chemically \"trained\" to go after tumor cells. Researchers found that of nine patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received the therapy, four went into complete remission for as long as six months. The findings are preliminary, and the therapy remains experimental, the researchers pointed out. \"When you see this kind of response in these patients, it's provocative,\" said Dr. Todd Fehniger. But he also urged caution: The early phase trial was designed primarily to test the NK therapy's safety. Larger, longer-term trials are needed to prove that it can be a viable treatment, according to Fehniger. \"This certainly shows there is promise here,\" said Dr. Jae Park, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City. Park, who was not involved in the study, specializes in treating leukemia and researching new treatment options. Still, Park called the early results \"hopeful and encouraging\" in the context of a cancer that remains challenging to treat. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML, but it cures less than 30 percent of patients, according to Fehniger. When people don't respond to chemotherapy, or the cancer comes back, it is sometimes possible to do high-dose chemotherapy that wipes out the bone marrow (which gives rise to blood cells), then perform a bone marrow transplant from a compatible donor. Dr. Craig Devoe, acting chief of medical oncology and hematology at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Lake Success, N.Y., noted that \"AML has been pretty barren of new therapies, so there's a huge unmet need here.\" Devoe, who wasn't involved in the new study, agreed that the NK therapy still has to be proven. Other types of immunotherapy have already been showing promise against various types of cancer, including other forms of adult leukemia. In this case, Fehniger's team tried to enhance the inherent capabilities of natural killer cells, which normally go after tumor cells and infected body cells -- but cannot always win. The researchers started with NK cells donated by patients' close relatives. Those cells were incubated overnight in a mixture of three immune system chemicals; past research had shown that the chemicals -- called interleukins 12, 15 and 18 -- activate NK cells in the body. \"After about two to three weeks, they're eliminated by the patient's immune system,\" he said. Of nine AML patients who were given the therapy and could be followed, four had a complete remission -- meaning there were no signs of the cancer in their bodies -- for up to six months.

Dr. Sue Pedersen is a medical doctor, Specialist in Endocrinology & Metabolism, and Diplomate of the American Board of Obesity Medicine, and has a clinical practice at C-ENDO Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic in Calgary. Dr. Yoni Freedhoff is the Medical Director of the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa and has dedicated his life to treating and managing overweight and obesity. He served as the Inaugural Family Medicine Chair of the Canadian Obesity Network, and is a frequent speaker in Canadian and international press on obesity and nutrition policy. The stigma is worse amongst medical professionals; there is often a perceived association of metabolic syndrome and diabetes with being lazy and not exercising enough. This stigma affects the ability of patients to access care, which leads to worse outcomes. Any chronic disease is challenging for patients. Patients with obesity may get substandard care and may not get screened as frequently. Then, you tack on a disease such as diabetes that can lead to medical issues over time. If that person is not seeking care due to stigma, I think they run additional risks, compared with someone without diabetes with obesity. How would you describe the role of mental health care in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes? Mental health care is something that is lacking, particularly in the obesity realm. Mental health challenges can get in the way of intentional behaviour change, and some physicians don’t respect that. It’s depressing to be stigmatized by your medical care team. How has the Canadian Medical Association’s classification of obesity as a chronic disease influenced action from Health Canada? The Canadian Medical Association does recognize obesity as a chronic disease, but the federal and provincial governments do not. The vast majority of health-care providers agree that it is a chronic condition, yet only half of people with obesity are having that diagnosis actually established by their health-care provider. There isn’t much incentive for physicians to do preventative care and counselling in regard to obesity in their practices. But until it is examined on its own as a medical condition, it is easy for schools to not teach obesity treatment because curriculum time is precious. Obesity and related diseases are the largest cause of death in Canada, but medical students will spend more time on (other) diseases they will never see. People with obesity often report feeling judged and shamed by medical practitioners. We have addressed this with the ACTION Canada Study, which we are currently working on publishing. This becomes an obstacle to accessing evidence-based treatment strategies. That is one of the biggest problems by far that exists – patient stories are heartbreaking and common. What are some ways medical practitioners can reduce prejudice towards people living with obesity? There also can be implicit bias in clinical practice. Clinicians can take care to have chairs or benches without arm rests, blood pressure cuffs in large sizes, scales and exam tables that are large enough to accommodate a person living with obesity. We are now writing the Canadian Obesity Guidelines with Obesity Canada, and they are coming out in 2019 with an extensive update to the 2006 edition. That attitude is not helpful. However, there is quackery in this area as well. Programs are only as good as their providers. Are you a Canadian living with diabetes and obesity?

As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. State and local responses to the pandemic have included mask mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, the country declared a public health emergency. The Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in January. On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. Three days later, the United States Department of State advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In August, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected. September to December 2020\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. In spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than 2million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 19, the U.S. passed 400,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 300,000 deaths. On February 22, the U.S. passed 500,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 400,000 deaths. In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. The country ultimately did not reach that goal, with only 67 percent of the overall adult population having done so by July 4. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. Some states ended their mask mandates shortly after, while others maintained the mandate. The CDC was criticized for the confusion resulting from the announcement, as it did not remove existing state and local mandates. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full. September to November 2021\nOn September 8, the U.S. passed 40million cases. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. December 2021 to January 2022\n\nResponses\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level3, its highest alert. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, the State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6billion will be needed. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. However, Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through July. In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act. Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years earlier. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. Impacts\n\nEconomic\n\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Elections\n\nThe pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. According to a USA Today poll from August 2021, 68% supported a business's right to refuse service to unvaccinated customers, and 62% supported employer's right to mandate vaccinations to its employees. Preparations made after previous outbreaks\n\nThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020. On March 13, Trump designated COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency, as the number of known cases of COVID-19 in the country exceeded 1,500, while known deaths exceeded 40. ABC News described the testing as \"shockingly slow\". When the WHO distributed 1.4 million COVID-19 tests in \n\n at Goldman Sachs argued that the U.S. economy would recover faster than expected as impact on the parts of the economy most susceptible to the recent coronavirus spread weren't being affected as severely. On the flipside, Alejandra Grindal at Ned Davis Research, argued that the economy could get worse if the pandemic worsens prior to the deployment of vaccines in Q2 2021, after which the economy would see \"a pretty sharp recovery not only in U.S. economic activity, but also global economic activity\". Nearly 20 million adults — 9 percent of all adults in the country — reported that their household sometimes or often didn’t \n\n the U.S. chose instead to use its own tests. As a result, fewer than 4,000 tests were done in the U.S. by February 27, with U.S. state laboratories conducting only about 200. A comprehensive New York Times investigation concluded that \"technical flaws, regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels\" contributed to the testing failures. Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. On March 6, 2020, Trump allocated $8.3 billion to fight the outbreak and declared a national emergency on March 13. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. State and local responses to the pandemic have included mask mandates, prohibition and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and school closures. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, the country declared a public health emergency. The Trump administration evacuated American nationals from Wuhan in January. On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. Three days later, the United States Department of State advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. On April 2, at President Trump's direction, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the long-term care facility industry. On April 11, the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached 20,000, surpassing that of Italy. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In August, over 400,000 people attended the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and from there, at least 300 people in more than 20 states were infected. September to December 2020\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. In spite of recommendations by the government not to travel, more than 2million people flew on airlines during the Thanksgiving period. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 19, the U.S. passed 400,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 300,000 deaths. On February 22, the U.S. passed 500,000 deaths, just five weeks after the country passed 400,000 deaths. In the first prime time address of his presidency on March 11, Biden announced his plan to push states to make vaccines available to all adults by May 1, with the aim of making small gatherings possible by July 4. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. The country ultimately did not reach that goal, with only 67 percent of the overall adult population having done so by July 4. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. Some states ended their mask mandates shortly after, while others maintained the mandate. The CDC was criticized for the confusion resulting from the announcement, as it did not remove existing state and local mandates. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full. September to November 2021\nOn September 8, the U.S. passed 40million cases. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. December 2021 to January 2022\n\nResponses\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the CDC updated its China travel recommendations to level3, its highest alert. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On February 7, the State Department said it had facilitated the transportation of nearly eighteen tons of medical supplies to China, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6billion will be needed. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. However, Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 through July. From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act. Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years earlier. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. Impacts\n\nEconomic\n\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Elections\n\nThe pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. According to a USA Today poll from August 2021, 68% supported a business's right to refuse service to unvaccinated customers, and 62% supported employer's right to mandate vaccinations to its employees.

In preparation for large-scale production, Congress set aside more than $3.5billion for this purpose as part of the CARES Act. Polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak. In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%), and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%). A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. In September 2020, Pew Research Center found that the global image of the United States had suffered in many foreign nations. In some nations, the United States' favorability rating had reached a record low since Pew began collecting this data nearly twenty years earlier. Across thirteen different nations, a median of fifteen percent of respondents rated the U.S. response to the pandemic positively. Impacts\n\nEconomic\n\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019. In September, Bain & Company reported on the tumultuous changes in consumer behavior before and during the pandemic. Potentially permanently, they found acceleration towards e-commerce, online primary healthcare, livestreamed gym workouts, and moviegoing via subscription television. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. Elections\n\nThe pandemic prompted calls from voting rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders to expand mail-in voting, while Republican leaders generally opposed the change. President Biden has appealed to public organizations and private companies to require employees to be vaccinated, which companies are now legally allowed to do. Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. According to a USA Today poll from August 2021, 68% supported a business's right to refuse service to unvaccinated customers, and 62% supported employer's right to mandate vaccinations to its employees. Preparations made after previous outbreaks\n\nThe United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.\n\n"

These guidelines apply only to women at average risk of developing breast cancer. The new guidelines demonstrate that if a woman and her physician want to reduce her risk of dying from breast cancer as much as possible, they would choose annual screening mammography beginning at age 40. To maximize the number of lives saved, Moffitt Cancer Center recommends annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 for women at average risk. Consistent with the ACS recommendations, Moffitt supports a woman’s right to choose when to begin screening mammography and the screening interval, provided she is well informed by her doctor about the benefits and drawbacks. It’s important to note that the ACS and USPSTF guidelines apply only to women at average risk. Women with a family history of breast cancer, a personal history of breast cancer or other high-risk breast lesions, certain genetic mutations, or a history of chest radiation are NOT considered average risk. 75 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history. Screening only high-risk women, or using a risk-based approach to decide when to begin or how frequently a woman should undergo screening mammography, will miss many breast cancers. Only 1-2 percent of women recalled from screening mammography have a subsequent needle biopsy. Very few invasive breast cancers are overdiagnosed. The new advice is based on improved scientific evidence about the benefits and harms associated with mammography and is consistent with recommendations by the World Health Organization and other major medical bodies. Their recommendation against routine, suspicion-less mammograms for younger women does not change the advice for screening women at above-average risk for developing breast cancer or for testing women who have a suspicious lump or any other symptoms that might be related to breast cancer. Federal guidelines have recommended against routine screening for women under that age since 2009. The rejection of federal guidelines in west Philadelphia is a response to a long-standing conundrum in cancer care: Race and ethnicity are closely correlated with survival rates, especially with breast cancer. Researchers have not come up with conclusive reasons for this disparate outcome. And that has put a target on the latest recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, whose guidelines for tests such as mammograms determine whether plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges must offer the services free of charge. The USPSTF guideline writers did not find sufficient data to conclude that earlier screenings would reduce delays in treatment or the mortality disparities found in black women. “We just don't have enough information, one way or another, to tell us that,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chairwoman of the USPSTF and a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco. The overall death rate has dropped 36% since 1989, which specialists attribute to an increase in mammography screening over the past three decades. The American Cancer Society estimates that such screenings reduce the risk of death from breast cancer by 20%. Historically, black women have had much lower incidence of developing breast cancer than white women. Those over 45 had the highest prevalence for undergoing mammography compared with other racial groups, according to a 2012 study. Advocates say this justifies expanding the screening guidelines to specifically target this group. It's known that certain populations have higher risk, said Chinwe Onyekere, associate administrator at Lankenau. But those very women may miss the opportunity for early detection because the ages recommended for all women to start checking for the disease are too high, Weiss added. When the task force in 2009 recommended increasing the age for routine breast cancer screening for women at average risk it was immediately controversial. The American College of Radiology is only one of several organizations whose guidelines recommend beginning routine screening at ages earlier than 50. Such debate was the focus of controversy in 2009 when the USPSTF first upped the recommended age to begin routine breast cancer screening. Increasing the number of mammograms in a population inevitably increases the number of false-positive results, which in turn leads to follow-up testing and unnecessary procedures such as a biopsies on people who do not have cancer. “We need to deal with the fact that we don't have data to show that screening saves lives for women under the age of 50,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. Last October, the ACS updated its screening guidelines for the first time in more than a decade. It changed the recommended age for women at average risk for breast cancer to begin routine mammography from 40 to 45. Brawley opposes setting a younger age for black women to begin routine mammography. But many on the front lines of cancer care reject that argument. Brawley said too much attention has been given to screening guidelines and not enough to addressing the disparities between black and white women when it comes to the quality and availability of follow-up care after a breast cancer diagnosis. That concern was raised in a 2012 study on disparities in breast cancer deaths in Chicago. The study suggested that where a mammogram is performed may result in a different outcomes. “A disparity in use of high-quality mammography may be contributing to disparities in breast cancer mortality,” the authors wrote. A common theme stressed in all of the major breast screening guidelines has been for providers to talk with patients about mammography. Such mutations have been associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer can be difficult to treat because common treatments are usually ineffective. But women without genetic mutations can greatly lower their risk by limiting alcohol consumption, not smoking and controlling diet and weight. Weiss worried that delaying the time women get routine screenings might also shorten the amount of time they have to lower their risk. In 2009, the USPSTF updated its advice for screening mammograms. Screening mammograms, or routine mammograms, are X-rays given to apparently healthy women with no symptoms or evidence of breast cancer in the hope of detecting the disease in an early, easily treatable stage. According to Julie Margenthaler, a breast surgeon with the Washington University School of Medicine and Chair of the ASBrS Communication Committee, the controversy appears to be a result of conflicting data from studies, as well as a focus on incidence rates, possibly without placing equal value on the stage of a patient's cancer when first diagnosed.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Medical abortions done at Planned Parenthood run for about $300 to $800, according to its website. “Mandating the FDA-approved regimen, without a scientific basis, does not protect patients from unsafe abortion; it only limits access to safe and effective medical abortion for women desiring a pregnancy termination,” they concluded. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing.\n\n"

In February 2015, the jury awarded him $2.5 million for J&J and Janssen’s negligence. The second Risperdal trial occurred just one month later, and again a jury found J&J and Janssen guilty of illegally marketing Risperdal to children.

In the United States as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. CDC estimated in 2019 that US pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal \n\n per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term.

He attributes this position to the death of two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and in July 2006 voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports embryonic stem cell research. He voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo. Coleman opposes recognition of same-sex marriages by either the federal or state governments. In his 2002 Senate campaign he pledged support for an amendment to the United States Constitution that \n\n Harry Reid was anti-abortion and former President Jimmy Carter has expressed his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro-life, while former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi favor abortion rights. Groups such as Democrats for Life of America represent the anti-abortion faction of the party while groups such as EMILY's List represent the abortion rights faction. A Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were anti-abortion while a 69% majority was in favor of abortion rights. According to the 2020 Democratic Party platform, \"Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\" The state has seen anti-abortion rights violence, including the kidnapping of a doctor in 1982 and the killing of Doctor George Tiller in 2009. Pro-life advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The terms \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light.

In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \"I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life.\" He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, \"a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child\". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \"pro-life, with exceptions\". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”\n\n"

With a larger, more progressive freshman class interested in pushing more environmental, health, and welfare policy issues forward, costs will be a concern. What was its impact on health policy and, more specifically, cancer care? Rising prescription medication costs has been a major focus area for both the Trump administration and the 116th Congress. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again. In this case, nursing is present and accounted for among incoming congressional representatives. A recent editorial report makes the case for its adoption with strong evidence from an economic point of view. On October 25, 2018, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) calling for a demonstration project to more closely align Medicare payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologics with international prices, which an HHS analysis showed to be 1.8 times lower on average than in the United States. The proposal is a follow-up to the president’s prescription drug blueprint and HHS request for information to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Since health care delivery is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries. One policy concern for the Obama administration has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. Parts of this material are based on data obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and under license from IMS AG’S MIDAS™ Database, the IMS Brogan Payer Insight Database, and the IMS Brogan Private Drug Plan Database. However, the statements, findings, conclusions, views and opinions expressed in this report are exclusively those of the PMPRB and are not attributable to CIHI, IMS AG, or IMS Brogan. These targeted analyses are designed to inform policy discussions, aid in evidence-based decision making, and provide Canadians with a more comprehensive view of issues pertaining to pharmaceutical drug pricing and utilization in Canada and internationally. The report explores Canadian markets from the national and public and private payer perspectives, positioning them within an international context. Some of the analyses also include other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The growth in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs nearly doubled from 2010 to 2015. This increase was greater than in all of the PMPRB7 countries except for the US. Canada has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of biologic DMARDs compared to the PMPRB7 countries. The Canadian market for biologic DMARDs is still dominated by the first few higher-cost entrants, despite competition from several subsequent market entrants with lower treatment costs. This price difference translates into $224 million in drug sales or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. While the price of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada is in line with the median OECD level, the uptake in sales has been relatively modest to date. If the use of the biosimilar in Canada had mirrored the median OECD use in 2015 (10.1%), it would have translated into a $41.7 million reduction in drug expenditures. Similarly, if the biosimilar uptake in Canada was in line with that of Norway (the country with the lowest biosimilar price and one of the highest uptakes at 67.8%), the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures, or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada. The amount spent on biologic drugs has markedly increased over the last two decades, putting considerable pressure on Canadian and international drug spending. It explores the cost implications for Canadians based on domestic and international markets and prices, and describes the drug portfolios of the manufacturers operating in this space. Some of the analysis is also extended to include additional countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Measures of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs are calculated for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign price. Bilateral price ratios compare the price levels for an individual country to prices available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides a detailed description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Canadian and international measures of per capita drug consumption are also reported. This database contains information on Canadian and international drug sales, list prices and utilization. Canadian and international sales and pricing information are based on manufacturer ex-factory prices. This database houses pan-Canadian information on public drug programs, including anonymous claims-level data collected from the plans participating in the NPDUIS initiative: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Health Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) drug plan. This database houses anonymous claims-level data collected from a large sample of Canadian pay-direct private drug plans, capturing an estimated 85.7% of the national private payer market. This database reports on Canadian national and provincial drug sales at the pharmacy level, and provides information on the number of physical quantities, prescriptions and drug cost. Other data sources include Health Canada’s Drug Product Database, the European Medicines Agency’s orphan drug database, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Drug Review (CDR) reports, and the United Nations’ world population statistics. Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on manufacturer list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The list prices reported here may vary depending on the differences between the procurement processes in the retail and hospital sectors; procuring drugs through the hospital sector generally results in lower prices and greater efficiency. The totals for the Canadian public drug plans analyzed are heavily skewed by Ontario due to its size. Table 1.2 reports on the recommendations, assessments and reimbursement decisions for biologic DMARDs in Canada, which appear to be fairly uniform across the drugs. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluated all but two of the drugs (Enbrel and Kineret), and issued the same recommendation to Canada’s public drug plans: list with criteria or conditions. As of June 30, 2016, the pCPA was in ongoing negotiations for Simponi and Humira for ulcerative colitis (UC), while negotiations for Humira and Actemra for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) were being considered separately by each province/territory. Biosimilars for infliximab are available in several countries including Canada; a biosimilar for Enbrel (Benpali) recently received approval in the European Union (EU); and a biosimilar for Humira (ABP 501) is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration. ‡Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluation: LWCC, list with criteria or conditions. **pCPA, pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance. Compared to international markets, biologic DMARDs in Canada have one of the highest rates of growth in sales and have captured one of the highest market shares. Canada also has a relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs. While biologic DMARDs are a growing market segment in all of the countries included in this analysis, Canada has one of the highest rates of growth in sales. Over the last six years, sales in Canada have nearly doubled, from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $2.2 billion in 2015 (Figure 2.1), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. Over the last decade, the cumulative sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada reached $12.7B, accounting for 5.2% of the total $246.2B in sales in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada. Canada had a compound annual growth rate of 14.6%. In terms of utilization, Canada’s share of the international market for biologic DMARDs has also increased over time. In 2015, the Canadian market accounted for 6.3% of the total physical units of biologic DMARDs sold in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada, increasing from 4.9% over a six-year period. To examine the use of biologic DMARDs in more depth, an analysis of the foreign-to-Canadian per capita drug consumption is reported in Figure 2.3. Consumption rates are determined by converting the quantity of drugs sold in a country into annual treatment doses per patient reported on a per million inhabitant basis. The results are presented as an index, with the consumption rate in Canada set equal to one, and the rates in other countries determined relative to this measure. This bar graph compares the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian per capita consumption of biologic DMARDs for the PMPRB7 countries. The results are presented as an index with the Canadian rate of consumption set to a value of one. Each country is represented by a separate bar: France: 0.68 (32% less than Canada); Germany: 0.58 (42% less); Italy: 0.45 (55% less); Sweden: 1.03 (3% more); Switzerland: 0.83 (17% less); United Kingdom: 0.63 (37% less); United States: 1.00 (same as Canada). While Canada’s per capita rate of consumption of biologic DMARD treatments was comparable to that of Sweden and the United States, the rates were much lower in the remaining five PMPRB7 countries, ranging from 17% lower in Switzerland to 55% lower in Italy. The variation among countries may be due to differences in the demographic and disease profiles of the populations, but may also reflect the uptake of biologic DMARDs, as opposed to other treatment options, as well as the affordability of these higher-cost drugs. Canada’s relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs increases the impact of foreign-to-Canadian price differentials and the availability of biosimilars in the Canadian market. Canada has the highest cost concentration of biologic DMARDs amongst the PMPRB7 countries, with three of the top-selling drugs in this class accounting for 79.5% of the Canadian sales. Although most countries mainly dispense these drugs through the retail sector, Canada’s retail market share is particularly high (90% of the sales). While infusion drugs are generally provided through the hospital sector in most of the foreign markets, they are mainly dispensed through the retail sector in CanadaFootnote 3 and Germany (97% and 68% of Remicade infusions, respectively). This series of graphs illustrates the trends in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs, by drug product from 2010 to 2015. In 2014, 42.0% of all prescribed drug spending in Canada was covered by public drug plans, with the remainder financed by private plans (35.8%) and out-of-pocket payers (22.2%)Footnote 4. Provinces with income-based public plans (British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) have the largest public share of retail costs. As a result, the public share may be overestimated. Source: Payer Insight Database, January–December 2015, IMS Brogan. These drugs account for a smaller share of the private drug plan market (5.6% in 2015), although this share has also been increasing in recent years (from 3.6% in 2010). *Includes the drug cost in public drug plans and the drug cost and markup in private plans. Dispensing costs are excluded for both public and private drug plans.

Private drug plan data: IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database, 2010 to 2015. This is due to Rituxan, whose use as a cancer treatment is captured in hospital sales. The top area graph shows growth in drug costs in public drug plans (compound annual growth rate of 19.3%) as an index, with 2010 set to a value of one. The bottom area graph shows growth in drug costs in private drug plans (compound annual growth rate of 13.9%) as an index with 2010 set to a value of one. * Includes the drug cost in public drug plans and the drug cost and markup in private plans. Dispensing costs are excluded for both public and private drug plans. Sources: Public drug plan data: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. NIHB data for 2015 was not available, so the costs were projected based on the 2010–2014 actual costs trends. Private drug plan data: IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database, 2010 to 2015. The only exception is the NIHB public drug plan, in which Remicade and Enbrel each capture 23% of the market. *Includes the drug cost in public drug plans and the drug cost and markup in private plans. Dispensing costs are excluded. Sources: Public drug plans: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. Private drug plans: IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database, 2010 to 2015. Similar findings can be seen in the private drug plan markets, although the costs are often slightly lower than in the public plans. This may be because of dose titration, which in time results in increased costs. While the Canadian prices for most biologic DMARDs are either in line with, or below, international levels, two of the four top-selling products, Remicade and Rituxan, have considerably lower foreign prices. This price difference represents $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. This section reports the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign list prices. Bilateral price ratios compare the list price levels for an individual country to those available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the list prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides an in-depth description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Note that the list prices reported may vary across countries depending on whether the drugs are procured through the retail or hospital sectors. Figure 4.1 reports the bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for each of the PMPRB7 countries at the drug class level in 2015, along with the multilateral median foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and the OECD countries. The results are expressed as an index with the Canadian price for 2015 set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. Similarly, the median OECD-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.78, indicating that the median prices in the OECD markets were, on average, 22% lower than in Canada. The bilateral results show that prices in four European markets are considerably below the Canadian level (France, Italy, Sweden and the UK). This bar graph gives the 2015 bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for each of the PMPRB7 countries, as well as the multilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median prices. Foreign prices are compared to the Canadian price level, which is set to one. France: 0.73; Germany: 1.12; Italy: 0.80; Sweden: 0.89; Switzerland: 1.13; United Kingdom: 0.77; United States: 1.78; PMPRB7 median: 0.89; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median: 0.78. Source: MIDAS™ Database, January–December 2015, IMS AG. These overall results mask important price differences at the drug level. While the Canadian prices of several biologic DMARDs are in line with international price levels, foreign markets have, on average, significantly lower prices for two of the four top-selling products: Remicade and Rituxan. Figure 4.2 reports the differences between foreign and Canadian list prices for the most common strength of each drug. The results are presented in the form of an index, with the Canadian price set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. Similarly, the results indicate that the US price was 11% lower, and the median price in the OECD countries was 35% lower. Thus, all measures of foreign price analyzed indicate that Canada has the highest price for Remicade. This graph gives the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian price ratios by biologic DMARD for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The Canadian price (which is given in the table below the graph) is set to one and the international measures reported relative to this value. Figure 4.3 combines the two elements in a comparison of the average annual treatment costs across countries for 2015. Treatment costs were based on HDAP estimated annual maintenance doses and IMS MIDAS™ international prices for all sizes and strengths of each drug. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median OECD cost and the average US treatment cost are also provided. Nonetheless, foreign markets have even lower prices. This graph gives the 2015 annual treatment costs for biologic DMARDs for Canada, as well as the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development cost and the average United States treatment cost are also provided. Note: All prices are from IMS MIDAS™ data except for Actemra SC, which is based on l'Association québécoise des pharmaciens propriétaires (AQPP) prices. Sources: MIDAS™ Database, January–December 2015, IMS AG. One point clearly emerges: not only is the list price of Remicade in Canada higher than in foreign markets, but the average annual treatment cost in Canada is greater than the median international costs of the alternative treatment options. An analysis of the international rates of consumption of biologic DMARDs suggests that Canada uses more of the higher-cost treatment options. Figure 4.4 compares the foreign and Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs based on the annual maintenance dose determined by the PMPRB HDAP and reported per one million inhabitants per year. Canada also has a markedly higher consumption rate for Enbrel (455) than the PMPRB7 median (356). These three biologic DMARDs have some of the highest treatment costs in CanadaFootnote 7. This graph compares the 2015 Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs to the rates in the PMPRB7 countries. The average Canadian, average United States and median PMPRB7 consumption rates are also given. The 25% price differential between foreign and Canadian list pricesFootnote 8 for Remicade reported in Figure 4.2 translates into $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Using the same comparison, the difference represents $86 million for the public drug plans in 2015 or 1.2% of their overall costs.

Provincial public drug plans: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. A closer look at the recent trends shows a noticeable divergence in price between the Canadian and foreign markets over time. While Canadian prices have been slowly increasing at a rate lower than the rate of inflation, prices in the PMPRB7 countries (except in the US market) have been flat or declining (see Figure 4.5). This has resulted in a growing gap between Canadian and foreign prices. These two graphs give the trends in prices for biologic DMARDs in Canada and the PMPRB7 countries from 2011 to 2015. For example, from 2010 to 2015, the price of biologic DMARDs in Canada increased by 5%. Canada was the only country with a price growth other than the US, which had an unparalleled 65% price increase. By contrast, several countries, including Switzerland, France and Sweden, had marked price reductions over the same time period. Canada accounts for a sizable share of the international sales of biologic DMARDs, making it an important market from the standpoint of the manufacturers operating in this space. For several of these manufacturers, biologic DMARDs account for the bulk of their drug portfolios and represent a key driver of their sales growth in Canada. While Canada accounts for 2.5% of the total OECD pharmaceutical market, it represents an even larger share of the OECD market for biologic DMARDs at 4.0%, with Janssen Inc.’s sales of Remicade in Canada accounting for 8.5% of all OECD sales (see Table 5.1). Biologic DMARDs are the top-selling products for six of the seven manufacturers operating in this space: Janssen Inc.; AbbVie; Amgen Canada Inc.; Hoffmann-La Roche Limited; UCB Canada Inc.; and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Sobi. As Figure 5.1 suggests, biologic DMARDs account for an important share of their Canadian portfolio. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. For instance, several provinces spent around one tenth of their budget on Janssen Inc.’s drugs in 2015 (Figure 5.2). This bar graph gives the share of 2015 Canadian public drug plan costs by the manufacturers of biologic DMARDs. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. While the price of the biosimilar for infliximab in Canada is in line with the median price level for the OECD countries, the uptake in sales has been modest. Although both drugs were approved for sale in Canada, 2015 sales data is only available for Inflectra. By comparison, the median biosimilar uptake in the OECD countries was 10.1% of the infliximab use in 2015, with 12 countries out of 24 having double-digit capture rates (highlighted in Table 6.1). Although this was one of the largest price differences between the biosimilar and the reference product among the OECD countries, the price of the biosimilar in Canada was actually slightly above the OECD median ($515). The large percent difference results from the list price of Remicade in Canada ($987), which was the highest among the markets analyzed. Following the biosimilar entry, the price of Remicade dropped, on average, by 6% in the OECD countries, while in Canada it remained virtually unchanged. Note: OECD countries not reported in the table have no sales information available for 2015. †Estimated based on data from the IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database. ‡No sales for Inflectra were available for Switzerland in 2015. The results are presented as an index, with the Canadian price for Remicade ($987) set to the value of one, and the international prices of this product and associated biosimilars determined relative to this value. While Canada has the highest price for Remicade amongst the OECD countries (with available data), the price of its biosimilar ($525) is generally lower than the available price levels in the PMPRB7 countries, and in line with the median OECD price level of $515 (as reported in Table 6.1). This bar graph illustrates the pricing of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada versus the PMPRB7 and select Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2015. The biosimilar price in Canada is $525. Despite the markedly lower price, the biosimilar market uptake has been modest in its first year of entry in Canada, estimated at 0.2% of the quantity of the molecule reimbursed by Canadian private drug plans in 2015 (Table 6.1). Table 6.2 explores the cost implications of the lower biosimilar capture rates in Canada (0.2%) compared to the median OECD levels (10.1%). The difference in uptake between the OECD median and Canada translates into an estimated $41.7 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 0.2% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Norway, for example, has both the lowest price for the infliximab biosimilars and one of the highest uptakes (67.8%). If the biosimilar uptake in Canada mirrored the uptake in Norway, the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada.

Public drug plan: This is a general term used to describe drug plans that are administered by provincial, territorial or federal governments. Examples include the public drug plans analyzed in this report. Public drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs and prices accepted for reimbursement. Private drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs accepted for reimbursement. How much more or less would Canadians have paid for the generic drugs they purchased in 2015 had they paid prices prevailing in country X? This report presents a variety of average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios, similar to those published in PMPRB’s Annual Report. These ratios are constructed as sales-weighted arithmetic averages of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios obtained at the level of individual drugs. The right-hand side of equation (G4) is the ratio of this hypothetical amount to the amount Canadians actually paid. Note that D > = < 0 as FTC < = > 1. A value of FTC < 1 thus indicates Canadians would have paid less in total for the drugs they purchased in the relevant period had they paid foreign prices instead of Canadian prices, while an FTC > 1 indicates they would have paid more.

With a larger, more progressive freshman class interested in pushing more environmental, health, and welfare policy issues forward, costs will be a concern. What was its impact on health policy and, more specifically, cancer care? Rising prescription medication costs has been a major focus area for both the Trump administration and the 116th Congress. Congress threatened to subpoena the industry if it happened again. In this case, nursing is present and accounted for among incoming congressional representatives. A recent editorial report makes the case for its adoption with strong evidence from an economic point of view. On October 25, 2018, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) calling for a demonstration project to more closely align Medicare payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologics with international prices, which an HHS analysis showed to be 1.8 times lower on average than in the United States. The proposal is a follow-up to the president’s prescription drug blueprint and HHS request for information to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Since health care delivery is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries. One policy concern for the Obama administration has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. Parts of this material are based on data obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and under license from IMS AG’S MIDAS™ Database, the IMS Brogan Payer Insight Database, and the IMS Brogan Private Drug Plan Database. However, the statements, findings, conclusions, views and opinions expressed in this report are exclusively those of the PMPRB and are not attributable to CIHI, IMS AG, or IMS Brogan. These targeted analyses are designed to inform policy discussions, aid in evidence-based decision making, and provide Canadians with a more comprehensive view of issues pertaining to pharmaceutical drug pricing and utilization in Canada and internationally. The report explores Canadian markets from the national and public and private payer perspectives, positioning them within an international context. Some of the analyses also include other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The growth in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs nearly doubled from 2010 to 2015. This increase was greater than in all of the PMPRB7 countries except for the US. Canada has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of biologic DMARDs compared to the PMPRB7 countries. The Canadian market for biologic DMARDs is still dominated by the first few higher-cost entrants, despite competition from several subsequent market entrants with lower treatment costs. This price difference translates into $224 million in drug sales or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. While the price of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada is in line with the median OECD level, the uptake in sales has been relatively modest to date. If the use of the biosimilar in Canada had mirrored the median OECD use in 2015 (10.1%), it would have translated into a $41.7 million reduction in drug expenditures. Similarly, if the biosimilar uptake in Canada was in line with that of Norway (the country with the lowest biosimilar price and one of the highest uptakes at 67.8%), the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures, or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada. The amount spent on biologic drugs has markedly increased over the last two decades, putting considerable pressure on Canadian and international drug spending. It explores the cost implications for Canadians based on domestic and international markets and prices, and describes the drug portfolios of the manufacturers operating in this space.

Compared to international markets, biologic DMARDs in Canada have one of the highest rates of growth in sales and have captured one of the highest market shares. Canada also has a relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs. While biologic DMARDs are a growing market segment in all of the countries included in this analysis, Canada has one of the highest rates of growth in sales. Over the last six years, sales in Canada have nearly doubled, from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $2.2 billion in 2015 (Figure 2.1), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. Over the last decade, the cumulative sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada reached $12.7B, accounting for 5.2% of the total $246.2B in sales in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada. Canada had a compound annual growth rate of 14.6%. In terms of utilization, Canada’s share of the international market for biologic DMARDs has also increased over time. In 2015, the Canadian market accounted for 6.3% of the total physical units of biologic DMARDs sold in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada, increasing from 4.9% over a six-year period. To examine the use of biologic DMARDs in more depth, an analysis of the foreign-to-Canadian per capita drug consumption is reported in Figure 2.3. Consumption rates are determined by converting the quantity of drugs sold in a country into annual treatment doses per patient reported on a per million inhabitant basis. The results are presented as an index, with the consumption rate in Canada set equal to one, and the rates in other countries determined relative to this measure. This bar graph compares the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian per capita consumption of biologic DMARDs for the PMPRB7 countries. The results are presented as an index with the Canadian rate of consumption set to a value of one. Each country is represented by a separate bar: France: 0.68 (32% less than Canada); Germany: 0.58 (42% less); Italy: 0.45 (55% less); Sweden: 1.03 (3% more); Switzerland: 0.83 (17% less); United Kingdom: 0.63 (37% less); United States: 1.00 (same as Canada). While Canada’s per capita rate of consumption of biologic DMARD treatments was comparable to that of Sweden and the United States, the rates were much lower in the remaining five PMPRB7 countries, ranging from 17% lower in Switzerland to 55% lower in Italy. The variation among countries may be due to differences in the demographic and disease profiles of the populations, but may also reflect the uptake of biologic DMARDs, as opposed to other treatment options, as well as the affordability of these higher-cost drugs. Canada’s relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs increases the impact of foreign-to-Canadian price differentials and the availability of biosimilars in the Canadian market. Canada has the highest cost concentration of biologic DMARDs amongst the PMPRB7 countries, with three of the top-selling drugs in this class accounting for 79.5% of the Canadian sales. Although most countries mainly dispense these drugs through the retail sector, Canada’s retail market share is particularly high (90% of the sales). While infusion drugs are generally provided through the hospital sector in most of the foreign markets, they are mainly dispensed through the retail sector in CanadaFootnote 3 and Germany (97% and 68% of Remicade infusions, respectively). This series of graphs illustrates the trends in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs, by drug product from 2010 to 2015. In 2014, 42.0% of all prescribed drug spending in Canada was covered by public drug plans, with the remainder financed by private plans (35.8%) and out-of-pocket payers (22.2%)Footnote 4. Provinces with income-based public plans (British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) have the largest public share of retail costs. As a result, the public share may be overestimated. Source: Payer Insight Database, January–December 2015, IMS Brogan. These drugs account for a smaller share of the private drug plan market (5.6% in 2015), although this share has also been increasing in recent years (from 3.6% in 2010). *Includes the drug cost in public drug plans and the drug cost and markup in private plans.

The top area graph shows growth in drug costs in public drug plans (compound annual growth rate of 19.3%) as an index, with 2010 set to a value of one. The bottom area graph shows growth in drug costs in private drug plans (compound annual growth rate of 13.9%) as an index with 2010 set to a value of one. * Includes the drug cost in public drug plans and the drug cost and markup in private plans.

Similar findings can be seen in the private drug plan markets, although the costs are often slightly lower than in the public plans. This may be because of dose titration, which in time results in increased costs. While the Canadian prices for most biologic DMARDs are either in line with, or below, international levels, two of the four top-selling products, Remicade and Rituxan, have considerably lower foreign prices. This price difference represents $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. This section reports the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign list prices. Bilateral price ratios compare the list price levels for an individual country to those available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the list prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides an in-depth description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Note that the list prices reported may vary across countries depending on whether the drugs are procured through the retail or hospital sectors. Figure 4.1 reports the bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for each of the PMPRB7 countries at the drug class level in 2015, along with the multilateral median foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and the OECD countries. The results are expressed as an index with the Canadian price for 2015 set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. Similarly, the median OECD-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.78, indicating that the median prices in the OECD markets were, on average, 22% lower than in Canada. The bilateral results show that prices in four European markets are considerably below the Canadian level (France, Italy, Sweden and the UK). This bar graph gives the 2015 bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for each of the PMPRB7 countries, as well as the multilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median prices. Foreign prices are compared to the Canadian price level, which is set to one. France: 0.73; Germany: 1.12; Italy: 0.80; Sweden: 0.89; Switzerland: 1.13; United Kingdom: 0.77; United States: 1.78; PMPRB7 median: 0.89; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median: 0.78. Source: MIDAS™ Database, January–December 2015, IMS AG. These overall results mask important price differences at the drug level. While the Canadian prices of several biologic DMARDs are in line with international price levels, foreign markets have, on average, significantly lower prices for two of the four top-selling products: Remicade and Rituxan. Figure 4.2 reports the differences between foreign and Canadian list prices for the most common strength of each drug. The results are presented in the form of an index, with the Canadian price set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. Similarly, the results indicate that the US price was 11% lower, and the median price in the OECD countries was 35% lower. Thus, all measures of foreign price analyzed indicate that Canada has the highest price for Remicade. This graph gives the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian price ratios by biologic DMARD for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The Canadian price (which is given in the table below the graph) is set to one and the international measures reported relative to this value. Figure 4.3 combines the two elements in a comparison of the average annual treatment costs across countries for 2015. Treatment costs were based on HDAP estimated annual maintenance doses and IMS MIDAS™ international prices for all sizes and strengths of each drug. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median OECD cost and the average US treatment cost are also provided. Nonetheless, foreign markets have even lower prices. This graph gives the 2015 annual treatment costs for biologic DMARDs for Canada, as well as the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development cost and the average United States treatment cost are also provided. Note: All prices are from IMS MIDAS™ data except for Actemra SC, which is based on l'Association québécoise des pharmaciens propriétaires (AQPP) prices. Sources: MIDAS™ Database, January–December 2015, IMS AG. One point clearly emerges: not only is the list price of Remicade in Canada higher than in foreign markets, but the average annual treatment cost in Canada is greater than the median international costs of the alternative treatment options. An analysis of the international rates of consumption of biologic DMARDs suggests that Canada uses more of the higher-cost treatment options. Figure 4.4 compares the foreign and Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs based on the annual maintenance dose determined by the PMPRB HDAP and reported per one million inhabitants per year. Canada also has a markedly higher consumption rate for Enbrel (455) than the PMPRB7 median (356). These three biologic DMARDs have some of the highest treatment costs in CanadaFootnote 7. This graph compares the 2015 Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs to the rates in the PMPRB7 countries. The average Canadian, average United States and median PMPRB7 consumption rates are also given. The 25% price differential between foreign and Canadian list pricesFootnote 8 for Remicade reported in Figure 4.2 translates into $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Using the same comparison, the difference represents $86 million for the public drug plans in 2015 or 1.2% of their overall costs.

Provincial public drug plans: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. A closer look at the recent trends shows a noticeable divergence in price between the Canadian and foreign markets over time. While Canadian prices have been slowly increasing at a rate lower than the rate of inflation, prices in the PMPRB7 countries (except in the US market) have been flat or declining (see Figure 4.5). This has resulted in a growing gap between Canadian and foreign prices. These two graphs give the trends in prices for biologic DMARDs in Canada and the PMPRB7 countries from 2011 to 2015. For example, from 2010 to 2015, the price of biologic DMARDs in Canada increased by 5%. Canada was the only country with a price growth other than the US, which had an unparalleled 65% price increase. By contrast, several countries, including Switzerland, France and Sweden, had marked price reductions over the same time period. Canada accounts for a sizable share of the international sales of biologic DMARDs, making it an important market from the standpoint of the manufacturers operating in this space. For several of these manufacturers, biologic DMARDs account for the bulk of their drug portfolios and represent a key driver of their sales growth in Canada. While Canada accounts for 2.5% of the total OECD pharmaceutical market, it represents an even larger share of the OECD market for biologic DMARDs at 4.0%, with Janssen Inc.’s sales of Remicade in Canada accounting for 8.5% of all OECD sales (see Table 5.1). Biologic DMARDs are the top-selling products for six of the seven manufacturers operating in this space: Janssen Inc.; AbbVie; Amgen Canada Inc.; Hoffmann-La Roche Limited; UCB Canada Inc.; and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Sobi. As Figure 5.1 suggests, biologic DMARDs account for an important share of their Canadian portfolio. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. For instance, several provinces spent around one tenth of their budget on Janssen Inc.’s drugs in 2015 (Figure 5.2). This bar graph gives the share of 2015 Canadian public drug plan costs by the manufacturers of biologic DMARDs. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. While the price of the biosimilar for infliximab in Canada is in line with the median price level for the OECD countries, the uptake in sales has been modest. Although both drugs were approved for sale in Canada, 2015 sales data is only available for Inflectra. By comparison, the median biosimilar uptake in the OECD countries was 10.1% of the infliximab use in 2015, with 12 countries out of 24 having double-digit capture rates (highlighted in Table 6.1). Although this was one of the largest price differences between the biosimilar and the reference product among the OECD countries, the price of the biosimilar in Canada was actually slightly above the OECD median ($515). The large percent difference results from the list price of Remicade in Canada ($987), which was the highest among the markets analyzed. Following the biosimilar entry, the price of Remicade dropped, on average, by 6% in the OECD countries, while in Canada it remained virtually unchanged. Note: OECD countries not reported in the table have no sales information available for 2015. †Estimated based on data from the IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database. ‡No sales for Inflectra were available for Switzerland in 2015. The results are presented as an index, with the Canadian price for Remicade ($987) set to the value of one, and the international prices of this product and associated biosimilars determined relative to this value. While Canada has the highest price for Remicade amongst the OECD countries (with available data), the price of its biosimilar ($525) is generally lower than the available price levels in the PMPRB7 countries, and in line with the median OECD price level of $515 (as reported in Table 6.1). This bar graph illustrates the pricing of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada versus the PMPRB7 and select Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2015. The biosimilar price in Canada is $525. Despite the markedly lower price, the biosimilar market uptake has been modest in its first year of entry in Canada, estimated at 0.2% of the quantity of the molecule reimbursed by Canadian private drug plans in 2015 (Table 6.1). Table 6.2 explores the cost implications of the lower biosimilar capture rates in Canada (0.2%) compared to the median OECD levels (10.1%). The difference in uptake between the OECD median and Canada translates into an estimated $41.7 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 0.2% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Norway, for example, has both the lowest price for the infliximab biosimilars and one of the highest uptakes (67.8%). If the biosimilar uptake in Canada mirrored the uptake in Norway, the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada.

Public drug plan: This is a general term used to describe drug plans that are administered by provincial, territorial or federal governments. Examples include the public drug plans analyzed in this report. Public drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs and prices accepted for reimbursement. Private drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs accepted for reimbursement. How much more or less would Canadians have paid for the generic drugs they purchased in 2015 had they paid prices prevailing in country X? This report presents a variety of average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios, similar to those published in PMPRB’s Annual Report. These ratios are constructed as sales-weighted arithmetic averages of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios obtained at the level of individual drugs. The right-hand side of equation (G4) is the ratio of this hypothetical amount to the amount Canadians actually paid. Note that D > = < 0 as FTC < = > 1. A value of FTC < 1 thus indicates Canadians would have paid less in total for the drugs they purchased in the relevant period had they paid foreign prices instead of Canadian prices, while an FTC > 1 indicates they would have paid more.

The battle to eradicate polio from the globe received another serious setback with the rise of number of children stricken with polio in Indonesia. One was confirmed on the island of Sumatra, which until last week was considered polio-free, said Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesman for the World Health Organization's polio eradication program in Geneva. The other cases were all found in the provinces of Banten, West Java and the capital, Jakarta - areas that already are undergoing large-scale immunization campaigns. Dr. Bardan Jung Rana, a WHO medical officer in Indonesia, said the rise was not unexpected. Early May, the World Health Organisation confirmed that an 18-month-old child had been paralysed by polio in a village in west Java, Indonesia. WHO records show that several dozen patients in Indonesia developed polio after being vaccinated against the disease in the late 1990's. Since 2001, Indonesia has recorded no polio infections at all. The virus found in the Indonesian case closely matches samples collected in an outbreak in recent months in Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The WHO says with the Indonesian case, 16 countries have had wild-virus outbreaks since 2003. The polio virus enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with the stool of an infected person. Polio is preventable by immunization. Polio eradication, the permanent global cessation of circulation by the poliovirus and hence elimination of the poliomyelitis (polio) it causes, is the aim of a multinational public health effort begun in 1988, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Rotary Foundation. There are two kinds of polio vaccine—oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses weakened poliovirus, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while the OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immunodeficient. Nigeria is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of wild poliovirus, with its last reported case in 2016. Wild poliovirus has been eradicated in all continents except Asia, and , Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two countries where the disease is still classified as endemic. Type3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio in 2012, and was declared eradicated in 2019. Vaccines against each of the three types have given rise to emergent strains of cVDPV, with cVDPV2 being most prominent, and such strains caused over 1,000 polio cases in 2020. Factors influencing eradication of polio \n\nEradication of polio has been defined in various ways—as elimination of the occurrence of poliomyelitis even in the absence of human intervention, as extinction of poliovirus, such that the infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory, as control of an infection to the point at which transmission of the disease ceased within a specified area, and as reduction of the worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis to zero as a result of deliberate efforts, and requiring no further control measures. Strategy \nThe most important step in eradication of polio is interruption of endemic transmission of poliovirus. Several key strategies have been outlined for stopping polio transmission:\n\n High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life in developing and endemic countries, and routine immunization with OPV and/or IPV elsewhere. Active surveillance for poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis. Expanded environmental surveillance to detect the presence of poliovirus in communities. Since most polio infections are asymptomatic, transmission can occur in spite of the absence of polio-related AFP cases, and such monitoring helps to evaluate the degree to which virus continues to circulate in an area. Targeted \"mop-up\" campaigns once poliovirus transmission is limited to specific geographical foci. The oral polio vaccine (OPV, or Sabin vaccine) contains an attenuated poliovirus, 10,000 times less able to enter the circulation and cause polio, delivered as oral drops or infused into sugar cubes. Because the immune response to oral polio vaccine is very similar to that of natural polio infection, it is expected that oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity to the virus. Until recent times, a trivalent OPV containing all three virus strains was used, but with the eradication of wild poliovirus type2 this was phased out in 2016 and replaced with bivalent vaccine containing just types 1 and 3, while use of monovalent type2 OPV is restricted to regions with documented cVDPV2 circulation. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV, or Salk) contains trivalent fully inactivated virus, administered by injection. As a consequence, vaccinated individuals are protected from contracting polio, but their intestinal mucosa may still be infected and serve as a reservoir for the excretion of live virus. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact, and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. Vaccine-derived poliovirus \n \n\nWhile vaccination has played an instrumental role in the reduction of polio cases worldwide, the use of attenuated virus in the oral vaccine carries with it an inherent risk. As a result of such circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains, polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus, but where vaccination rates have fallen. Stool samples are collected from children presenting with AFP and evaluated for the presence of poliovirus by accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. Since rates of non-polio AFP are expected to be constant and large compared to the number of polio cases, the frequency of non-polio AFP reported in a population is indicative of the effectiveness of surveillance, as is the proportion of AFP patients from whom high-quality stool samples are collected and tested, with a target of at least 80%. An independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the researchers concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity, but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, and inadequately resourced health facilities also posed problems, as did technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine. Two additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most individuals infected with poliovirus are asymptomatic or exhibit minor symptoms, with fewer than 1% of infections leading to paralysis, and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. In 2000, using new screening techniques for the molecular characterization of outbreak viral strains, it was discovered that some of the outbreaks were actually caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine. This discovery altered the strategy for the discontinuation of vaccination following polio eradication, necessitating an eventual switch to the more expensive and logistically more problematic inactivated polio vaccine, as continued use of the oral inactivated virus would continue to produce such revertant infection-causing strains. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, as a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine. He said that the biggest hurdle preventing Pakistan from becoming polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children. and added that, in spite of this, \"the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working.\" Opposition to vaccination efforts\n\nOne factor contributing to the continued circulation of polio immunization programs has been opposition in some countries. Refusal of vaccination came to be viewed as resistance to western expansionism, and when the contamination rumours led the Nigerian Supreme Council for Sharia to call for a region-wide boycott of polio vaccination, polio cases in the country increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2006, with the uncontrolled virus then spreading across Africa and globally. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, fears that the vaccine contained contraceptives were one reason given by the Taliban in issuing fatwas against polio vaccination. Pakistan reported the world's highest number of polio cases (198) in 2011. Polio vaccination efforts have also faced resistance in another form. Some governments have been accused of withholding vaccination or the necessary accompanying infrastructure from regions where opposition to their rule is high. Polio eradication criteria \nA country is regarded as polio free or non-endemic if no cases have been detected for a year. However, it is still possible polio circulates under these circumstances, as was the case for Nigeria, where a particular strain of virus resurfaced after five years in 2016. Moreover, for WPV1—the only type of the virus which is currently circulating following the eradication of WPV2 and WPV3—only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralysis in non-vaccinated children, and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children. Therefore, even a single case is considered an epidemic. In Pakistan in the last couple of years, the number of paralysis cases has dropped relatively faster than the positive environmental samples, which has shown no progress since 2015. For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated worldwide, at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved, though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3, where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms, or if virus-positive environmental samples continue to be reported. Wild poliovirus type2 was certified eradicated in 2015, the last case having been detected in 1999. Timeline\n\nPre-1988 \n\nFollowing the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. 1988–2000 \n\nIn 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO), together with Rotary International, UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) passed the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), with the goal of eradicating polio by the year 2000. The last case of wild poliovirus poliomyelitis in the Americas was reported in Peru, August 1991. In 1994, the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio. In 1998, Melik Minas of Turkey became the last case of polio reported in Europe. In 1997, Mum Chanty of Cambodia became the last person to contract polio in the Indo-West Pacific region. In 2000, the Western Pacific Region (including China) was certified polio-free. In October 1999, the last isolation of type2 poliovirus occurred in India. This type of poliovirus was declared eradicated. The World Health Organization announced that Europe was polio-free on 21 June 2002, in the Copenhagen Glyptotek. In 2002, an outbreak of polio occurred in India. The number of planned polio vaccination campaigns had recently been reduced, and populations in northern India, particularly from the Islamic background, engaged in mass resistance to immunization. At this time, the Indian state Uttar Pradesh accounted for nearly two-thirds of total worldwide cases reported. (See the 2002 Global polio incidence map.) However, by 2004, India had adopted strategies to increase ownership of polio vaccinations in marginalized populations, and the immunity gap in vulnerable groups rapidly closed. On 30 June 2004, the WHO announced that after a 10-month ban on polio vaccinations, Kano had pledged to restart the campaign in early July. During the ban the virus spread across Nigeria and into 12 neighboring countries that had previously been polio-free. In addition to the rumors of sterility and the ban by Nigeria's Kano state, civil war and internal strife in Sudan and Côte d'Ivoire have complicated WHO's polio eradication goal. In 2004, almost two-thirds of all the polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria (760 out of 1,170 total). In May 2004 the first case of the polio outbreak in Sudan was detected. In 2005 there were 1,979 cases of wild poliovirus (excludes vaccine-derived polio viruses). Using the Pulse Polio campaign to increase polio immunization rates, India recorded just 66 cases in 2005, down from 135 cases reported in 2004, 225 in 2003, and 1,600 in 2002. Yemen, Indonesia, and Sudan, countries that had been declared polio-free since before 2000, each reported hundreds of cases—probably imported from Nigeria. On 5 May 2005, news reports broke that a new case of polio was diagnosed in Java, Indonesia, and the virus strain was suspected to be the same as the one that has caused outbreaks in Nigeria. New public fears over vaccine safety, which were unfounded, impeded vaccination efforts in Indonesia. In summer 2005, the WHO, UNICEF and the Indonesian government made new efforts to lay the fears to rest, recruiting celebrities and religious leaders in a publicity campaign to promote vaccination. In the United States on 29 September 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health identified the first occurrence of vaccine derived polio virus (VDPV) transmission in the United States since OPV was discontinued in 2000. The poliovirus type1 infection occurred in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged seven months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were not vaccinated for polio. 2006–2010 \n\nIn 2006, only four countries in the world (Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) were reported to have endemic polio. A total of 1,997 cases worldwide were reported in 2006; of these the majority (1,869 cases) occurred in countries with endemic polio. Nigeria accounted for the majority of cases (1,122 cases) but India reported more than ten times more cases this year than in 2005 (676 cases, or 30% of worldwide cases). Polio re-surfaced in Bangladesh after nearly six years of absence with 18 new cases reported. (See: Map of reported polio cases in 2006)\n\nIn 2007, there were 1,315 cases of poliomyelitis reported worldwide. Over 60% of cases (874) occurred in India; while in Nigeria, the number of polio cases fell dramatically, from 1,122 cases reported in 2006 to 285 cases in 2007. Local governments and clerics allowed vaccinations to resume on the condition that the vaccines be manufactured in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country, and not in the United States. Attending the launch of immunization campaigns in Birnin Kebbi in July 2007, Turai Yar'Adua urged parents to vaccinate their children and stressed the safety of oral polio vaccine. In July 2007, a student traveling from Pakistan imported the first polio case to Australia in over 20 years. Other countries with significant numbers of wild polio virus cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which reported 41 cases, Chad with 22 cases, and Niger and Myanmar, each of which reported 11 cases. According to figures updated in April 2012, the WHO reported that there were 1,352 cases of wild polio in 20 countries in 2010. Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year, with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) and an increase in cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases). Polio transmission recurred in Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kenya reported its first case since 2009, while China reported 21 cases, mostly among the Uyghurs of Hotan prefecture, Xinjiang, the first cases since 1994. Several additional countries, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Yemen, saw outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio. In April, a case of wild polio in Mogadishu was reported, the first in Somalia since 2007. Routine sewage monitoring in 2012 had detected a WPV1 strain of Pakistani origin in Cairo, sparking a major vaccination push there. The strain spread to Israel, where there was widespread environmental detection, but like Egypt, no paralysis cases. The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries, and also dictated a switch to inactivated virus injections, to avoid the risk of the vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus oral vaccine. In 2014, there were 359 reported cases of wild poliomyelitis, spread over twelve countries. On 27 March 2014, the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, in which the WHO includes eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. With the addition of this region, the proportion of world population living in polio-free regions reached 80%. The last case of wild polio in the South-East Asia Region was reported in India on 13 January 2011. During 2015, 74 cases of wild poliomyelitis were reported worldwide, 54 in Pakistan and 20 in Afghanistan. There were 32 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases in 2015. On 25 September 2015, the WHO declared that Nigeria was no longer considered endemic for wild polio virus, with no reported case of wild polio virus having been reported since 24 July 2014. 2016 \n\nThere were 37 reported WPV1 cases with an onset of paralysis in 2016, half as many as in 2015, with the majority of the cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 2017 \n\nThere were 22 reported WPV1 polio cases with onset of paralysis in 2017, down from 37 in 2016. In spite of a significant drop in detected cases in Pakistan, there was an increase in the percentage of environmental samples that test positive for the polio virus, suggesting gaps in identification of infected individuals. In the third country where polio remains endemic, Nigeria, there were no cases, though as few as 7% of infants were fully vaccinated in some districts. Laos was declared free of cVDPV1 in March, but three distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of them of recent origin, the other two having circulated undetected for more than a year. Polio in Pakistan resurged in the latter part of the year. Cases caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus were reported in seven countries, with almost 100 total cases. In Somalia, cVDPV2 continued to circulate, causing several polio cases and detected in environmental samples from as far as Nairobi, Kenya. In Papua New Guinea, a cVDPV1 strain arose, causing twenty-six polio cases across nine provinces, while a single diagnosed cVDPV1 case in neighboring Indonesia, resulted from a distinct outbreak. 2019\n\nThere were 176 WPV1 paralysis cases detected in 2019: 29 in Afghanistan and 147 in Pakistan. In particular, in Pakistan the number of cases was surging. Transborder migration continued to play a role in polio transmission in the two countries. Opponents to vaccination in Pakistan launched a series of attacks in April that left a vaccinator and two security men dead, while false rumors and hoax videos reporting vaccine toxicity also disrupted vaccination efforts there. Wild poliovirus of Pakistani origin also spread to Iran where it was detected in several environmental samples. In the third remaining country in which polio was classified as endemic, Nigeria, wild poliovirus has not been detected since October 2016, and levels of AFP surveillance are sufficient, even in security-compromised regions, to suggest transmission of WPV may have been interrupted. Individual new outbreaks of cVDPV2 also caused more than a dozen paralysis cases each in Pakistan and the Philippines, while smaller outbreaks struck Chad, China and Zambia. cVDPV was also detected in several additional countries with no diagnosed polio case. Pakistan announced the restart of their polio vaccination campaigns in July, after their COVID numbers dropped. In June, Nigeria was removed from the list of countries with endemic wild poliovirus, leaving only Pakistan and Afghanistan. Two months later, the Africa Regional Certification Commission, an independent body appointed by the World Health Organization, declared the African continent free of wild poliovirus. This certification came after extensive assessments of the certifications of National Polio Certification Commissions (NCCs) and confirmation that at least 95% of Africa's population had been immunised. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom called it a \"great day... but not the end of polio,\" as there remain major continuing outbreaks of the vaccine derived poliovirus in West Africa and Ethiopia in addition to wild cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 2021\n\nIn 2021, six cases caused by wild poliovirus were confirmed, one in Pakistan, four in Afghanistan, and one in Malawi, all caused by WPV1. The case in Malawi, the country's first in almost three decades and the first in Africa in five years, was seen as a significant setback to the eradication effort. This was engineered to allow vaccination against strain2 poliovirus without the frequent spawning of cVDPV2 seen with the orignal OPV2. 2022\n\nAs of 22 February, in 2022 one case of WPV1 polio had been recorded, in Afghanistan, with one caused by cVDPV1 in Madagascar and three by cVDPV2, one each in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Somalia. On 27 January 2022 Pakistan marked one year without a detected case of WPV1-caused polio, though the virus continued to appear in environmental samples from the country as recently as the previous month, and polio cases due to cVDPV2 were seen during the period.

The battle to eradicate polio from the globe received another serious setback with the rise of number of children stricken with polio in Indonesia. One was confirmed on the island of Sumatra, which until last week was considered polio-free, said Oliver Rosenbauer, spokesman for the World Health Organization's polio eradication program in Geneva. The other cases were all found in the provinces of Banten, West Java and the capital, Jakarta - areas that already are undergoing large-scale immunization campaigns. Dr. Bardan Jung Rana, a WHO medical officer in Indonesia, said the rise was not unexpected. Early May, the World Health Organisation confirmed that an 18-month-old child had been paralysed by polio in a village in west Java, Indonesia. WHO records show that several dozen patients in Indonesia developed polio after being vaccinated against the disease in the late 1990's. Since 2001, Indonesia has recorded no polio infections at all. The virus found in the Indonesian case closely matches samples collected in an outbreak in recent months in Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The WHO says with the Indonesian case, 16 countries have had wild-virus outbreaks since 2003. The polio virus enters the body through the mouth, usually from hands contaminated with the stool of an infected person. Polio is preventable by immunization. Polio eradication, the permanent global cessation of circulation by the poliovirus and hence elimination of the poliomyelitis (polio) it causes, is the aim of a multinational public health effort begun in 1988, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Rotary Foundation. There are two kinds of polio vaccine—oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses weakened poliovirus, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while the OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immunodeficient. Nigeria is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of wild poliovirus, with its last reported case in 2016. Wild poliovirus has been eradicated in all continents except Asia, and , Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two countries where the disease is still classified as endemic. Type3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio in 2012, and was declared eradicated in 2019. Vaccines against each of the three types have given rise to emergent strains of cVDPV, with cVDPV2 being most prominent, and such strains caused over 1,000 polio cases in 2020. Factors influencing eradication of polio \n\nEradication of polio has been defined in various ways—as elimination of the occurrence of poliomyelitis even in the absence of human intervention, as extinction of poliovirus, such that the infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory, as control of an infection to the point at which transmission of the disease ceased within a specified area, and as reduction of the worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis to zero as a result of deliberate efforts, and requiring no further control measures. Strategy \nThe most important step in eradication of polio is interruption of endemic transmission of poliovirus. Several key strategies have been outlined for stopping polio transmission:\n\n High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life in developing and endemic countries, and routine immunization with OPV and/or IPV elsewhere. Active surveillance for poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis. Expanded environmental surveillance to detect the presence of poliovirus in communities. Since most polio infections are asymptomatic, transmission can occur in spite of the absence of polio-related AFP cases, and such monitoring helps to evaluate the degree to which virus continues to circulate in an area. Targeted \"mop-up\" campaigns once poliovirus transmission is limited to specific geographical foci. The oral polio vaccine (OPV, or Sabin vaccine) contains an attenuated poliovirus, 10,000 times less able to enter the circulation and cause polio, delivered as oral drops or infused into sugar cubes. Because the immune response to oral polio vaccine is very similar to that of natural polio infection, it is expected that oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity to the virus. Until recent times, a trivalent OPV containing all three virus strains was used, but with the eradication of wild poliovirus type2 this was phased out in 2016 and replaced with bivalent vaccine containing just types 1 and 3, while use of monovalent type2 OPV is restricted to regions with documented cVDPV2 circulation. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV, or Salk) contains trivalent fully inactivated virus, administered by injection. As a consequence, vaccinated individuals are protected from contracting polio, but their intestinal mucosa may still be infected and serve as a reservoir for the excretion of live virus. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact, and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. Vaccine-derived poliovirus \n \n\nWhile vaccination has played an instrumental role in the reduction of polio cases worldwide, the use of attenuated virus in the oral vaccine carries with it an inherent risk. As a result of such circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains, polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus, but where vaccination rates have fallen. Stool samples are collected from children presenting with AFP and evaluated for the presence of poliovirus by accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. Since rates of non-polio AFP are expected to be constant and large compared to the number of polio cases, the frequency of non-polio AFP reported in a population is indicative of the effectiveness of surveillance, as is the proportion of AFP patients from whom high-quality stool samples are collected and tested, with a target of at least 80%. An independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the researchers concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity, but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, and inadequately resourced health facilities also posed problems, as did technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine. Two additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most individuals infected with poliovirus are asymptomatic or exhibit minor symptoms, with fewer than 1% of infections leading to paralysis, and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. In 2000, using new screening techniques for the molecular characterization of outbreak viral strains, it was discovered that some of the outbreaks were actually caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine. This discovery altered the strategy for the discontinuation of vaccination following polio eradication, necessitating an eventual switch to the more expensive and logistically more problematic inactivated polio vaccine, as continued use of the oral inactivated virus would continue to produce such revertant infection-causing strains. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, as a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine. He said that the biggest hurdle preventing Pakistan from becoming polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children. and added that, in spite of this, \"the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working.\" Opposition to vaccination efforts\n\nOne factor contributing to the continued circulation of polio immunization programs has been opposition in some countries. Refusal of vaccination came to be viewed as resistance to western expansionism, and when the contamination rumours led the Nigerian Supreme Council for Sharia to call for a region-wide boycott of polio vaccination, polio cases in the country increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2006, with the uncontrolled virus then spreading across Africa and globally. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, fears that the vaccine contained contraceptives were one reason given by the Taliban in issuing fatwas against polio vaccination. Pakistan reported the world's highest number of polio cases (198) in 2011. Polio vaccination efforts have also faced resistance in another form. Some governments have been accused of withholding vaccination or the necessary accompanying infrastructure from regions where opposition to their rule is high. Polio eradication criteria \nA country is regarded as polio free or non-endemic if no cases have been detected for a year. However, it is still possible polio circulates under these circumstances, as was the case for Nigeria, where a particular strain of virus resurfaced after five years in 2016. Moreover, for WPV1—the only type of the virus which is currently circulating following the eradication of WPV2 and WPV3—only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralysis in non-vaccinated children, and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children. Therefore, even a single case is considered an epidemic. In Pakistan in the last couple of years, the number of paralysis cases has dropped relatively faster than the positive environmental samples, which has shown no progress since 2015. For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated worldwide, at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved, though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3, where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms, or if virus-positive environmental samples continue to be reported. Wild poliovirus type2 was certified eradicated in 2015, the last case having been detected in 1999. Timeline\n\nPre-1988 \n\nFollowing the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. 1988–2000 \n\nIn 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO), together with Rotary International, UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) passed the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), with the goal of eradicating polio by the year 2000. The last case of wild poliovirus poliomyelitis in the Americas was reported in Peru, August 1991. In 1994, the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio. In 1998, Melik Minas of Turkey became the last case of polio reported in Europe. In 1997, Mum Chanty of Cambodia became the last person to contract polio in the Indo-West Pacific region. In 2000, the Western Pacific Region (including China) was certified polio-free. In October 1999, the last isolation of type2 poliovirus occurred in India. This type of poliovirus was declared eradicated. The World Health Organization announced that Europe was polio-free on 21 June 2002, in the Copenhagen Glyptotek. In 2002, an outbreak of polio occurred in India. The number of planned polio vaccination campaigns had recently been reduced, and populations in northern India, particularly from the Islamic background, engaged in mass resistance to immunization. At this time, the Indian state Uttar Pradesh accounted for nearly two-thirds of total worldwide cases reported. (See the 2002 Global polio incidence map.) However, by 2004, India had adopted strategies to increase ownership of polio vaccinations in marginalized populations, and the immunity gap in vulnerable groups rapidly closed. On 30 June 2004, the WHO announced that after a 10-month ban on polio vaccinations, Kano had pledged to restart the campaign in early July. During the ban the virus spread across Nigeria and into 12 neighboring countries that had previously been polio-free. In addition to the rumors of sterility and the ban by Nigeria's Kano state, civil war and internal strife in Sudan and Côte d'Ivoire have complicated WHO's polio eradication goal. In 2004, almost two-thirds of all the polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria (760 out of 1,170 total). In May 2004 the first case of the polio outbreak in Sudan was detected. In 2005 there were 1,979 cases of wild poliovirus (excludes vaccine-derived polio viruses). Using the Pulse Polio campaign to increase polio immunization rates, India recorded just 66 cases in 2005, down from 135 cases reported in 2004, 225 in 2003, and 1,600 in 2002. Yemen, Indonesia, and Sudan, countries that had been declared polio-free since before 2000, each reported hundreds of cases—probably imported from Nigeria. On 5 May 2005, news reports broke that a new case of polio was diagnosed in Java, Indonesia, and the virus strain was suspected to be the same as the one that has caused outbreaks in Nigeria. New public fears over vaccine safety, which were unfounded, impeded vaccination efforts in Indonesia. In summer 2005, the WHO, UNICEF and the Indonesian government made new efforts to lay the fears to rest, recruiting celebrities and religious leaders in a publicity campaign to promote vaccination. In the United States on 29 September 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health identified the first occurrence of vaccine derived polio virus (VDPV) transmission in the United States since OPV was discontinued in 2000. The poliovirus type1 infection occurred in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged seven months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were not vaccinated for polio. 2006–2010 \n\nIn 2006, only four countries in the world (Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) were reported to have endemic polio. A total of 1,997 cases worldwide were reported in 2006; of these the majority (1,869 cases) occurred in countries with endemic polio. Nigeria accounted for the majority of cases (1,122 cases) but India reported more than ten times more cases this year than in 2005 (676 cases, or 30% of worldwide cases). Polio re-surfaced in Bangladesh after nearly six years of absence with 18 new cases reported. (See: Map of reported polio cases in 2006)\n\nIn 2007, there were 1,315 cases of poliomyelitis reported worldwide. Over 60% of cases (874) occurred in India; while in Nigeria, the number of polio cases fell dramatically, from 1,122 cases reported in 2006 to 285 cases in 2007. Local governments and clerics allowed vaccinations to resume on the condition that the vaccines be manufactured in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country, and not in the United States. Attending the launch of immunization campaigns in Birnin Kebbi in July 2007, Turai Yar'Adua urged parents to vaccinate their children and stressed the safety of oral polio vaccine. In July 2007, a student traveling from Pakistan imported the first polio case to Australia in over 20 years. Other countries with significant numbers of wild polio virus cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which reported 41 cases, Chad with 22 cases, and Niger and Myanmar, each of which reported 11 cases. According to figures updated in April 2012, the WHO reported that there were 1,352 cases of wild polio in 20 countries in 2010. Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year, with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) and an increase in cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases). Polio transmission recurred in Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kenya reported its first case since 2009, while China reported 21 cases, mostly among the Uyghurs of Hotan prefecture, Xinjiang, the first cases since 1994. Several additional countries, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Yemen, saw outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio. In April, a case of wild polio in Mogadishu was reported, the first in Somalia since 2007. Routine sewage monitoring in 2012 had detected a WPV1 strain of Pakistani origin in Cairo, sparking a major vaccination push there. The strain spread to Israel, where there was widespread environmental detection, but like Egypt, no paralysis cases. The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries, and also dictated a switch to inactivated virus injections, to avoid the risk of the vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus oral vaccine.

That could mean that preliminary results will be available in 2016, although Biogen Idec's R&D head Doug Williams said discussions are still ongoing with regulators about the design of the pivotal trial. It was derived from antibodies taken from donors who were cognitively normal despite advanced age, on the hypothesis that these donors' immune systems had successfully resisted Alzheimer's disease. BAN3401 and E2609 are now entering phase II trials, said Scangos. Biogen Idec reported a near-doubling in fourth-quarter profit to $884m on the back of strong sales of its multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise, although the roll-out of oral therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) overseas hid a slowdown in the US market. Biogen Idec was also buoyed by a $40m contribution in the fourth-quarter from long-acting Avonex follow-up Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a), and the company said expects Tecfidera growth to resume in the US and accelerate in Europe, where to date it is only available and reimbursed in a handful of markets including Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain. Its goal is to address the \"valley of death\" between research, discovery, and early clinical-stage drug development. Projects are advanced by the management team through clinical proof-of-concept and then out-licensed via strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies. While at IDEC, Rastetter was a co-inventor of Rituxan,  which it co-marketed with Genentech. This was certainly the case at Idec Pharmaceuticals. – Rastetter, 2006\" In 2003, Idec Pharmaceuticals merged with Biogen to form the third largest biotech firm in the United States. Following the merger, Rastetter became the executive chair of the new company, Biogen IDEC (2003–2005). Biogen has acquired an experimental drug for a type of deadly stroke, adding to the belief that the company, under new CEO Michel Vounatsos, will be more aggressive in pursuing deals to stock its pipeline.

        "context": "Biogen Idec is working hard to catapult its Alzheimer's disease candidate BIIB037 into phase III trials, in the wake of \"compelling\" data reported last month, according to chief executive George Scangos. That could mean that preliminary results will be available in 2016, although Biogen Idec's R&D head Doug Williams said discussions are still ongoing with regulators about the design of the pivotal trial. It was derived from antibodies taken from donors who were cognitively normal despite advanced age, on the hypothesis that these donors' immune systems had successfully resisted Alzheimer's disease. BAN3401 and E2609 are now entering phase II trials, said Scangos. Biogen Idec reported a near-doubling in fourth-quarter profit to $884m on the back of strong sales of its multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise, although the roll-out of oral therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) overseas hid a slowdown in the US market. Biogen Idec was also buoyed by a $40m contribution in the fourth-quarter from long-acting Avonex follow-up Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a), and the company said expects Tecfidera growth to resume in the US and accelerate in Europe, where to date it is only available and reimbursed in a handful of markets including Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain. Its goal is to address the \"valley of death\" between research, discovery, and early clinical-stage drug development. Projects are advanced by the management team through clinical proof-of-concept and then out-licensed via strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies.

Following the merger, Rastetter became the executive chair of the new company, Biogen IDEC (2003–2005).

At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. The device is an adaptation of early “heart-lung machines;” among the first iterations was a model created in the 1920s by research with canines. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Manifestations of the condition vary, but, as in the case with Tetralogy of Fallot, it is often associated with cyanosis. Like many pediatric cardiologists, Lincoln’s surgeons faced challenges that make their success all the more remarkable: the seven-month-old went into cardiac arrest as they waited for the donor organ needed for his transplant—which necessitated an emergency surgery to compress his heart. This, followed by the transplantation, is especially tough on the tiny body of an infant patient. It’s not easy for family members in the waiting room, either. All over the world, scientists and researchers rely on animal models to discover more about how to detect and treat congenital heart defects—offering infants like Lincoln, and Kimmel’s son, a second chance at life. The innovations in medical devices and surgical techniques that result from this work have enabled healthcare providers to perform magic, one baby’s beating heart at a time. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. Kimmel was a member of Temple Emanu-El in New York City. Kimmel died April 15, 2008. Most people with heart failure do not need surgery and will be treated with drugs. Heart surgery is only done when doctors think it will improve a problem with the heart valves or the blood supply of the heart, and if the heart is strong enough. In most cases surgery cannot cure heart failure. Surgery that can be used to improve heart failure includes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgery and heart transplantation (see also ‘Medical devices for heart failure' and 'heart transplants for heart failure'). Another woman who had avoided seeing doctors about her heart for many years was given a new mitral valve and said the operation changed her life. She persuaded her surgeon to operate on her and felt her quality of life improved. She describes how wonderful she felt after her mitral valve was replaced. And just a good job that he was here because I collapsed and got rushed into hospital, spent 7 weeks in there because, you know, having 5 operations is a bit dicey as you can well imagine. And I finally got admitted to hospital in London and the surgeon there looked at my notes and he said, 'Definitely not, you've had far too many operations'. And I said to him 'oh dear' and he said, 'You surely don't want me to operate on you?' The last one, the surgeon fitted an artificial, a metal valve, a Starr-Edwards valve it's called. And this was the surgeon who'd had to have time to think about whether he was going to operate? Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG, pronounced \"cabbage\") is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. This new blood vessel is known as a graft (for more on CABG see Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery on our Heart Attack website). People can have CABG surgery following a heart attack, several months later, or following tests results such as an angiogram. Sab avoided a heart attack just because during a consultation for a lung condition he told the consultant about his chest pain. It showed that his artery was so bad that it would be dangerous to put a stent in and doctors decided to do a triple bypass instead. One man described how he felt when he was told during his angiogram that he would need bypass surgery immediately. Tests showed he needed bypass surgery. He felt devastated when he was told that he needed bypass surgery one week after his heart attack. So we went to see the my own specialist, the chest was fine, I had a bronchiectasis and he was saying that we now those tablet's working and I don't need to see you for another year which I was very pleased. My wife jumped in and said, \"Tell him about the pain you had,\" and he sort of looked at me and said, \"What pain?\" But then when you're taken to [the specialist hospital] and you actually see on the screen the effects of what's going on and then somebody says, 'we're requesting surgical intervention immediately,' it is a shock of some magnitude. The nurse then that was on the ward, she was just terrific. One man reported how the surgeon described the operation to him before he asked him to sign the consent form for bypass surgery. Her doctors disagreed about whether she should have bypass surgery at her age. He felt well informed before he signed the consent form for bypass surgery two weeks after his heart attack. He asked the surgeon how many bypass operations he had done before he consented to surgery. Is this another heart attack? I ended up in intensive care and then I ended up being taken to [the specialist] hospital where the same thing happened again. You're too old to be operated on. So they were getting me ready in the morning, had my breakfast, got up, went to the bathroom and had another heart attack. And I was taken down to the operating theatre and operated on and it was a success. You see I could quite understand they don't want to lose a patient, it's not good for them to lose a patient and if the chances are 50/50, I think they'd rather take their 50 on their side and have you die at home than on their table. The surgeon, I think he was a very good communicator. After the operation he came back and he explained everything he had done. And he explained that progressively they was going to remove all the different pipes, and the purpose for them and everything else, and I thought it was marvellous that a surgeon would take the time out to explain everything he was going to do, or had done, in the next few days. And I was very, very impressed with this surgeon, I've got to be truthful. So the only person that was really good, as far as I was concerned, was the surgeon and he didn't mince his words, you know, he spat it straight out. I knew the risk from living and dying on the operation or from a stroke and everything else and that's the way I like it, I knew exactly where I stood. I'm telling you this because one of the things that the surgeon told us was that the, one of the things that I wanted to know from the surgeon was how many of these things had he done. Was he, sort of, did he know what he was doing and he told me, this was September, he told me by that time he had done about 140 bypass operations that year. And I also asked him what the prognosis was and he told me that 95% of all cases of, who have bypass surgery are successful, and 5% are not. He said mostly what can go wrong is that you get some kind of sepsis and we can fix that. So I thought the odds were pretty good, bearing in mind that my cardiologist said I've got to have this done, not much choice. Some people felt they wanted to have surgery; for instance a man who had CABG surgery because doctors thought it would prevent sudden death, said that he wanted to feel everything was being done that could be done (for more information see 'Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome' Information sheet from the British Heart Foundation January 2013). He had bypass surgery to reduce his chances of sudden death. I think my family were keen though that I had the surgery and it was important to me that everything was being demonstrated to be done that could be done. So I had the surgery, and then I hit the problems that nurses and doctors get when they're in the hands of their colleagues. Sometimes people had expected tests to lead to some kind of surgery and felt slightly disappointed to learn that surgery would not help them. In Brian’s case an angiogram revealed that his heart would no longer be able to cope with surgery. It took him some time to realise that surgery wouldn't help his heart failure. Brian explains why he didn’t have any more surgery after his pacemaker was fitted. Well, the, the pacemaker was fitted in eight years ago, so, so that was minor surgery and it was in 2005 which is six years ago that I had , I believe it’s called an angiogram but the; I had a number of tubes shoved up from my groin into my heart. I had no symptoms of a problem prior to that but, but it is believed that, that, the poor fitting of the two valves resulted in the heart having to work harder and this resulted in the left ventricle weakening and so the decision was taken that heart surgery would not help me and therefore the only invasion of my body that I’ve had [laughs] is a pacemaker and an angiogram but I’ve had no other surgery. When surgery had led to further complications and people had to stay in hospital longer than expected they said their families often felt under strain. Several said that they were disappointed not to recover from bypass surgery as fast as others around them; one man said that he had expected his bypass to make his heart better but was told afterwards that it was more damaged than he had thought. His by-pass surgery didn't make him feel any better. I get slightly annoyed, though I'm happy for other people who get bypass surgery and feel wonderful afterwards, I think it was just, I was just treated under the assumption that I've had the surgery and I was gonna be fully fit, fully operative and so interestingly at that point stopped, because that was supposed to be corrective. The medicine that I'm on, the treatment with medicine, is not going to cure, it will prevent hopefully, any further damage, or will slow down further damage, it won't cure it, and I'm all right with that, because I could be an awful lot worse off than what I am, and it has been explained to me, by the powers that be, that if it does get worse, what the position is gonna be. 'when the surgeon cut me open he would have said 'What the hell have we got here? However, some people need more than one bypass and so it may take longer depending on how many blood vessels are being grafted (NHS Choices, April 2012). Sab talks about how he felt and looked like following his CABG surgery. I was still under Intensive Care so and then one; I had, the one thing that really was irritating, I had an oxygen in my nose and making… the mask I had with wire… loads of wire from here, here – chest and you don't do nothing, you just lie there, you're almost as good as dead. But the support from nurses and the people in charge, it was so brilliant, they were there to make sure that, reassure you that you are alright. Recovering from surgery could take time. Sometimes surgery did not go as well as planned and several people had experienced pain; one man said it had taken 2 years to get the original surgery corrected. He describes the pain he felt after his first operation and how he needed to have the bones in his chest re-aligned. In 1993 when I had the operation you know they opened the chest okay, when they put it back they didn't put it back straight, the ribs weren't like this, they were not in line they were like this. And I saw other patients with you know who had similar operations and they recovered, twenty days after the operation they're fine, six months later everything is forgotten and it's gone. The nurse before the operation said \"What do you think about this, this, this?\" So I signed the form, went to the operation and they aligned the, re-aligned the bones together. It takes most people several months to recover after the operation. Sab talks about what he was able to do at the various stages of his recovery.

And I was very, very impressed with this surgeon, I've got to be truthful. So the only person that was really good, as far as I was concerned, was the surgeon and he didn't mince his words, you know, he spat it straight out. I knew the risk from living and dying on the operation or from a stroke and everything else and that's the way I like it, I knew exactly where I stood. I'm telling you this because one of the things that the surgeon told us was that the, one of the things that I wanted to know from the surgeon was how many of these things had he done. Was he, sort of, did he know what he was doing and he told me, this was September, he told me by that time he had done about 140 bypass operations that year. And I also asked him what the prognosis was and he told me that 95% of all cases of, who have bypass surgery are successful, and 5% are not. He said mostly what can go wrong is that you get some kind of sepsis and we can fix that. So I thought the odds were pretty good, bearing in mind that my cardiologist said I've got to have this done, not much choice. Some people felt they wanted to have surgery; for instance a man who had CABG surgery because doctors thought it would prevent sudden death, said that he wanted to feel everything was being done that could be done (for more information see 'Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome' Information sheet from the British Heart Foundation January 2013). He had bypass surgery to reduce his chances of sudden death. I think my family were keen though that I had the surgery and it was important to me that everything was being demonstrated to be done that could be done. So I had the surgery, and then I hit the problems that nurses and doctors get when they're in the hands of their colleagues. Sometimes people had expected tests to lead to some kind of surgery and felt slightly disappointed to learn that surgery would not help them. In Brian’s case an angiogram revealed that his heart would no longer be able to cope with surgery. It took him some time to realise that surgery wouldn't help his heart failure. Brian explains why he didn’t have any more surgery after his pacemaker was fitted. Well, the, the pacemaker was fitted in eight years ago, so, so that was minor surgery and it was in 2005 which is six years ago that I had , I believe it’s called an angiogram but the; I had a number of tubes shoved up from my groin into my heart. I had no symptoms of a problem prior to that but, but it is believed that, that, the poor fitting of the two valves resulted in the heart having to work harder and this resulted in the left ventricle weakening and so the decision was taken that heart surgery would not help me and therefore the only invasion of my body that I’ve had [laughs] is a pacemaker and an angiogram but I’ve had no other surgery. When surgery had led to further complications and people had to stay in hospital longer than expected they said their families often felt under strain. Several said that they were disappointed not to recover from bypass surgery as fast as others around them; one man said that he had expected his bypass to make his heart better but was told afterwards that it was more damaged than he had thought. His by-pass surgery didn't make him feel any better. I get slightly annoyed, though I'm happy for other people who get bypass surgery and feel wonderful afterwards, I think it was just, I was just treated under the assumption that I've had the surgery and I was gonna be fully fit, fully operative and so interestingly at that point stopped, because that was supposed to be corrective. The medicine that I'm on, the treatment with medicine, is not going to cure, it will prevent hopefully, any further damage, or will slow down further damage, it won't cure it, and I'm all right with that, because I could be an awful lot worse off than what I am, and it has been explained to me, by the powers that be, that if it does get worse, what the position is gonna be. 'when the surgeon cut me open he would have said 'What the hell have we got here? However, some people need more than one bypass and so it may take longer depending on how many blood vessels are being grafted (NHS Choices, April 2012). Sab talks about how he felt and looked like following his CABG surgery. I was still under Intensive Care so and then one; I had, the one thing that really was irritating, I had an oxygen in my nose and making… the mask I had with wire… loads of wire from here, here – chest and you don't do nothing, you just lie there, you're almost as good as dead. But the support from nurses and the people in charge, it was so brilliant, they were there to make sure that, reassure you that you are alright. Recovering from surgery could take time. Sometimes surgery did not go as well as planned and several people had experienced pain; one man said it had taken 2 years to get the original surgery corrected. He describes the pain he felt after his first operation and how he needed to have the bones in his chest re-aligned. In 1993 when I had the operation you know they opened the chest okay, when they put it back they didn't put it back straight, the ribs weren't like this, they were not in line they were like this. And I saw other patients with you know who had similar operations and they recovered, twenty days after the operation they're fine, six months later everything is forgotten and it's gone. The nurse before the operation said \"What do you think about this, this, this?\" So I signed the form, went to the operation and they aligned the, re-aligned the bones together. It takes most people several months to recover after the operation. Sab talks about what he was able to do at the various stages of his recovery. For more on surgery for heart failure see our resources. first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system.\n\n"

        "origin_prompt": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nBackground:A new study by Italian researchers investigated whether the use of pulsed radiofrequency can help relieve lower back pain and sciatica. This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. The injections are given directly into the area of the spine affected. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. Some may, therefore, require surgery, with some requiring the disc to be removed. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. The comparative study comparing the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain found that both CRF and PRF were effective in relieving pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia. Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain. Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. The main advantages of RF seem to be its effectiveness and high pain relief rate without the dangerous complications of surgical procedures  and lack of secondary effects and reduction of oral medication . Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk for recurrence but a higher risk for complications requiring hospitalization . The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus PRF in the treatment of ITN pain. All procedures were performed in the operating room. After the stimulation period, the patient was given 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1–2 mg/kg propofol. Trial stimulation:First, sensory stimulation at 100 Hz was performed with 0.1–0.5 V to search for a tingling sensation at the affected branch, which is the trigeminal nerve branch innervating the trigger zone. We continued to lesion in 5°C increments for 60 s until we reached a maximum of 80°C for 60 s. At each stage, the patient was allowed to recover from the intravenous propofol, and we tested for reduction of response to pinprick stimulation. In the PRF group, a PRF current at a dose of 500 pulses was given to the affected branch, and then we tested the affected area for severity of pain. If the pain was still present, we gave another pulsed dose, and then we examined for pain relief until we covered beyond the trigger area and did not exceed a temperature of 42°C. Patients were evaluated as regards their pain intensity using VAS, patient satisfaction using Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS), the need for additional pharmacological treatment, side effects, complications, and the need for repeating the use of RF treatment. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the presence of complications on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF on the first day, at first week, at first month, and at 3 months after treatment. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF at 6 months after treatment [Table 3]. Pain recurrence after one or more surgical operations is also frequently seen. Surgical and interventional procedures include glycerol injection, percutaneous balloon microdecompression, rhizotomy, thermocoagulation with RF, microvascular decompression, and gamma knife radiosurgery, all of which may be necessary when other treatments fail, but have different surgical risks . As regards pain relief, there was a significant improvement in VAS in both groups throughout the follow-up period; follow-up was scheduled on the first day, at first week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. stated that thermocoagulation offers the highest rates of complete pain relief; this is in agreement with the present study, as we found a highly significant difference in VAS scores at different time points of follow-up compared with pretreatment results. This is nearly the same with respect to patient satisfaction in the present study, as patients were satisfied in both groups until the 6 months Less satisfaction was observed in the PRF group; this may be due to the temporary effects of PRF on the nerve rather than the permanent changes caused by CRF. On comparing the studied groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. We needed repetition of the procedure for 12 patients in the PRF group after 6 months of follow-up; Fraioli and colleagues repeated the procedure in 10 patients. This is different from our results as there were statistical differences between the two groups at 6 months, which may be due to the use of PRF for 10 min and in a pulsed manner for 2 min only. The VAS scores decreased in only two of 20 patients from the PRF group (group 2) and these two patients had achieved considerable pain relief after the procedure. The pain relief lasted 3 months and pain recurrence occurred after 3 months of the procedure. Overall, there was greater satisfaction in the CRF group compared with the PRF group at 6-month follow-up, but without statistical significance. Supervisor of the study decided to perform CRF in group 2, because they still had pain. In present study, we found that there was a need for repetition of the procedure after 6 months for only two patients in the CRF group and 12 patients in the PRF group, which showed high statistical difference between the two groups. The results of Erdine and colleagues are in agreement with our results as no complications were observed in the intraoperative period or in the early postoperative period. After the procedures, as a side effect, five of 20 patients from group 1 and three of 20 patients from group 2 reported moderate headache for 24 h. In all patients from group 1, there was mild hypoesthesia and parasthesias after the procedure. Anesthesia dolorosa occurred in one patient and medical treatment was given. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN. Unlike CRF, this is associated with neuritis-like reactions and motor deficits, whereas PRF seems to have transient side effects.

Radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency treatment of chronic pain syndromes: the available evidence Pain Pract 2008; 8:385–393. A study conducted by Alessandro Napoli and his team at Sapienza University in Rome investigated the use of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) as a treatment for back pain resulting from lumbar disk herniation. The study included 128 patients who had not responded to conservative treatment for their back pain. These patients underwent CT-guided pRF, which delivers energy pulses to the root of the nerve for 10 minutes. In comparison, another group of 120 participants received CT-guided steroid injections without pRF. Patients who received pulsed radiofrequency reported improvements in pain and disability scores. They also experienced quicker relief from leg pain and perceived faster recovery times. Based on these results, the researchers suggest offering pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disks and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy. This can be an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments, such as surgery or corticosteroid injections. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment is relatively non-invasive, only lasting 10 minutes, and a single session was sufficient for many patients in the study. In summary, the study on CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency as a treatment for back pain from lumbar disk herniation demonstrated favorable outcomes, including improved pain and disability scores, faster leg pain relief, and quicker perceived recovery times. This approach may offer benefits to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments and could potentially help them avoid invasive surgery or corticosteroid injections.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": "A new study by Italian researchers investigated whether the use of pulsed radiofrequency can help relieve lower back pain and sciatica. This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. The injections are given directly into the area of the spine affected. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. Some may, therefore, require surgery, with some requiring the disc to be removed. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. The comparative study comparing the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain found that both CRF and PRF were effective in relieving pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia. Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain. Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. The main advantages of RF seem to be its effectiveness and high pain relief rate without the dangerous complications of surgical procedures  and lack of secondary effects and reduction of oral medication . Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk for recurrence but a higher risk for complications requiring hospitalization . The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus PRF in the treatment of ITN pain. All procedures were performed in the operating room. After the stimulation period, the patient was given 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1–2 mg/kg propofol. Trial stimulation:First, sensory stimulation at 100 Hz was performed with 0.1–0.5 V to search for a tingling sensation at the affected branch, which is the trigeminal nerve branch innervating the trigger zone. We continued to lesion in 5°C increments for 60 s until we reached a maximum of 80°C for 60 s. At each stage, the patient was allowed to recover from the intravenous propofol, and we tested for reduction of response to pinprick stimulation. In the PRF group, a PRF current at a dose of 500 pulses was given to the affected branch, and then we tested the affected area for severity of pain. If the pain was still present, we gave another pulsed dose, and then we examined for pain relief until we covered beyond the trigger area and did not exceed a temperature of 42°C. Patients were evaluated as regards their pain intensity using VAS, patient satisfaction using Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS), the need for additional pharmacological treatment, side effects, complications, and the need for repeating the use of RF treatment. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the presence of complications on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF on the first day, at first week, at first month, and at 3 months after treatment. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF at 6 months after treatment [Table 3]. Pain recurrence after one or more surgical operations is also frequently seen. Surgical and interventional procedures include glycerol injection, percutaneous balloon microdecompression, rhizotomy, thermocoagulation with RF, microvascular decompression, and gamma knife radiosurgery, all of which may be necessary when other treatments fail, but have different surgical risks . As regards pain relief, there was a significant improvement in VAS in both groups throughout the follow-up period; follow-up was scheduled on the first day, at first week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. stated that thermocoagulation offers the highest rates of complete pain relief; this is in agreement with the present study, as we found a highly significant difference in VAS scores at different time points of follow-up compared with pretreatment results. This is nearly the same with respect to patient satisfaction in the present study, as patients were satisfied in both groups until the 6 months Less satisfaction was observed in the PRF group; this may be due to the temporary effects of PRF on the nerve rather than the permanent changes caused by CRF. On comparing the studied groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. We needed repetition of the procedure for 12 patients in the PRF group after 6 months of follow-up; Fraioli and colleagues repeated the procedure in 10 patients. This is different from our results as there were statistical differences between the two groups at 6 months, which may be due to the use of PRF for 10 min and in a pulsed manner for 2 min only. The VAS scores decreased in only two of 20 patients from the PRF group (group 2) and these two patients had achieved considerable pain relief after the procedure. The pain relief lasted 3 months and pain recurrence occurred after 3 months of the procedure. Overall, there was greater satisfaction in the CRF group compared with the PRF group at 6-month follow-up, but without statistical significance. Supervisor of the study decided to perform CRF in group 2, because they still had pain. In present study, we found that there was a need for repetition of the procedure after 6 months for only two patients in the CRF group and 12 patients in the PRF group, which showed high statistical difference between the two groups. The results of Erdine and colleagues are in agreement with our results as no complications were observed in the intraoperative period or in the early postoperative period. After the procedures, as a side effect, five of 20 patients from group 1 and three of 20 patients from group 2 reported moderate headache for 24 h. In all patients from group 1, there was mild hypoesthesia and parasthesias after the procedure. Anesthesia dolorosa occurred in one patient and medical treatment was given. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN. Unlike CRF, this is associated with neuritis-like reactions and motor deficits, whereas PRF seems to have transient side effects.

A lawsuit has been filed in California Superior Court on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during early pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a severe heart defect. According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication. September 1 – Lawsuit filed today in the Central District of California by a mother who blames GSK for failing to warn about the risk of birth defects from Zofran. Plaintiff asserts that she has no family history of neural tube defects, and that her daughter’s problems are the result of exposure to Zofran in the womb. September 29 – An Alameda County couple filed a lawsuit today in San Francisco federal court alleging that the mother’s use of Zofran during pregnancy caused their daughter to be born with severe heart damage that required open heart surgery. November 6 – A man and wife from Florida filed suit against GSK today in a federal court in San Francisco alleging that the woman’s use of Zofran for morning sickness during pregnancy caused their son to be born with a bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate. The boy underwent his first medical intervention within weeks of being born and had has first surgery before the age of one year, yet continues to suffer developmental delays and problems with eating, drinking and hearing, according to the complaint.

A teratogen is an agent such as drugs, medications, infections, or chemicals causing birth defects or harm to a fetus. Zofran, an antiemetic medication, is potentially linked to birth defects including cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defect (CHD). If you took Zofran during your first trimester of pregnancy, and have a child with birth defects, contact us for a free case consultation. The complaint is filed on behalf of a little boy who was born with Supraventricular Tachycardia,or SVT, a serious heart birth defect. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kershaw and Mr. Talley allege the child’s birth defect was suffered after his mother took Zofran, also known as Ondansetron, during her first trimester of pregnancy. According to the filing, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran, off-label, to alleviate morning sickness she experienced in the early weeks of her pregnancy. The complaint alleges the little boy’s SVT was the direct result of exposure to Zofran in utero. A frequently asked question from potential clients is, “Do I have a Zofran case?” As you may know, Zofran is linked to various birth defects. Typically, in these cases, the mother took Zofran during her first trimester of pregnancy and her child is born with a birth defect(s). The other factor to take into consideration is the type of birth defect. Right now, there is limited research and scientific data connecting Zofran use during pregnancy with birth defects. So, if you just discovered the link between Zofran and birth defects, the statute would start to run from the date of that discovery. If a defendant is intentionally concealing a link between a drug and a birth defect, that concealment or fraud can “toll” the statute of limitations. So, if you took Zofran and have a child with a birth defect, it’s very important to call an attorney immediately. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Mar 24, 2015 | Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? This was first evidenced by the thalidomide tragedy during the post-war era of the 1960’s. Thalidomide was a sleeping pill and tranquilizer marketed as safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it was anything but safe for the fetus. Severe birth defects secondary to Thalidomide prompted the start of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drug approval and monitoring systems. According to The Thalidomide Tragedy: Lessons for Drug Safety and Regulation, “They advertised their product as “completely safe” for everyone, including mother and child, “even during pregnancy,” as its developers “could not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.” This is analogous with GlaxoSmithKline and their advertising of Zofran as safe during pregnancy. Additionally, reproduction studies testing Zofran and it’s teratogenic effects were only performed on pregnant rabbits and rats, much like thalidomide. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The ramifications from a lack of testing on human subjects was substantiated with thalidomide. It’s ironic how the thalidomide tragedy catalyzed the FDA’s rigorous drug testing standards yet these standards don’t appear to have been applied to Zofran. Around the 1960’s, it was discovered thalidomide also alleviated morning sickness. It was subsequently prescribed for off-label use in pregnant patients. In the U.S. today, Zofran is prescribed off-label to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. And similar to Thalidomide, it may cause birth defects. So, how do drugs like Zofran cause birth defects? In the case of Thalidomide, it was discovered that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. In other words, the dosage’s rate of transfer from the mother’s blood stream to the unborn child is significant. Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? On March 17th, a ValleyNewsLive.com segment reported on a North Dakota woman treated with Zofran, the antiemetic, during her pregnancy. In 2014, Dr. Gideon Koren of the The Motherisk Program of Toronto, Canada released a study detailing fetal safety concerns regarding Zofran. This is only the latest of several reports raising awareness about the link between Zofran and significant birth defects. We continually follow developments regarding Zofran and it’s association with birth defects as part of our firm’s ongoing investigation into this matter. We currently evaluate potential Zofran cases on behalf of families whose child was allegedly born with a birth defect secondary to in utero exposure to this drug. Mothers, Cheri Flynn and Tomisha LeClair, were unaware there was a risk of birth defects when they took Zofran, an anti-emetic, for morning sickness during their pregnancies. The physicians prescribing Zofran were also unaware of these risks. However, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturers of Zofran, knew about the potential chance of birth defects, and illegally marketed and promoted the drug to physicians as safe for use in pregnant women. Therefore, doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but GlaxoSmithKline cannot legally promote those uses. Ms. Flynn and Ms. LeClair filed product liability lawsuits against GlaxoSmithKline in February 2015. They both claim Zofran (Ondansetron) use during their respective pregnancies caused severe birth defects in their children. The respective lawsuits assert GlaxoSmithKline failed to warn consumers and medical professionals of the link between Zofran (Ondansetron) and an elevated risk of congenital heart defects, cleft lip and cleft palate. Ms. Flynn took Zofran during two of her pregnancies. Her complaint alleges taking Zofran during her pregnancies caused congenital heart defects in her children who were born in 2004 and 2006; Ms. LeClair claims her daughter suffers from heart malformations and a permanent developmental delay secondary to Zofran (Ondansetron) use during her pregnancy. This is not GlaxoSmithKline’s first time falsely misleading the public. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for promoting and marketing Zofran for off-label uses to doctors. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but the manufacturers of Zofran cannot promote those uses. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) manufactures Zofran. They directly promoted and marketed Zofran for off-label uses (i.e. This is illegal. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for these illegal practices. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, most major birth defects occur within the first trimester. The researchers found an increased risk of obstructive defects of the renal pelvis and ureter (tube expelling urine from kidneys). Additionally, there was a 20% increased risk of a major birth defect among children exposed to ondansetron (Zofran) in the first trimester. Or did you take a generic version of Zofran, such as Ondansetron? If Congenital Heart Defect, what type? A number of recent studies have explored the alleged connections between maternal use of Zofran and devastating birth defects, including one notable study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology in December 2014, which found double the risk of “hole in the heart” birth defects in babies exposed to Zofran during the first trimester of pregnancy, and a 62% increased risk of birth defects overall. In 2011, a large study conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Slone Epidemiology Center in Massachusetts, reported a two-times increased risk of cleft palate birth defects among children exposed to Zofran during the early stages of pregnancy, when a developing fetus is most susceptible to harm. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against GSK for allegedly marketing Zofran as an off-label treatment for pregnant women, which is illegal, and the drug maker was ordered to pay $3 billion to resolve the claims.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

So, if you took Zofran and have a child with a birth defect, it’s very important to call an attorney immediately. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Mar 24, 2015 | Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? This was first evidenced by the thalidomide tragedy during the post-war era of the 1960’s. Thalidomide was a sleeping pill and tranquilizer marketed as safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it was anything but safe for the fetus. Severe birth defects secondary to Thalidomide prompted the start of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drug approval and monitoring systems. According to The Thalidomide Tragedy: Lessons for Drug Safety and Regulation, “They advertised their product as “completely safe” for everyone, including mother and child, “even during pregnancy,” as its developers “could not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.” This is analogous with GlaxoSmithKline and their advertising of Zofran as safe during pregnancy. Additionally, reproduction studies testing Zofran and it’s teratogenic effects were only performed on pregnant rabbits and rats, much like thalidomide. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The ramifications from a lack of testing on human subjects was substantiated with thalidomide. It’s ironic how the thalidomide tragedy catalyzed the FDA’s rigorous drug testing standards yet these standards don’t appear to have been applied to Zofran. Around the 1960’s, it was discovered thalidomide also alleviated morning sickness. It was subsequently prescribed for off-label use in pregnant patients. In the U.S. today, Zofran is prescribed off-label to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. And similar to Thalidomide, it may cause birth defects. So, how do drugs like Zofran cause birth defects? In the case of Thalidomide, it was discovered that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. In other words, the dosage’s rate of transfer from the mother’s blood stream to the unborn child is significant. Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? On March 17th, a ValleyNewsLive.com segment reported on a North Dakota woman treated with Zofran, the antiemetic, during her pregnancy. In 2014, Dr. Gideon Koren of the The Motherisk Program of Toronto, Canada released a study detailing fetal safety concerns regarding Zofran. This is only the latest of several reports raising awareness about the link between Zofran and significant birth defects. We continually follow developments regarding Zofran and it’s association with birth defects as part of our firm’s ongoing investigation into this matter. We currently evaluate potential Zofran cases on behalf of families whose child was allegedly born with a birth defect secondary to in utero exposure to this drug. Mothers, Cheri Flynn and Tomisha LeClair, were unaware there was a risk of birth defects when they took Zofran, an anti-emetic, for morning sickness during their pregnancies. The physicians prescribing Zofran were also unaware of these risks. However, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturers of Zofran, knew about the potential chance of birth defects, and illegally marketed and promoted the drug to physicians as safe for use in pregnant women. Therefore, doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but GlaxoSmithKline cannot legally promote those uses. Ms. Flynn and Ms. LeClair filed product liability lawsuits against GlaxoSmithKline in February 2015. They both claim Zofran (Ondansetron) use during their respective pregnancies caused severe birth defects in their children. The respective lawsuits assert GlaxoSmithKline failed to warn consumers and medical professionals of the link between Zofran (Ondansetron) and an elevated risk of congenital heart defects, cleft lip and cleft palate. Ms. Flynn took Zofran during two of her pregnancies. Her complaint alleges taking Zofran during her pregnancies caused congenital heart defects in her children who were born in 2004 and 2006; Ms. LeClair claims her daughter suffers from heart malformations and a permanent developmental delay secondary to Zofran (Ondansetron) use during her pregnancy. This is not GlaxoSmithKline’s first time falsely misleading the public. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for promoting and marketing Zofran for off-label uses to doctors. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but the manufacturers of Zofran cannot promote those uses. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) manufactures Zofran. They directly promoted and marketed Zofran for off-label uses (i.e. This is illegal. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for these illegal practices. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, most major birth defects occur within the first trimester. The researchers found an increased risk of obstructive defects of the renal pelvis and ureter (tube expelling urine from kidneys). Additionally, there was a 20% increased risk of a major birth defect among children exposed to ondansetron (Zofran) in the first trimester. Or did you take a generic version of Zofran, such as Ondansetron? If Congenital Heart Defect, what type? A number of recent studies have explored the alleged connections between maternal use of Zofran and devastating birth defects, including one notable study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology in December 2014, which found double the risk of “hole in the heart” birth defects in babies exposed to Zofran during the first trimester of pregnancy, and a 62% increased risk of birth defects overall. In 2011, a large study conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Slone Epidemiology Center in Massachusetts, reported a two-times increased risk of cleft palate birth defects among children exposed to Zofran during the early stages of pregnancy, when a developing fetus is most susceptible to harm. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against GSK for allegedly marketing Zofran as an off-label treatment for pregnant women, which is illegal, and the drug maker was ordered to pay $3 billion to resolve the claims.\n\n"

The Department of Health (DOH) designated infections of the H7N9 avian influenza strain as a notifiable disease yesterday, one day after four more cases of the bird-flu virus new to humans were reported in China. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities later yesterday reported that two more people had contracted the new bird flu, one of whom has died, bringing the total number of known cases to nine and the number of deaths to three. “We have decided to list H7N9 infection as a category five notifiable disease,” Department of Health Minister Chiu Wen-ta (邱文達) said after hosting a meeting with disease control experts. The department has also decided to raise the quarantine alert for the H7N9 flu strain from Grade 2 to Grade 3, Chiu said. Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday that three women and a man, from various cities in Jiangsu Province, have fallen critically ill from the H7N9 virus. The cases were the second batch to be confirmed in China after three in Shanghai and in Anhui Province on Sunday. Chinese authorities reported yesterday that a 38-year-old cook became ill early last month while working in Jiangsu Province. Xinhua said no connection between the two cases had been discovered and no one in close contact with either patient had developed any flu-like symptoms. The Chinese news Web site Chinanews.com said the four patients in Jiangsu all reported varying symptoms of dizziness, fever, coughing and breathlessness. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture said it had yet to find any animals infected with the H7N9 virus, but added it was possible that H7N9 had been brought to China by migratory birds. In Taipei yesterday, Council of Agriculture Deputy Minister Wang Cheng-teng (王政騰) said tourists from China have been barred from visiting poultry farms nationwide over concerns about avian influenza. Huang Kuo-ching (黃國青), deputy head of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said the bureau has advised poultry farm operators to reject visits by Chinese tourists. On Tuesday, when commenting on Taiwan’s ability to cope with a possible threat from the disease, Steve Chan (詹啟賢), chairman of the Taichung-based Adimmune Corp (國光生技), said that although there is no specific vaccine for H7N9 — a new variant — it is a “sibling” of the more commonly seen H5N1 virus, for which a vaccine already exists. \"The precursor of the H5N1 influenza virus that spread to humans in 1997 was first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996, when it caused a moderate number of deaths in geese and attracted very little attention.\" In 1997, in Hong Kong, 18 humans were infected and 6 died in the first known case of H5N1 infecting humans.

The 5-week-old boy was hospitalized Saturday at St. John’s Hospital in Springfield and was reported to be in critical condition after his mother observed that he was experiencing difficulty breathing and took him to Mercy Medical Center. He reportedly told investigators that he shook his son because the baby was crying. Although treatment for shaken baby syndrome varies depending on the specific situation and other factors, including the age of the child and the extent and type of injuries involved, some of the immediate treatments are relatively common among shaken baby syndrome victims. An infant or child who has been shaken should be taken and admitted to a hospital as soon as possible, where doctors will closely observe, monitor, and treat the baby. If physicians see signs of brain swelling and breathing problems, they will send the baby to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory support (in the form of oxygen therapy or a ventilator), since such problems may lead to a stroke or dead brain cells. Sometimes a shaken baby may need to undergo surgery to treat brain swelling and internal bleeding. In many instances, doctors may need to drain the blood around the brain to prevent future brain damage. Other injuries from the abuse are evaluated and treated, as well, such as broken bones, cuts, or seizures. The few treatments described here (not a comprehensive list) reveal just how serious shaken baby syndrome is.

A day care provider from Talbot County, Maryland, has been arrested in connection with the shaken baby death of a nine-month old boy she cared for in her home, according to the WBOC 16 news website. Police say that 911 received a call from Gail Dobson, 52, on September 2, who requested an ambulance and stated that the baby was experiencing difficulty breathing. Despite efforts from two hospitals, Little Trevor was pronounced dead at a children's hospital the next day. According to the autopsy, the child died of inflicted head trauma, an injury caused by shaken baby syndrome, and the death was ruled a homicide. Upon investigation and review of medical evidence, authorities determined that Trevor sustained his fatal injuries while under Dobson's care. Dobson was a licensed day care provider who only watched baby Trevor for two days, yet she allegedly inflicted trauma on the child's head, causing a fatal case of shaken baby syndrome.

One challenge in treating cancer is being able to deliver chemotherapy to the site of the tumor, avoiding general drug treatments that may affect healthy tissue. For some patients at Johns Hopkins, a polymer wafer is left behind after brain surgery. The Johns Hopkins Metastatic Brain Tumor Center coordinates care for patients with metastatic tumors to the brain (tumors that begin elsewhere but spread to the brain). Johns Hopkins scientists are conducting research in high-grade glioma patients to measure the blood levels of cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common virus that can cause severe disease in patients with weakened immune systems. Glioma patients can experience weakened immune systems as a result of therapies like radiation, chemotherapy and high-dose steroids used to treat their cancer. Ultimately, the Johns Hopkins investigators hope to determine whether high-grade glioma patients should be routinely screened for CMV and if antiviral medications or treatment may have an impact on outcomes. Brain cancer survivors should allow extra time to recover -- your body and brain need time to heal after treatment. Side effects of treatment may linger for months or years. Always discuss any health concerns and symptoms with your doctor. Brain tumor patients have difficulty with cognition for several reasons: the brain is taxed by the tumor, surgery, medications, radiation, and chemotherapy all in a short time. The Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Brain Tumor Center is one of the largest brain tumor treatment and research centers in the world. An estimated one in four deaths in 2014 can be attributed to cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. If you want to lead the fight against this disease, you can enroll as a medical student at one of the top schools recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many have top cancer hospitals as ranked by U.S. News & World Report and the oncology departments are in medical schools ranked among the best in the world. Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, offers oncology residency and fellowship programs through its Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. You can study alongside medical experts in various centers focusing on a host of cancers: bone marrow, brain, breast, colon, liver, lung, skin, pancreatic and prostate. It combines seven institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital, and more than 1,000 researchers. Oncology residents at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, can boast studying in the top-ranked medical school in the world, according to QS World Universities and the Academic Ranking of World Universities. The university oncology division is part of the internal medicine department and focuses on cellular biology, biochemistry and pathology, and the roles of surgery, radiology, immunology, neurology, psychology and sociology in cancer treatment. U.S. News ranks its hospital sixth in the nation for cancer and the best in the western United States. Oncology specialists at the University of California, San Francisco, are researching breast cancer, cancer and genetics, brain cancer, pediatric cancer, prostate cancer and tobacco control. Radiation oncology residents at UCSF can study gamma knife radiosurgery, intraoperative radiotherapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy, permanent brachytherapy, and intensity modulated radiotherapy. hospital endured its arduous dedication for its principle grounds of finding a cure for cancer.

Anadolu works with the John Hopkins Hospital which is ranked No. 3 among the best hospitals according to U.S. News & World Report. The Anadolu doctors provide radiosurgery with CyberKnife M6 and radiotherapy with TrueBeam Edge — radiation beams target cancer cells directly with accuracy to 0.5 mm not affecting healthy tissues. Sourasky is accredited by the FDA (Food and Drugs Administration) to provide highly sensitive medical tests. Dr. Goor has already helped about 87% of patients to beat blood cancer. At Medipol The Pediatric Hematology Unit works.

Teknon medical team cooperates with specialists of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York ranked top 2 cancer hospital according to the U.S. News & World Report’s rating. They participate in collaborative investigations and try innovative treatment methods for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. Bumrungrad International Hospital specialists provide their non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients with targeted therapy. The drugs prevent malignant cells from spreading around the body and reduce cancer symptoms. The doctors at Bumrungrad use a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy to stop lymphoma cells spreading throughout the body — it is easier to beat cancer with drugs in case a tumor is too large to be surgically removed. How to choose the best hospital for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma treatment? A medical center must have the latest equipment including PET-CT, MRI, and common treatment procedures, as stem cell transplant, radioimmunotherapy, targeted therapy etc. For example, Turkey has the lower prices than in Europe for cancer medical care due to the country’s economic policy, but its medicine is competitive with the most developed countries. Doctors calculate the cost of non-hodgkin's lymphoma treatment individually for each patient. The price depends on the disease type, complications (if any), hospital's reputation, and doctor's experience. According to the Focus Magazine, an authoritative publication writing about science and technologies, Helios is among top German hospitals. The hospital specialists provide high-dose therapies followed by stem cell transplant: autologous or allogeneic — as a way to achieve long-term success. The Rambam Hematology Research Center specialists have been studying and developing new treatment methods for all lymphoma types since 2015. Doctors then apply the most effective methods to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients. Sheba is the one of medical centers in Israel where doctors use gene therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma treatment. The medical center has advanced techniques, as cytogenetic profiles, MRI, CT, and PET-CT for detection and analysis of lymphoma. It helps to make a right diagnosis. The Pediatric Hemato-oncology Department at Sheba has successfully treated 12 cases with innovative CAR-T therapy. It's an infusion of genetically modified donor T-cells promoting fast immune reconstruction. Physicians take part in scientific advancement, developing of a new treatment regimen and innovative chemotherapy agents. Each patient is prescribed personalized care and medicines that takes into account person’s peculiarities. Almost 2 million patients come to Asklepios Barmbek for quality treatment each year.

They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\n During the first months of the pandemic in the country, several government officials were reported to have been tested for COVID-19 without complying with the initial triage algorithm used by the Department of Health (DOH), which restricted asymptomatic individuals from being tested. Some family and staff members were also reportedly tested for COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the Philippines had only tested 1,793 people due to the lack of testing kits. Public officials receiving quick results on their tests was perceived to be tantamount to receiving priority treatment as numerous people considered as actual patients under investigation – many of whom were front liners – were dying before their test results were out. In September 2020, with the improvement of testing capabilities and change in algorithm that focused on front liners and people who were in contact with COVID-infected patients, the government reported that over 3 million people had been tested. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results.

Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method.

Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\n During the first months of the pandemic in the country, several government officials were reported to have been tested for COVID-19 without complying with the initial triage algorithm used by the Department of Health (DOH), which restricted asymptomatic individuals from being tested. Some family and staff members were also reportedly tested for COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the Philippines had only tested 1,793 people due to the lack of testing kits. Public officials receiving quick results on their tests was perceived to be tantamount to receiving priority treatment as numerous people considered as actual patients under investigation – many of whom were front liners – were dying before their test results were out. In September 2020, with the improvement of testing capabilities and change in algorithm that focused on front liners and people who were in contact with COVID-infected patients, the government reported that over 3 million people had been tested. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports.

Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

Mental health issues are widespread among children, but many never receive adequate treatment. One political solution proposed to address this disparity would be to fund mental health services through school-based programs and support collaboration among community and health organizations to address the needs of children. A study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) found that access to care for mental health services for youth is limited. Of those diagnosed, roughly 36 percent with mental health disorders received further treatment through counseling, medication, therapy, or other assessments . This article reviews a particular policy reform effort that would expand support for school-based programs that offer children mental health services, making not only more services available to children in need but also more extensive and effective training for teachers and other professionals who work with them. Following the discussion of policy reform, this article will suggest interim mechanisms that public health advocates, including local stakeholders and health care professionals, can utilize to more effectively advocate for and support children’s mental health within their communities. Since its inception, the program has developed and utilized a collaborative model that shares resources with educational and health-related programs to increase services, awarding grants to more than 365 school districts in partnership with local agencies as of 2013 . Between 1999 and 2013, the SS/HS program has seen a 263 percent increase in the number of students receiving school-based mental health care . On March 25th, a letter of endorsement was sent to the bills’ sponsors with 36 signatures from national organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association . While the attempts have been unsuccessful to date, advocates for children’s mental health continue to recognize the immense impact that the Mental Health in Schools Act could have for the SS/HS program and other school-based health programs. Directing resources to school-based programs for children’s mental health provides services that are timely, accessible, and efficient and that reach the largest number of children possible . These barriers are augmented by social stigmas against mental health, which may discourage people from pursuing treatment . These partnerships can be formed with mental health service systems, social welfare services, or health care services, as well as individual physicians. However, given that the bill has not passed Congress, physicians should look to other methods outside of advocacy to proactively promote access to mental health assessments, therapy, and treatment, and to strengthen initiatives that are already in place. In 2005, the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) was developed to provide pediatricians with access to mental health specialists who help equip physicians with the skills necessary to effectively diagnose and treat mental health disorders.

One political solution proposed to address this disparity would be to fund mental health services through school-based programs and support collaboration among community and health organizations to address the needs of children. A study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) found that access to care for mental health services for youth is limited. Of those diagnosed, roughly 36 percent with mental health disorders received further treatment through counseling, medication, therapy, or other assessments . This article reviews a particular policy reform effort that would expand support for school-based programs that offer children mental health services, making not only more services available to children in need but also more extensive and effective training for teachers and other professionals who work with them. Following the discussion of policy reform, this article will suggest interim mechanisms that public health advocates, including local stakeholders and health care professionals, can utilize to more effectively advocate for and support children’s mental health within their communities. Since its inception, the program has developed and utilized a collaborative model that shares resources with educational and health-related programs to increase services, awarding grants to more than 365 school districts in partnership with local agencies as of 2013 . Between 1999 and 2013, the SS/HS program has seen a 263 percent increase in the number of students receiving school-based mental health care . On March 25th, a letter of endorsement was sent to the bills’ sponsors with 36 signatures from national organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association . While the attempts have been unsuccessful to date, advocates for children’s mental health continue to recognize the immense impact that the Mental Health in Schools Act could have for the SS/HS program and other school-based health programs. Directing resources to school-based programs for children’s mental health provides services that are timely, accessible, and efficient and that reach the largest number of children possible . These barriers are augmented by social stigmas against mental health, which may discourage people from pursuing treatment . These partnerships can be formed with mental health service systems, social welfare services, or health care services, as well as individual physicians. However, given that the bill has not passed Congress, physicians should look to other methods outside of advocacy to proactively promote access to mental health assessments, therapy, and treatment, and to strengthen initiatives that are already in place. In 2005, the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) was developed to provide pediatricians with access to mental health specialists who help equip physicians with the skills necessary to effectively diagnose and treat mental health disorders. Acts like these, along with advocacy for and implementation of legislation like the Mental Health in Schools Act, may go a long way in narrowing the disparities in access to mental health care for children. Community organizations, education systems, local governments, health care institutions, and other key parties should continue to advocate for policies such as the Mental Health in Schools Act that allocate resources necessary to address the problem but should also consider utilizing other mechanisms, such as the partnership described above.

At a fundraiser on September 9, Clinton stated: \"You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Donald Trump criticized Clinton's remark as insulting his supporters, and some political analysts compared the statement to Mitt Romney's 47% gaffe in 2012.

Savings were achieved by reducing hospital admissions and days, emergency department visits, home healthcare episodes, and days in skilled nursing facilities.

This study examined the effects of increased Cost sharing, implemented by many health plans to discourage use of expensive drugs and reduce drug spending. Doubling Co-payments was associated with significant reductions in use of 8 therapeutic classes—including a 25% decrease in the use of anti-diabetic medication. The authors raise concerns that reduction in use of medications for individuals with Chronic conditions will result in more costly health consequences.

This literature review was undertaken to understand the association betweenCost sharing features in drug Benefits and the use of prescription drugs, and/or use of non-pharmaceutical services and health outcomes. The studies show “increased Cost sharing is associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users and more frequent discontinuation of therapy.” For congestive heart failure, lipid disorders, diabetes and schizophrenia, higher cost burden on the patient for prescription medications was associated with greater utilization of expensive inpatient and emergency medical services. “Unintended Consequences of Caps on Medicare Drug Benefits,” New England Journal of Medicine. Although research showed a savings in drug costs, this reduction was offset by an increase in costs associated with hospitalization and emergency department care. From 1996 to 2005, out-of-pocket spending among individuals using health services increased 39.4 percent per person, after adjusting for inflation. All insurance categories, including Medicaid recipients, had a sizable increase in out-of-pocket spending. The authors conclude that increases in Cost sharing for essential services and medications may lead to unintended consequences such as poor adherence to prescription drugs, which may lead to poor disease control. “The Effect of Consumer-Directed Health Plan on the Use of Preventive and Chronic Illness Services,”Health Affairs.

As employers face constant pressure to control health care costs, value-based insurance design has received much attention as a cost-savings device. This paper examines one value-based insurance design program and found that the program led to reduced use of nondrug health care services, offsetting the costs associated with additional use of drugs encouraged by the program. The findings suggest that value-based insurance design programs do not increase total system-wide medical spending.

This paper compares the effects of a large employer’s value-based insurance initiative that reduced copayments for five chronic medication classes as part of a disease management program with another employer who only used the disease management program.

This pharmacist intervention model was developed and implemented by Polk County, Florida, to engage patients with diabetes in managing their health based on the Asheville Project’s framework. The program was implemented in February 2005 with an onsite clinical pharmacist to counsel participants with diabetes. Measured outcomes included changes in HbA1c, blood glucose, and blood pressure values as well as utilization metrics, such as hospitalization and emergency room visit rates, from baseline to one year after pharmacist intervention. Results showed that an employer-based pharmacist intervention model for patients with diabetes improved HbA1c levels, reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, and decreased hospitalizations and emergency room visits after one year. The paper illustrates the need to balanced optimal policies on coverage and payments with what is politically acceptable to those covered, not only in the state but also nationwide. Adherence rates improved –increasing 3.8 percent for diabetic patients to 1.5 percent for those taking calcium-channel blockers—when compared to others whose employers did not offer a similar program.

From 1996 to 2005, out-of-pocket spending among individuals using health services increased 39.4 percent per person, after adjusting for inflation. All insurance categories, including Medicaid recipients, had a sizable increase in out-of-pocket spending. The authors conclude that increases in Cost sharing for essential services and medications may lead to unintended consequences such as poor adherence to prescription drugs, which may lead to poor disease control. “The Effect of Consumer-Directed Health Plan on the Use of Preventive and Chronic Illness Services,”Health Affairs.

As employers face constant pressure to control health care costs, value-based insurance design has received much attention as a cost-savings device. This paper examines one value-based insurance design program and found that the program led to reduced use of nondrug health care services, offsetting the costs associated with additional use of drugs encouraged by the program. The findings suggest that value-based insurance design programs do not increase total system-wide medical spending.

This paper compares the effects of a large employer’s value-based insurance initiative that reduced copayments for five chronic medication classes as part of a disease management program with another employer who only used the disease management program. Adherence to medications in the value-based intervention increased for four of the five medication classes and nonadherence declined by 7-14 percent. http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/26/2/w195.

This pharmacist intervention model was developed and implemented by Polk County, Florida, to engage patients with diabetes in managing their health based on the Asheville Project’s framework. The program was implemented in February 2005 with an onsite clinical pharmacist to counsel participants with diabetes. Measured outcomes included changes in HbA1c, blood glucose, and blood pressure values as well as utilization metrics, such as hospitalization and emergency room visit rates, from baseline to one year after pharmacist intervention. Results showed that an employer-based pharmacist intervention model for patients with diabetes improved HbA1c levels, reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, and decreased hospitalizations and emergency room visits after one year. The paper illustrates the need to balanced optimal policies on coverage and payments with what is politically acceptable to those covered, not only in the state but also nationwide. Adherence rates improved –increasing 3.8 percent for diabetic patients to 1.5 percent for those taking calcium-channel blockers—when compared to others whose employers did not offer a similar program. The authors conclude that despite these promising signs of VBID impact, longer-term adherence and trends in health care spending is still needed.

Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope.

However, there are major government programs that play a role in healthcare allocation. These programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities. It helps cover the cost of hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home healthcare services. Medicare recipients have access to a set of covered services, and the program sets guidelines on what services and procedures are reimbursed. Eligibility is determined based on various criteria, such as income level, household size, and disability status. It operates facilities that offer comprehensive medical care, including preventive services, primary care, and specialized care. The lack of transparency in healthcare pricing further complicates the rationing decisions. It is essential to note that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires hospitals receiving Medicare funds to provide emergency healthcare regardless of ability to pay or citizenship status. The government also regulates insurance policies, setting requirements for coverage and defining eligibility criteria. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, brought about significant changes, including the requirement for all Americans to purchase health insurance. Treatments that fall within a certain cost-effectiveness range are considered cost-effective and approved, while those above a certain threshold are rarely covered. Overall, healthcare rationing in the United States involves a complex interplay between market forces, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and insurance coverage decisions. \"Our team found that patients, especially older patients in community settings, received care that is different in important ways from what is recommended based on trials conducted in specialty research settings,\" said Dr. Katherine L. Kahn, professor of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Despite evidence from trials showing improved outcomes for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of age, only 50 percent of patients aged 75 and older received adjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast to recommendations that a course of adjuvant chemotherapy last six months, only two-thirds of patients were still receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at six months: 40 percent of older patients and 25 percent of younger patients had discontinued treatment by five months. Patients in the cancer study were drawn from three settings: five population-based areas in Alabama, Iowa, Los Angeles County, Northern California and North Carolina; five integrated health care systems; and 15 Veterans Affairs hospitals. They were among the 10,061 patients and their caregivers who have taken part in the federally funded Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study of colorectal and lung cancer. RAND Health is the developer of COMPARE (Comprehensive Assessment of Reform Efforts), a one-of-a-kind online resource that provides objective analysis about national health care reform proposals. For this plan to work, every single American would have to take full advantage of the best medical care the country has to offer. If they were to do so, the country’s cancer mortality rate would fall by 22%, according to researchers from the American Cancer Society. It may sound like a pipe dream, but there’s evidence that it’s already happening thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law, better known as the ACA or Obamacare, has improved Americans’ access to healthcare in the states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. In the U.S., good healthcare often starts with good health insurance, and the ACA has provided a boost there too. In states that expanded Medicaid, the proportion of adults who lacked health insurance when they were first diagnosed with cancer fell from 9.6% in 2011 to 3.6% in 2014. Meanwhile, in states that did not expand Medicaid, the proportion fell only slightly, from 14.7% in 2011 to 13.3% in 2014. That ACA also allowed children to stay on their parents’ health insurance up to age 26, a provision that boosted insurance coverage among 19-to-25-year-olds by 7%. If all Americans got the same healthcare as college-educated Americans, the benefits would be far-reaching. For instance, the American Cancer Society epidemiologists determined that 59% of lung and bronchus cancers could be averted nationwide if everyone got the same care as people who went to college. Providing the highest quality care to all Americans would also eliminate 32% of deaths due to colorectal cancer, saving 8,952 lives per year, and 50% of cancers of the liver and bile duct, saving 8,433 lives per year. ObamaCare, also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), includes several provisions aimed at improving access to breast cancer prevention and treatment. These provisions are designed to provide quality treatment care and reduce financial stress for cancer patients. Improved health insurance coverage: ObamaCare ensures that access to health insurance must be approved or continued regardless of gender, age, or pre-existing conditions such as cancer. This means that women with breast cancer cannot be denied health insurance coverage because of their condition. Improved cancer detection coverage: ObamaCare provides cheaper or free (depending on age) screening and preventative services for breast cancer. Increased Medicare drug coverage: ObamaCare gradually narrows the Medicare Part D prescription coverage gap, also known as the \"donut hole,\" between now and 2020. This means that Medicare beneficiaries with breast cancer will have access to more affordable medications. Improved payment limits: Under ObamaCare, there are no longer lifetime limits on healthcare payments. This ensures that individuals with breast cancer can receive necessary treatments without worrying about reaching payment limits. It is important to note that these provisions are only a few examples of how ObamaCare aims to improve access to breast cancer prevention and treatment. The overall goal of the law is to increase the rate of health insurance coverage for American citizens and reduce the cost of healthcare.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

RAND Health is the developer of COMPARE (Comprehensive Assessment of Reform Efforts), a one-of-a-kind online resource that provides objective analysis about national health care reform proposals. For this plan to work, every single American would have to take full advantage of the best medical care the country has to offer. If they were to do so, the country’s cancer mortality rate would fall by 22%, according to researchers from the American Cancer Society. It may sound like a pipe dream, but there’s evidence that it’s already happening thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law, better known as the ACA or Obamacare, has improved Americans’ access to healthcare in the states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. In the U.S., good healthcare often starts with good health insurance, and the ACA has provided a boost there too. In states that expanded Medicaid, the proportion of adults who lacked health insurance when they were first diagnosed with cancer fell from 9.6% in 2011 to 3.6% in 2014. Meanwhile, in states that did not expand Medicaid, the proportion fell only slightly, from 14.7% in 2011 to 13.3% in 2014. That ACA also allowed children to stay on their parents’ health insurance up to age 26, a provision that boosted insurance coverage among 19-to-25-year-olds by 7%. If all Americans got the same healthcare as college-educated Americans, the benefits would be far-reaching. For instance, the American Cancer Society epidemiologists determined that 59% of lung and bronchus cancers could be averted nationwide if everyone got the same care as people who went to college. Providing the highest quality care to all Americans would also eliminate 32% of deaths due to colorectal cancer, saving 8,952 lives per year, and 50% of cancers of the liver and bile duct, saving 8,433 lives per year. ObamaCare, also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), includes several provisions aimed at improving access to breast cancer prevention and treatment. These provisions are designed to provide quality treatment care and reduce financial stress for cancer patients. Improved health insurance coverage: ObamaCare ensures that access to health insurance must be approved or continued regardless of gender, age, or pre-existing conditions such as cancer. This means that women with breast cancer cannot be denied health insurance coverage because of their condition. Improved cancer detection coverage: ObamaCare provides cheaper or free (depending on age) screening and preventative services for breast cancer. Increased Medicare drug coverage: ObamaCare gradually narrows the Medicare Part D prescription coverage gap, also known as the \"donut hole,\" between now and 2020. This means that Medicare beneficiaries with breast cancer will have access to more affordable medications. Improved payment limits: Under ObamaCare, there are no longer lifetime limits on healthcare payments. This ensures that individuals with breast cancer can receive necessary treatments without worrying about reaching payment limits. It is important to note that these provisions are only a few examples of how ObamaCare aims to improve access to breast cancer prevention and treatment. The overall goal of the law is to increase the rate of health insurance coverage for American citizens and reduce the cost of healthcare.\n\n"

As discussed below, exercise and caffeine consumption are known to help decrease the risks of acquisition. \"We wanted to investigate whether eating fish as a whole food would have a similar kind of effect as the omega 3 fatty acid supplements,\" said the study author, Dr. Sara Tedeschi, an associate physician of rheumatology, immunology and allergy at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Generally, the amount of omega 3 fatty acids in fish is lower than the doses that were given in the trials, she said. Even so, as the 176 study participants increased the amount of fish they ate weekly, their disease activity score lowered, the observational study found. The new study, which was heavily female, draws attention to the link between diet and arthritic disease, a New York City specialist said. Consumption of fish was counted if it was cooked -- broiled, steamed, or baked -- or raw, including sashimi and sushi. Almost 20 percent of participants ate fish less than once a month or never, while close to 18 percent consumed fish more than twice a week. The most frequent fish eaters reported less pain and swelling compared to those who ate fish less than once a month, the study found. Researchers can't prove that the fish was responsible for the improvements. And they theorized that those who regularly consumed fish could have a healthier lifestyle overall, contributing to their lower disease activity score. She acknowledged that fish tends to be an expensive food to purchase. \"If you can't for whatever reason, an omega 3 pill is a second option.\" Evidence from epidemiological, animal, and in vitro studies suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for Parkinson's disease. Rural living, well-drinking, and farming were also associated with Parkinson's, which may be partly explained by pesticide exposure. But studies into the association between diet and cancer show that food can have an impact in preventing cancer, or in reducing the aggressiveness of the disease. At the American Association for Cancer Research’s Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting in November 2006, investigators have found that eating fish regularly as an adult can help to protect against development of colon cancer. Men who ate fish five times a week or more had a 40 percent lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to men who ate fish less than once a week, according to a new analysis of data from 22,071 participants in the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS). The researchers say the reduction in colorectal cancer risk is substantial in comparison to other dietary components, and while they don’t suggest that everyone starts eating fish daily simply because of these results, they say the health benefits of fish consumption have already been proven. “We already know that eating fish can reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, and this might provide another reason to add fish to your diet,” said Megan Phillips, a doctoral student at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of this study. The researchers believe the health effects of fish consumption in relation to colorectal cancer may lie in their content of the omega-3 fatty acids that can inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Neptune krill oil is another important source of Omega-3 DHA and EPA. “We thought that maybe for men who received aspirin, it wouldn’t matter whether they ate fish or not,” Phillips said. The researchers looked at four different categories of fish consumed - tuna fish, dark meat fish (salmon, sardines, bluefish, etc. ), a general fish category, and shellfish including shrimp, lobster and scallops - and asked how many times the participants ate them on average during the previous year. They found almost 10 percent ate fish less than once a week, 31 percent ate it less than two times a week, 48 percent ate fish less than five times a week, and about 11 percent ate it five times or more a week. They found that compared to men who ate the least amount of fish, the risk of developing colorectal cancer was 40 percent lower in men who ate the most fish, was 20 percent lower in men who ate fish 2-5 times a week, and 13 percent lower among participants who ate fish less than two times a week. The relationship between fish consumption and colorectal cancer was similar for men randomized to aspirin and those who weren’t, possibly because the researchers only had information on aspirin use during the first five years in the trial, and “it may take more years of aspirin use to see an effect,” Phillips said. While she said the results are promising, Phillips also noted that they are based on the assumptions that the pattern of fish consumption observed in the sole food questionnaire represented a diet that the men subsequently followed for many years.

As evidence of this pressure, the U.S. government says the amount of cocaine seized on U.S. soil dropped by 41 percent between early 2007 and mid-2008. Since 2009, Vancouver, British Columbia became the main Mexican drug cartels' center of operations in Canada. However, the statements, findings, conclusions, views and opinions expressed in this report are exclusively those of the PMPRB and are not attributable to CIHI, IMS AG, or IMS Brogan. These targeted analyses are designed to inform policy discussions, aid in evidence-based decision making, and provide Canadians with a more comprehensive view of issues pertaining to pharmaceutical drug pricing and utilization in Canada and internationally. The report explores Canadian markets from the national and public and private payer perspectives, positioning them within an international context. Some of the analyses also include other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The growth in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs nearly doubled from 2010 to 2015. This increase was greater than in all of the PMPRB7 countries except for the US. Canada has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of biologic DMARDs compared to the PMPRB7 countries. The three top-selling biologic DMARDs in Canada, which accounted for over three quarters of the sales in 2015, had the highest average annual costs per patient. The Canadian market for biologic DMARDs is still dominated by the first few higher-cost entrants, despite competition from several subsequent market entrants with lower treatment costs. This price difference translates into $224 million in drug sales or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. While the price of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada is in line with the median OECD level, the uptake in sales has been relatively modest to date. If the use of the biosimilar in Canada had mirrored the median OECD use in 2015 (10.1%), it would have translated into a $41.7 million reduction in drug expenditures. Similarly, if the biosimilar uptake in Canada was in line with that of Norway (the country with the lowest biosimilar price and one of the highest uptakes at 67.8%), the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures, or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada. The amount spent on biologic drugs has markedly increased over the last two decades, putting considerable pressure on Canadian and international drug spending. It explores the cost implications for Canadians based on domestic and international markets and prices, and describes the drug portfolios of the manufacturers operating in this space. Some of the analysis is also extended to include additional countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Measures of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs are calculated for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign price. Bilateral price ratios compare the price levels for an individual country to prices available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides a detailed description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Canadian and international measures of per capita drug consumption are also reported. This database contains information on Canadian and international drug sales, list prices and utilization. Canadian and international sales and pricing information are based on manufacturer ex-factory prices. Foreign currencies are converted to Canadian dollars using the 12-month average exchange rate for the year indicated. This database houses pan-Canadian information on public drug programs, including anonymous claims-level data collected from the plans participating in the NPDUIS initiative: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Health Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) drug plan. This database houses anonymous claims-level data collected from a large sample of Canadian pay-direct private drug plans, capturing an estimated 85.7% of the national private payer market. This database reports on Canadian national and provincial drug sales at the pharmacy level, and provides information on the number of physical quantities, prescriptions and drug cost. Other data sources include Health Canada’s Drug Product Database, the European Medicines Agency’s orphan drug database, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Drug Review (CDR) reports, and the United Nations’ world population statistics. Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on manufacturer list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The list prices reported here may vary depending on the differences between the procurement processes in the retail and hospital sectors; procuring drugs through the hospital sector generally results in lower prices and greater efficiency. The totals for the Canadian public drug plans analyzed are heavily skewed by Ontario due to its size. Currently, there are nine drugs in this class available in Canada, which are described in Table 1.1. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluated all but two of the drugs (Enbrel and Kineret), and issued the same recommendation to Canada’s public drug plans: list with criteria or conditions. The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA), which was created in 2010 to achieve greater value for brand-name and generic drugs for publicly funded drug programs, has completed negotiations for three of the biologic DMARDs (for most indications)—Remicade, Orencia and Actemra. As of June 30, 2016, the pCPA was in ongoing negotiations for Simponi and Humira for ulcerative colitis (UC), while negotiations for Humira and Actemra for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) were being considered separately by each province/territory. ‡Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluation: LWCC, list with criteria or conditions. §Public plans in Canada do not provide unrestricted access to any of the biologic DMARDs. **pCPA, pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance. Negotiations can be undertaken collectively by the pCPA members or individually by the provinces. Compared to international markets, biologic DMARDs in Canada have one of the highest rates of growth in sales and have captured one of the highest market shares. Canada also has a relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs. While biologic DMARDs are a growing market segment in all of the countries included in this analysis, Canada has one of the highest rates of growth in sales. Over the last six years, sales in Canada have nearly doubled, from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $2.2 billion in 2015 (Figure 2.1), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. Over the last decade, the cumulative sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada reached $12.7B, accounting for 5.2% of the total $246.2B in sales in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada. Canada had a compound annual growth rate of 14.6%. †France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Canada, biologic DMARDs accounted for a sizable share of the total pharmaceutical market in 2015 (10.3%). In terms of utilization, Canada’s share of the international market for biologic DMARDs has also increased over time. In 2015, the Canadian market accounted for 6.3% of the total physical units of biologic DMARDs sold in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada, increasing from 4.9% over a six-year period. To examine the use of biologic DMARDs in more depth, an analysis of the foreign-to-Canadian per capita drug consumption is reported in Figure 2.3. The results are presented as an index, with the consumption rate in Canada set equal to one, and the rates in other countries determined relative to this measure. This bar graph compares the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian per capita consumption of biologic DMARDs for the PMPRB7 countries. The results are presented as an index with the Canadian rate of consumption set to a value of one. Each country is represented by a separate bar: France: 0.68 (32% less than Canada); Germany: 0.58 (42% less); Italy: 0.45 (55% less); Sweden: 1.03 (3% more); Switzerland: 0.83 (17% less); United Kingdom: 0.63 (37% less); United States: 1.00 (same as Canada). While Canada’s per capita rate of consumption of biologic DMARD treatments was comparable to that of Sweden and the United States, the rates were much lower in the remaining five PMPRB7 countries, ranging from 17% lower in Switzerland to 55% lower in Italy. Canada’s relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs increases the impact of foreign-to-Canadian price differentials and the availability of biosimilars in the Canadian market. Canada has the highest cost concentration of biologic DMARDs amongst the PMPRB7 countries, with three of the top-selling drugs in this class accounting for 79.5% of the Canadian sales. *France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Although most countries mainly dispense these drugs through the retail sector, Canada’s retail market share is particularly high (90% of the sales). While infusion drugs are generally provided through the hospital sector in most of the foreign markets, they are mainly dispensed through the retail sector in CanadaFootnote 3 and Germany (97% and 68% of Remicade infusions, respectively). While the sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada have nearly doubled (98% total growth) over the last six years, the increase has been mainly fueled by Remicade (41% of total) and Humira (29% of total) – see Figure 3.1. This series of graphs illustrates the trends in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs, by drug product from 2010 to 2015. In 2014, 42.0% of all prescribed drug spending in Canada was covered by public drug plans, with the remainder financed by private plans (35.8%) and out-of-pocket payers (22.2%)Footnote 4. Source: Payer Insight Database, January–December 2015, IMS Brogan. These drugs account for a smaller share of the private drug plan market (5.6% in 2015), although this share has also been increasing in recent years (from 3.6% in 2010).

While the Canadian prices for most biologic DMARDs are either in line with, or below, international levels, two of the four top-selling products, Remicade and Rituxan, have considerably lower foreign prices. Most notably, the median list price of Remicade was 25% lower in the PMPRB7 countries than in Canada. This price difference represents $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. This section reports the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign list prices. Bilateral price ratios compare the list price levels for an individual country to those available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the list prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides an in-depth description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Note that the list prices reported may vary across countries depending on whether the drugs are procured through the retail or hospital sectors. Figure 4.1 reports the bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for each of the PMPRB7 countries at the drug class level in 2015, along with the multilateral median foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and the OECD countries. The results are expressed as an index with the Canadian price for 2015 set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. The median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.89, suggesting that the median prices for biologic DMARDs in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 11% lower than in Canada. Similarly, the median OECD-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.78, indicating that the median prices in the OECD markets were, on average, 22% lower than in Canada. The bilateral results show that prices in four European markets are considerably below the Canadian level (France, Italy, Sweden and the UK). This bar graph gives the 2015 bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for each of the PMPRB7 countries, as well as the multilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median prices. Foreign prices are compared to the Canadian price level, which is set to one. France: 0.73; Germany: 1.12; Italy: 0.80; Sweden: 0.89; Switzerland: 1.13; United Kingdom: 0.77; United States: 1.78; PMPRB7 median: 0.89; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median: 0.78. While the Canadian prices of several biologic DMARDs are in line with international price levels, foreign markets have, on average, significantly lower prices for two of the four top-selling products: Remicade and Rituxan. Figure 4.2 reports the differences between foreign and Canadian list prices for the most common strength of each drug. The results are presented in the form of an index, with the Canadian price set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. For instance, the median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio for Remicade was 0.75 in 2015, suggesting that median prices in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 25% lower than in Canada. Similarly, the results indicate that the US price was 11% lower, and the median price in the OECD countries was 35% lower. Thus, all measures of foreign price analyzed indicate that Canada has the highest price for Remicade. The median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio for Rituxan was 0.84 in 2015, suggesting that median prices in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 16% lower than in Canada. This graph gives the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian price ratios by biologic DMARD for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The Canadian price (which is given in the table below the graph) is set to one and the international measures reported relative to this value. The median PMPRB7 price, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development price, and the average United States price are also reported. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median OECD cost and the average US treatment cost are also provided. As in the previous section, the results (based on list prices) indicate that Remicade had the highest estimated treatment cost in Canada compared to other countries and compared to other biologic DMARDs sold in Canada. If Canadians had paid the median list price of the PMPRB7 countries, based on the recommended doses, the average treatment cost for Remicade in Canada would have been $16.7K instead of $22.5K in 2015. Nonetheless, foreign markets have even lower prices. If Canadians had paid the median list price of the PMPRB7 countries, based on the recommended doses, the average treatment cost for Rituxan would have been $7.3K instead of $8.9K in 2015. This graph gives the 2015 annual treatment costs for biologic DMARDs for Canada, as well as the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development cost and the average United States treatment cost are also provided. Note: All prices are from IMS MIDAS™ data except for Actemra SC, which is based on l'Association québécoise des pharmaciens propriétaires (AQPP) prices. One point clearly emerges: not only is the list price of Remicade in Canada higher than in foreign markets, but the average annual treatment cost in Canada is greater than the median international costs of the alternative treatment options. An analysis of the international rates of consumption of biologic DMARDs suggests that Canada uses more of the higher-cost treatment options. Figure 4.4 compares the foreign and Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs based on the annual maintenance dose determined by the PMPRB HDAP and reported per one million inhabitants per year. The results suggest that the equivalent of 1,094 patients out of one million Canadians received a full annual treatment of Remicade, and another 1,018 patients received a full annual treatment of Humira. The Canadian rate of consumption of the two top-selling drugs is double that of other countries, with the PMPRB7 median consumption rates for Remicade and Humira being 495 and 598 annual doses per one million inhabitants, respectively. Canada also has a markedly higher consumption rate for Enbrel (455) than the PMPRB7 median (356). This graph compares the 2015 Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs to the rates in the PMPRB7 countries. The average Canadian, average United States and median PMPRB7 consumption rates are also given. The 25% price differential between foreign and Canadian list pricesFootnote 8 for Remicade reported in Figure 4.2 translates into $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Sources: Canadian national market: MIDAS™ Database, January–December 2015, IMS AG. Provincial public drug plans: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. A closer look at the recent trends shows a noticeable divergence in price between the Canadian and foreign markets over time. While Canadian prices have been slowly increasing at a rate lower than the rate of inflation, prices in the PMPRB7 countries (except in the US market) have been flat or declining (see Figure 4.5). This has resulted in a growing gap between Canadian and foreign prices. These two graphs give the trends in prices for biologic DMARDs in Canada and the PMPRB7 countries from 2011 to 2015. For example, from 2010 to 2015, the price of biologic DMARDs in Canada increased by 5%. Canada was the only country with a price growth other than the US, which had an unparalleled 65% price increase. By contrast, several countries, including Switzerland, France and Sweden, had marked price reductions over the same time period. Canada accounts for a sizable share of the international sales of biologic DMARDs, making it an important market from the standpoint of the manufacturers operating in this space. For several of these manufacturers, biologic DMARDs account for the bulk of their drug portfolios and represent a key driver of their sales growth in Canada. While Canada accounts for 2.5% of the total OECD pharmaceutical market, it represents an even larger share of the OECD market for biologic DMARDs at 4.0%, with Janssen Inc.’s sales of Remicade in Canada accounting for 8.5% of all OECD sales (see Table 5.1). Biologic DMARDs are the top-selling products for six of the seven manufacturers operating in this space: Janssen Inc.; AbbVie; Amgen Canada Inc.; Hoffmann-La Roche Limited; UCB Canada Inc.; and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Sobi. As Figure 5.1 suggests, biologic DMARDs account for an important share of their Canadian portfolio. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. For instance, several provinces spent around one tenth of their budget on Janssen Inc.’s drugs in 2015 (Figure 5.2). Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. While the price of the biosimilar for infliximab in Canada is in line with the median price level for the OECD countries, the uptake in sales has been modest. Although both drugs were approved for sale in Canada, 2015 sales data is only available for Inflectra. By comparison, the median biosimilar uptake in the OECD countries was 10.1% of the infliximab use in 2015, with 12 countries out of 24 having double-digit capture rates (highlighted in Table 6.1). Although this was one of the largest price differences between the biosimilar and the reference product among the OECD countries, the price of the biosimilar in Canada was actually slightly above the OECD median ($515). The large percent difference results from the list price of Remicade in Canada ($987), which was the highest among the markets analyzed. Following the biosimilar entry, the price of Remicade dropped, on average, by 6% in the OECD countries, while in Canada it remained virtually unchanged. Note: OECD countries not reported in the table have no sales information available for 2015. †Estimated based on data from the IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database. ‡No sales for Inflectra were available for Switzerland in 2015. The results are presented as an index, with the Canadian price for Remicade ($987) set to the value of one, and the international prices of this product and associated biosimilars determined relative to this value. While Canada has the highest price for Remicade amongst the OECD countries (with available data), the price of its biosimilar ($525) is generally lower than the available price levels in the PMPRB7 countries, and in line with the median OECD price level of $515 (as reported in Table 6.1). This bar graph illustrates the pricing of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada versus the PMPRB7 and select Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2015. The biosimilar price in Canada is $525. Despite the markedly lower price, the biosimilar market uptake has been modest in its first year of entry in Canada, estimated at 0.2% of the quantity of the molecule reimbursed by Canadian private drug plans in 2015 (Table 6.1). Table 6.2 explores the cost implications of the lower biosimilar capture rates in Canada (0.2%) compared to the median OECD levels (10.1%). The difference in uptake between the OECD median and Canada translates into an estimated $41.7 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 0.2% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Norway, for example, has both the lowest price for the infliximab biosimilars and one of the highest uptakes (67.8%). If the biosimilar uptake in Canada mirrored the uptake in Norway, the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada.

Public drug plan: This is a general term used to describe drug plans that are administered by provincial, territorial or federal governments. Examples include the public drug plans analyzed in this report. Private drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs accepted for reimbursement. How much more or less would Canadians have paid for the generic drugs they purchased in 2015 had they paid prices prevailing in country X? This report presents a variety of average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios, similar to those published in PMPRB’s Annual Report. These ratios are constructed as sales-weighted arithmetic averages of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios obtained at the level of individual drugs. The right-hand side of equation (G4) is the ratio of this hypothetical amount to the amount Canadians actually paid. A value of FTC < 1 thus indicates Canadians would have paid less in total for the drugs they purchased in the relevant period had they paid foreign prices instead of Canadian prices, while an FTC > 1 indicates they would have paid more.

Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. According to a 2017 poll, 32% of Canadians—up from 30% in 2016—believed that too many refugees were coming to Canada. In 2018, an Angus Reid poll found that two-thirds (67%) of Canadians agreed that the situation of illegal immigration to Canada constitutes a \"crisis\" and that Canada's \"ability to handle the situation is at a limit.\" Six out of ten respondents also told the pollster that Canada is \"too generous\" towards would-be refugees, a spike of five percentage points since the question was asked the previous year.

The growth in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs nearly doubled from 2010 to 2015. This increase was greater than in all of the PMPRB7 countries except for the US. Canada has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of biologic DMARDs compared to the PMPRB7 countries.

Similarly, if the biosimilar uptake in Canada was in line with that of Norway (the country with the lowest biosimilar price and one of the highest uptakes at 67.8%), the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures, or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada. The amount spent on biologic drugs has markedly increased over the last two decades, putting considerable pressure on Canadian and international drug spending. It explores the cost implications for Canadians based on domestic and international markets and prices, and describes the drug portfolios of the manufacturers operating in this space. Some of the analysis is also extended to include additional countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Measures of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs are calculated for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign price. Bilateral price ratios compare the price levels for an individual country to prices available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides a detailed description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Canadian and international measures of per capita drug consumption are also reported. This database contains information on Canadian and international drug sales, list prices and utilization. Canadian and international sales and pricing information are based on manufacturer ex-factory prices. Foreign currencies are converted to Canadian dollars using the 12-month average exchange rate for the year indicated. This database houses pan-Canadian information on public drug programs, including anonymous claims-level data collected from the plans participating in the NPDUIS initiative: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Health Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) drug plan. This database houses anonymous claims-level data collected from a large sample of Canadian pay-direct private drug plans, capturing an estimated 85.7% of the national private payer market. This database reports on Canadian national and provincial drug sales at the pharmacy level, and provides information on the number of physical quantities, prescriptions and drug cost. Other data sources include Health Canada’s Drug Product Database, the European Medicines Agency’s orphan drug database, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Drug Review (CDR) reports, and the United Nations’ world population statistics. Foreign and Canadian national sales and prices are based on manufacturer list prices and do not capture off-invoice price rebates and allowances, managed entry agreements, or patient access schemes. The list prices reported here may vary depending on the differences between the procurement processes in the retail and hospital sectors; procuring drugs through the hospital sector generally results in lower prices and greater efficiency. The totals for the Canadian public drug plans analyzed are heavily skewed by Ontario due to its size. Currently, there are nine drugs in this class available in Canada, which are described in Table 1.1. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluated all but two of the drugs (Enbrel and Kineret), and issued the same recommendation to Canada’s public drug plans: list with criteria or conditions. The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA), which was created in 2010 to achieve greater value for brand-name and generic drugs for publicly funded drug programs, has completed negotiations for three of the biologic DMARDs (for most indications)—Remicade, Orencia and Actemra. As of June 30, 2016, the pCPA was in ongoing negotiations for Simponi and Humira for ulcerative colitis (UC), while negotiations for Humira and Actemra for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) were being considered separately by each province/territory. ‡Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Common Dug Review (CDR) evaluation: LWCC, list with criteria or conditions. §Public plans in Canada do not provide unrestricted access to any of the biologic DMARDs. **pCPA, pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance. Negotiations can be undertaken collectively by the pCPA members or individually by the provinces. Compared to international markets, biologic DMARDs in Canada have one of the highest rates of growth in sales and have captured one of the highest market shares. Canada also has a relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs. While biologic DMARDs are a growing market segment in all of the countries included in this analysis, Canada has one of the highest rates of growth in sales. Over the last six years, sales in Canada have nearly doubled, from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $2.2 billion in 2015 (Figure 2.1), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. Over the last decade, the cumulative sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada reached $12.7B, accounting for 5.2% of the total $246.2B in sales in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada. Canada had a compound annual growth rate of 14.6%. †France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Canada, biologic DMARDs accounted for a sizable share of the total pharmaceutical market in 2015 (10.3%). In terms of utilization, Canada’s share of the international market for biologic DMARDs has also increased over time. In 2015, the Canadian market accounted for 6.3% of the total physical units of biologic DMARDs sold in the PMPRB7 countries and Canada, increasing from 4.9% over a six-year period. To examine the use of biologic DMARDs in more depth, an analysis of the foreign-to-Canadian per capita drug consumption is reported in Figure 2.3. The results are presented as an index, with the consumption rate in Canada set equal to one, and the rates in other countries determined relative to this measure. This bar graph compares the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian per capita consumption of biologic DMARDs for the PMPRB7 countries. The results are presented as an index with the Canadian rate of consumption set to a value of one. Each country is represented by a separate bar: France: 0.68 (32% less than Canada); Germany: 0.58 (42% less); Italy: 0.45 (55% less); Sweden: 1.03 (3% more); Switzerland: 0.83 (17% less); United Kingdom: 0.63 (37% less); United States: 1.00 (same as Canada). While Canada’s per capita rate of consumption of biologic DMARD treatments was comparable to that of Sweden and the United States, the rates were much lower in the remaining five PMPRB7 countries, ranging from 17% lower in Switzerland to 55% lower in Italy. Canada’s relatively high per capita consumption rate of biologic DMARDs increases the impact of foreign-to-Canadian price differentials and the availability of biosimilars in the Canadian market. Canada has the highest cost concentration of biologic DMARDs amongst the PMPRB7 countries, with three of the top-selling drugs in this class accounting for 79.5% of the Canadian sales. *France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Although most countries mainly dispense these drugs through the retail sector, Canada’s retail market share is particularly high (90% of the sales). While infusion drugs are generally provided through the hospital sector in most of the foreign markets, they are mainly dispensed through the retail sector in CanadaFootnote 3 and Germany (97% and 68% of Remicade infusions, respectively). While the sales of biologic DMARDs in Canada have nearly doubled (98% total growth) over the last six years, the increase has been mainly fueled by Remicade (41% of total) and Humira (29% of total) – see Figure 3.1. This series of graphs illustrates the trends in Canadian sales of biologic DMARDs, by drug product from 2010 to 2015. In 2014, 42.0% of all prescribed drug spending in Canada was covered by public drug plans, with the remainder financed by private plans (35.8%) and out-of-pocket payers (22.2%)Footnote 4. Source: Payer Insight Database, January–December 2015, IMS Brogan. These drugs account for a smaller share of the private drug plan market (5.6% in 2015), although this share has also been increasing in recent years (from 3.6% in 2010).

While the Canadian prices for most biologic DMARDs are either in line with, or below, international levels, two of the four top-selling products, Remicade and Rituxan, have considerably lower foreign prices. Most notably, the median list price of Remicade was 25% lower in the PMPRB7 countries than in Canada. This price difference represents $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market. This section reports the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for a variety of bilateral and multilateral measures of foreign list prices. Bilateral price ratios compare the list price levels for an individual country to those available in Canada, while multilateral ratios compare the list prices across all countries analyzed to those available in Canada. Appendix B provides an in-depth description of how the average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios are calculated. Note that the list prices reported may vary across countries depending on whether the drugs are procured through the retail or hospital sectors. Figure 4.1 reports the bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for each of the PMPRB7 countries at the drug class level in 2015, along with the multilateral median foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and the OECD countries. The results are expressed as an index with the Canadian price for 2015 set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. The median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.89, suggesting that the median prices for biologic DMARDs in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 11% lower than in Canada. Similarly, the median OECD-to-Canadian price ratio was 0.78, indicating that the median prices in the OECD markets were, on average, 22% lower than in Canada. The bilateral results show that prices in four European markets are considerably below the Canadian level (France, Italy, Sweden and the UK). This bar graph gives the 2015 bilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for biologic DMARDs for each of the PMPRB7 countries, as well as the multilateral foreign-to-Canadian price ratios for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median prices. Foreign prices are compared to the Canadian price level, which is set to one. France: 0.73; Germany: 1.12; Italy: 0.80; Sweden: 0.89; Switzerland: 1.13; United Kingdom: 0.77; United States: 1.78; PMPRB7 median: 0.89; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development median: 0.78. While the Canadian prices of several biologic DMARDs are in line with international price levels, foreign markets have, on average, significantly lower prices for two of the four top-selling products: Remicade and Rituxan. Figure 4.2 reports the differences between foreign and Canadian list prices for the most common strength of each drug. The results are presented in the form of an index, with the Canadian price set to a value of one, and the international measures reported relative to this value. For instance, the median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio for Remicade was 0.75 in 2015, suggesting that median prices in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 25% lower than in Canada. Similarly, the results indicate that the US price was 11% lower, and the median price in the OECD countries was 35% lower. Thus, all measures of foreign price analyzed indicate that Canada has the highest price for Remicade. The median PMPRB7-to-Canadian price ratio for Rituxan was 0.84 in 2015, suggesting that median prices in the PMPRB7 markets were, on average, 16% lower than in Canada. This graph gives the 2015 foreign-to-Canadian price ratios by biologic DMARD for the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The Canadian price (which is given in the table below the graph) is set to one and the international measures reported relative to this value. The median PMPRB7 price, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development price, and the average United States price are also reported. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median OECD cost and the average US treatment cost are also provided. As in the previous section, the results (based on list prices) indicate that Remicade had the highest estimated treatment cost in Canada compared to other countries and compared to other biologic DMARDs sold in Canada. If Canadians had paid the median list price of the PMPRB7 countries, based on the recommended doses, the average treatment cost for Remicade in Canada would have been $16.7K instead of $22.5K in 2015. Nonetheless, foreign markets have even lower prices. If Canadians had paid the median list price of the PMPRB7 countries, based on the recommended doses, the average treatment cost for Rituxan would have been $7.3K instead of $8.9K in 2015. This graph gives the 2015 annual treatment costs for biologic DMARDs for Canada, as well as the PMPRB7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The average Canadian treatment cost, the median PMPRB7 cost, the median Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development cost and the average United States treatment cost are also provided. Note: All prices are from IMS MIDAS™ data except for Actemra SC, which is based on l'Association québécoise des pharmaciens propriétaires (AQPP) prices. One point clearly emerges: not only is the list price of Remicade in Canada higher than in foreign markets, but the average annual treatment cost in Canada is greater than the median international costs of the alternative treatment options. An analysis of the international rates of consumption of biologic DMARDs suggests that Canada uses more of the higher-cost treatment options. Figure 4.4 compares the foreign and Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs based on the annual maintenance dose determined by the PMPRB HDAP and reported per one million inhabitants per year. The results suggest that the equivalent of 1,094 patients out of one million Canadians received a full annual treatment of Remicade, and another 1,018 patients received a full annual treatment of Humira. The Canadian rate of consumption of the two top-selling drugs is double that of other countries, with the PMPRB7 median consumption rates for Remicade and Humira being 495 and 598 annual doses per one million inhabitants, respectively. Canada also has a markedly higher consumption rate for Enbrel (455) than the PMPRB7 median (356). This graph compares the 2015 Canadian consumption rates for biologic DMARDs to the rates in the PMPRB7 countries. The average Canadian, average United States and median PMPRB7 consumption rates are also given. The 25% price differential between foreign and Canadian list pricesFootnote 8 for Remicade reported in Figure 4.2 translates into $224 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 1.0% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year.

Provincial public drug plans: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. A closer look at the recent trends shows a noticeable divergence in price between the Canadian and foreign markets over time. While Canadian prices have been slowly increasing at a rate lower than the rate of inflation, prices in the PMPRB7 countries (except in the US market) have been flat or declining (see Figure 4.5). This has resulted in a growing gap between Canadian and foreign prices. These two graphs give the trends in prices for biologic DMARDs in Canada and the PMPRB7 countries from 2011 to 2015. For example, from 2010 to 2015, the price of biologic DMARDs in Canada increased by 5%. Canada was the only country with a price growth other than the US, which had an unparalleled 65% price increase. By contrast, several countries, including Switzerland, France and Sweden, had marked price reductions over the same time period. Canada accounts for a sizable share of the international sales of biologic DMARDs, making it an important market from the standpoint of the manufacturers operating in this space. For several of these manufacturers, biologic DMARDs account for the bulk of their drug portfolios and represent a key driver of their sales growth in Canada. While Canada accounts for 2.5% of the total OECD pharmaceutical market, it represents an even larger share of the OECD market for biologic DMARDs at 4.0%, with Janssen Inc.’s sales of Remicade in Canada accounting for 8.5% of all OECD sales (see Table 5.1). Biologic DMARDs are the top-selling products for six of the seven manufacturers operating in this space: Janssen Inc.; AbbVie; Amgen Canada Inc.; Hoffmann-La Roche Limited; UCB Canada Inc.; and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Sobi. As Figure 5.1 suggests, biologic DMARDs account for an important share of their Canadian portfolio. Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2010 to 2015. For instance, several provinces spent around one tenth of their budget on Janssen Inc.’s drugs in 2015 (Figure 5.2). Source: National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, Canadian Institute for Health Information, January–December 2015. While the price of the biosimilar for infliximab in Canada is in line with the median price level for the OECD countries, the uptake in sales has been modest. Although both drugs were approved for sale in Canada, 2015 sales data is only available for Inflectra. By comparison, the median biosimilar uptake in the OECD countries was 10.1% of the infliximab use in 2015, with 12 countries out of 24 having double-digit capture rates (highlighted in Table 6.1). Although this was one of the largest price differences between the biosimilar and the reference product among the OECD countries, the price of the biosimilar in Canada was actually slightly above the OECD median ($515). The large percent difference results from the list price of Remicade in Canada ($987), which was the highest among the markets analyzed. Following the biosimilar entry, the price of Remicade dropped, on average, by 6% in the OECD countries, while in Canada it remained virtually unchanged. Note: OECD countries not reported in the table have no sales information available for 2015. †Estimated based on data from the IMS Brogan Private Pay Direct Drug Plan Database. ‡No sales for Inflectra were available for Switzerland in 2015. The results are presented as an index, with the Canadian price for Remicade ($987) set to the value of one, and the international prices of this product and associated biosimilars determined relative to this value. While Canada has the highest price for Remicade amongst the OECD countries (with available data), the price of its biosimilar ($525) is generally lower than the available price levels in the PMPRB7 countries, and in line with the median OECD price level of $515 (as reported in Table 6.1). This bar graph illustrates the pricing of the biosimilar for Remicade in Canada versus the PMPRB7 and select Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2015. The biosimilar price in Canada is $525. Despite the markedly lower price, the biosimilar market uptake has been modest in its first year of entry in Canada, estimated at 0.2% of the quantity of the molecule reimbursed by Canadian private drug plans in 2015 (Table 6.1). Table 6.2 explores the cost implications of the lower biosimilar capture rates in Canada (0.2%) compared to the median OECD levels (10.1%). The difference in uptake between the OECD median and Canada translates into an estimated $41.7 million in drug sales in Canada in 2015 or 0.2% of the entire Canadian pharmaceutical market for that year. Norway, for example, has both the lowest price for the infliximab biosimilars and one of the highest uptakes (67.8%). If the biosimilar uptake in Canada mirrored the uptake in Norway, the cost implications would be substantial: a reduction of $280.1 million in drug expenditures or 1.3% of the entire pharmaceutical market in Canada.

Public drug plan: This is a general term used to describe drug plans that are administered by provincial, territorial or federal governments. Examples include the public drug plans analyzed in this report. Private drug plans establish eligibility requirements and cost sharing structures, as well as drugs accepted for reimbursement. How much more or less would Canadians have paid for the generic drugs they purchased in 2015 had they paid prices prevailing in country X? This report presents a variety of average foreign-to-Canadian price ratios, similar to those published in PMPRB’s Annual Report. These ratios are constructed as sales-weighted arithmetic averages of the foreign-to-Canadian price ratios obtained at the level of individual drugs. The right-hand side of equation (G4) is the ratio of this hypothetical amount to the amount Canadians actually paid. A value of FTC < 1 thus indicates Canadians would have paid less in total for the drugs they purchased in the relevant period had they paid foreign prices instead of Canadian prices, while an FTC > 1 indicates they would have paid more.

Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. According to a 2017 poll, 32% of Canadians—up from 30% in 2016—believed that too many refugees were coming to Canada. In 2018, an Angus Reid poll found that two-thirds (67%) of Canadians agreed that the situation of illegal immigration to Canada constitutes a \"crisis\" and that Canada's \"ability to handle the situation is at a limit.\" Six out of ten respondents also told the pollster that Canada is \"too generous\" towards would-be refugees, a spike of five percentage points since the question was asked the previous year. While it has authority over deceptive marketing across all goods and services, the Bureau has generally allowed the CFIA and Health Canada to enforce the Act with regard to food and drugs. The Bureau's guideline for Canadian-origin claims was 51% of domestic content, with the product's last substantial transformation in Canada. In July 2010, the Bureau brought in new guidelines drawing a distinction between \"Made in Canada\" and \"Product of Canada\", with the latter requiring 98% of the total direct costs to be domestic. Made in Canada claims required a qualifying statement for any imported materials, and the guidelines advised on the use of other terms and national symbols.\n\n"

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\n Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors\n\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:\n Prematurity\n High exposure to oxygen\n Low birth weight\n Various types of infections\n Cardiac defects\n Anaemia \n Low vitamin E level\n\nPathophysiology\n\nDuring development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.) This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina. Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (Respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, Intra ventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening. Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. Monitoring\n\nIn order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006. They included infants with birthweights under 1500 grams or under 30 weeks gestation in most cases. Furthermore, recent trials have shown that treatment at an earlier stage of the disease gives better results. Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes. Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. In others, only children treated for ROP are followed yearly. Follow up of premature children (with or without ROP) is varying among centers and countries, mirroring the diverse states of health care system in different countries. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children. ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants. There is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided. In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment. In 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world. This report contained three main findings: \n Premature birth has many different causes, and prevention is challenging,\n Prematurity is the most common cause of neonatal death in many countries, totaling as many as 1 million infants annually due to complications of preterm birth, and\n the number of preterm births is currently estimated to be 15 million, and increasing. History\n\nThis disease was first described in a premature baby in 1942. Between 1941–1953, over 12,000 babies worldwide were affected by it. Cases were then seen all over the world and the cause was, at that point, unknown. By 1951 a clear link between incidence and affluence became clear: many cases were seen in developed countries with organized and well-funded health care. Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted. Each case of ROP avoided by withholding oxygen \"may have cost some 16 deaths\". References\n\nExternal links\n\n Retinopathy of Prematurity Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI). Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors\n\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP.

Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes. Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. In others, only children treated for ROP are followed yearly. Follow up of premature children (with or without ROP) is varying among centers and countries, mirroring the diverse states of health care system in different countries. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children. ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants. There is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided. In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment. In 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world. This report contained three main findings: \n Premature birth has many different causes, and prevention is challenging,\n Prematurity is the most common cause of neonatal death in many countries, totaling as many as 1 million infants annually due to complications of preterm birth, and\n the number of preterm births is currently estimated to be 15 million, and increasing. History\n\nThis disease was first described in a premature baby in 1942. Between 1941–1953, over 12,000 babies worldwide were affected by it. Cases were then seen all over the world and the cause was, at that point, unknown. By 1951 a clear link between incidence and affluence became clear: many cases were seen in developed countries with organized and well-funded health care. Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted. Each case of ROP avoided by withholding oxygen \"may have cost some 16 deaths\". References\n\nExternal links\n\n Retinopathy of Prematurity Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI).

It creates a ring ofscar tissue and slows or stops the growth of these vessels, haltingthe progression of ROP. Study investigators examined 3862 premature infants whose low birth-weight put them at risk for ROP. However, 291 infants developed severe ROP and, after the informed consent of their parents was obtained, were entered into the cryotherapy study. The preliminary results concern 172 of these infants. All the premature infants enrolled in the CRYO-ROP Study were at least 28 days old, weighed less than 2.76 pounds at birth, had no other major eye or systemic abnormalities, and had ROP that had reached a threshold level of severity (“Stage 3 with plus’ disease” according to the International Classification ofRetinopathy of Prematurity) in at least on eye. Infants who had developed the threshold level of disease in only one eye were randomlyassigned to receive cryotherapy in that eye or no eye treatment. Ifthe second eye of the untreated babies developed threshold level ROP,then that eye was treated. Therefore, all infants with two eyeseligible for treatment had the opportunity to receive cryotherapy inone eye. Medical evaluation of all the babies in the CRYO-ROP study will continue and analyses of data on the long-term effects of cryotherapy for ROP will continue to be assessed over the next several years. Bothshort- and long-term evaluations of the treatment will provide valuable information about the natural course of ROP as well as about the visual prognosis of low birth-weight premature infants. An ROP epidemic occurred in the 1940s and early1950s when hospital nurseries began using excessively high levels ofoxygen in incubators to save the lives of premature infants. Theresults of that study influenced the way oxygen has been used in thecare of premature infant to the present day. However, as advances in neonatal care in the 1970s and 1980s enablethe survival of very low birth-weight babies (those under 3.3 pounds),a second ROP epidemic has developed despite superb technology thatregulates oxygen levels carefully. About the same number of infantslose their vision from ROP today as were blinded by the disease at theheight of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s. While the causes of ROPare still not fully understood, cryotherapy now offers an opportunityto improve the visual prospects of many premature infants who developROP.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

        "context": " Prevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\n Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors\n\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:\n Prematurity\n High exposure to oxygen\n Low birth weight\n Various types of infections\n Cardiac defects\n Anaemia \n Low vitamin E level\n\nPathophysiology\n\nDuring development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.) This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina. Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (Respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, Intra ventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening. Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. Monitoring\n\nIn order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006.

Bio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a product that was approved in February 2012 for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in conjunction with a medical condition like undescended testicles, chemotherapy side effects, or brain disorders. These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. Since then, numerous studies have backed up these findings. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking FDA-approved testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating the issue.

Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. Taken together, these factors increase the likelihood that Lyme-carrying ticks will encounter humans unfamiliar with their risk — a major concern, warns Jay Lemery, who oversees the wilderness and environmental section at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine. Lemery advised Utahns to learn to check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been in wooded or grassy areas, because tick bites are less likely to transmit diseases if the tick is removed quickly. Lemery said Utahns should be aware that ticks may be much smaller than they anticipate and will hide in skin folds or crevices. Peterson urged Utahns headed outdoors to wear protective clothing and insect repellent, which will deter both mosquitoes and ticks. Utahns should see their physician if they develop flulike symptoms, a fever or a rash after recreating outdoors. Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Tick-borne diseases, which afflict humans and other animals, are caused by infectious agents transmitted by tick bites. With summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. And new studies say global climate change may be increasing the range of disease-carrying ticks and the amount of time they are active. Both Riverside County and the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District do not look for ticks. “We actually discontinued routine tick collections/testing a few years ago to focus our resources on mosquito control and West Nile virus surveillance which is a much higher priority here in Southern California,” wrote Keith Jones, deputy director of the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health in an emailed response. “We always wrestle with that question: What risk do we have for Lyme disease for people who go hiking,” said Kelly Middleton, spokesperson for the Greater LA district. Orange County has a very low prevalence for Lyme disease. So the tick no longer has the ability to spread the disease, she said.

        "context": "Summit County is one of five counties in Utah that has had a report of Lyme disease. Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. Taken together, these factors increase the likelihood that Lyme-carrying ticks will encounter humans unfamiliar with their risk — a major concern, warns Jay Lemery, who oversees the wilderness and environmental section at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine. Lemery advised Utahns to learn to check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been in wooded or grassy areas, because tick bites are less likely to transmit diseases if the tick is removed quickly. Lemery said Utahns should be aware that ticks may be much smaller than they anticipate and will hide in skin folds or crevices. Peterson urged Utahns headed outdoors to wear protective clothing and insect repellent, which will deter both mosquitoes and ticks. Utahns should see their physician if they develop flulike symptoms, a fever or a rash after recreating outdoors.

August 20th 2012 – Everyone has been hearing the question Are cellphones dangerous, and everyone who has children prays that they are not. Unfortunately, radiation emanating from mobile phones (or cell phones) is a very real thing and something that little ones cannot escape from. One tends to think that the worst thing one can conceive simply cannot be true, but this escapism does not save one from adversity, when the effects of cellphone radiation begin to show up in the form of headaches, hyperactivity or inability to concentrate in children. Cell phones and health risk are not linked together idly; but that does not mean that cell phones and health risk have to coexist. There is some truth in the matter, for which reason stories of health toll, radiation sickness and the harm caused by EMF have been doing the rounds. And the book How To Protect Your Child From Cellphone Radiation gives exactly those answers that every parent has been looking for. Cell phones are a necessary evil. The only thing to do, then, is to protect children from the harmful effects of cellphone radiation. This book tells parents how they can protect their children without giving up on the convenience and utility of having a cell phone. Learn how one can possibly still acquiesce and buy the child the up-market, hip cell phone that he or she asks for, while being careful of their health and future risks. Mobile phone masts or towers are not the only dangers to health because of the radiation they emit but cellular phones may also pose danger to one’s health. The World Health Organi-sation (WHO) has classified mobile phone radiation on the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) scale into Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic. They get even more worried when the exposure is called radiation and comes from dangerous-looking high-voltage power lines controlled by government and industry, which some distrust deeply. Such exposure seems eerie when people hear that electromagnetic fields penetrate their homes, their bodies, their children. Congress responded with large direct appropriations for wider research on the effects of electromagnetic fields. After a large apparently positive study in Sweden,7 the Swedish government came close to mandating the relocation of schools to at least 1000 meters from large power lines. This whole saga began when two Denver researchers, puzzled by small clusters of cancer in children, came to believe that living in close proximity to high-voltage power lines was a cause of leukemia.4 The analysis they published in 1979 was crude and relied on distances from homes to power lines and on wiring configurations rather than on direct measures of exposure to electromagnetic fields. They found that the risk of childhood leukemia was more than doubled among children living near such power lines, a finding that led to more studies and more concern. The hypothesized cause was exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields generated by the electrical current in power lines. Although most physicists find it inconceivable that power-line electromagnetic fields could pose a hazard to health, dozens of epidemiologic studies have reported weak positive associations between proximity to high-voltage power lines and the risk of cancer.6,7 The negative or equivocal studies did not end the controversy. The report leaked last October by the mellitus National Council on Radiation Protection recommended a safety limit of 0.2 microteslas, a very weak field compared to those generated by household appliances. There is no way to block EMFs (they even penetrate lead shielding), and the only protection is distance from the source. Thousands of electric company substations are scattered throughout our cities large and small and they abut homes, apartments and office buildings — even schools. Checks showed the operators were exposed to more electromagnetic radiation than people who work on power lines or in power stations. Interestingly, these studies were funded in part by the Swedish utility industry. Maria Feychting of Swedens Karolinska Institute looked at 127,000 children who lived near big power lines for over 25 years and found twice the risk of leukemia. “In our study we found about a two-fold increase in the risk if the children were living close, within 50 meters (yards) of a big power line,” she told Britain’s Channel Four television. Even scientists who have failed to find a reason for the apparent link refuse to say it is safe to live near a high-voltage power line.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Such exposure seems eerie when people hear that electromagnetic fields penetrate their homes, their bodies, their children. Congress responded with large direct appropriations for wider research on the effects of electromagnetic fields. After a large apparently positive study in Sweden,7 the Swedish government came close to mandating the relocation of schools to at least 1000 meters from large power lines. This whole saga began when two Denver researchers, puzzled by small clusters of cancer in children, came to believe that living in close proximity to high-voltage power lines was a cause of leukemia.4 The analysis they published in 1979 was crude and relied on distances from homes to power lines and on wiring configurations rather than on direct measures of exposure to electromagnetic fields. They found that the risk of childhood leukemia was more than doubled among children living near such power lines, a finding that led to more studies and more concern. The hypothesized cause was exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields generated by the electrical current in power lines. Although most physicists find it inconceivable that power-line electromagnetic fields could pose a hazard to health, dozens of epidemiologic studies have reported weak positive associations between proximity to high-voltage power lines and the risk of cancer.6,7 The negative or equivocal studies did not end the controversy. The report leaked last October by the mellitus National Council on Radiation Protection recommended a safety limit of 0.2 microteslas, a very weak field compared to those generated by household appliances. There is no way to block EMFs (they even penetrate lead shielding), and the only protection is distance from the source. Thousands of electric company substations are scattered throughout our cities large and small and they abut homes, apartments and office buildings — even schools. Checks showed the operators were exposed to more electromagnetic radiation than people who work on power lines or in power stations. Interestingly, these studies were funded in part by the Swedish utility industry. Maria Feychting of Swedens Karolinska Institute looked at 127,000 children who lived near big power lines for over 25 years and found twice the risk of leukemia. “In our study we found about a two-fold increase in the risk if the children were living close, within 50 meters (yards) of a big power line,” she told Britain’s Channel Four television. Even scientists who have failed to find a reason for the apparent link refuse to say it is safe to live near a high-voltage power line.\n\n"

Founded in 1836 as \"Emory College\" by the Methodist Episcopal Church and named in honor of Methodist bishop John Emory, Emory is the second-oldest private institution of higher education in Georgia (after Mercer University, founded in 1833). Emory University has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology. Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. Emory University students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign countries. Emory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the state of Georgia and comprises seven major hospitals, including the Emory University Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown. Emory University is the leading coordinator of the U.S. Health Department's National Ebola Training and Education Center. Emory faculty and alumni include two Prime Ministers, nine university presidents, 11 members of the United States Congress, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a Vice President of the United States, a United States Speaker of the House, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include 21 Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Emmy Award winners, MacArthur Fellows, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, an Olympic gold medalist and Doug Demuro. History\n\nNineteenth century\nEmory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University School of Medicine, was founded. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war. Emory College, as with the entire Southeastern United States, struggled to overcome financial devastation during the Reconstruction Era. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. In 1915, Emory College relocated to Druid Hills and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts. Emory University organized a medical unit, composed of medical school faculty and medical alumni, that would be known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43. Emory Victory and served through World War II and in the Korean War. In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism. Women's and civil rights movements\nThe women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967. In 1971, Emory established one of the nation's first African-American studies programs and the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States. Emory's diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009. In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. Expansion and modernization\nThe course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. Twenty-first century\n\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December. Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's twenty-first president in August 2020. Academics\n\nAdmissions statistics\n\nEmory University is considered highly selective. In 2021, Emory University received 33,780 applications in which Emory College admitted 4,343 of first year undergraduate applicants, a 13% admission rate. Undergraduate schools\n\n Emory College of Arts and Sciences (1836)\nThe Emory College of Arts and Sciences offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) The Confucius Institute, a non-profit public institution affiliated with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, operates in co-operation with the university at the Emory College of Arts and Sciences. Emory University offers highly selective honors programs for high-performing undergraduates in most areas of concentration. Emory University offers a five-year dual degree program in engineering, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Emory University also offers a dual master's degree in social work with the University of Georgia. Students who successfully complete Oxford College advance to Emory College of Arts and Sciences to complete their undergraduate education. Graduate and professional schools\n\nEmory University School of Medicine (1854)\nThe Emory University School of Medicine offers the Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Master of Medical Science degrees. Emory University School of Law (1916)\nThe Emory University School of Law offers the Juris Doctor, Juris Master, Master of Laws, and Doctor of Juridical Science. Laney Graduate School (1919)\nThe Laney Graduate School offers the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Arts degrees. Emory University libraries include the Robert W. Woodruff Library, Woodruff Health Sciences Center Library, Hugh F. MacMillan and Yuddhishtir Modhwadia Law Library, James S. Guy Chemistry Library, Pitts Theology Library, Goizueta Business Library, Marian K. Heilbrun Music & Media Library, and the Stuart A. Rankings and reputation\n\nEmory University is ranked 21st among national universities in the United States and 71st among global universities by U.S. News & World Report, 98th among global universities and 19th in the United States in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2017–18. The Princeton Review named the Emory University School of Law as one of the best 169 law schools in the U.S. in 2014. In 2012, following an internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law Firm, Emory University announced that members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. Following the investigation, the individuals responsible for the misreportings were fired or resigned and the university issued a public apology. In 2015, Emory received $572.4 million from external funding agencies. Emory University has a strong partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. The Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University played a crucial role in ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research. Emory University research is heavily funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC). The university will collaborate with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response on the program, which will receive $12 million in funding over the next five years. In 2015, Emory received a three-year, $2.2 million grant from the CDC to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including Ebola, in health-care facilities. In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech were awarded an $8.3 million grant by the NIH to establish a National Exposure Assessment Laboratory. In 2015, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta were awarded a four-year, $1.8 million grant by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in order to expand the Atlanta Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development Program. In 2015, Emory University received a $15 million grant from the Wounded Warrior Project in order to establish the \"Warrior Care Network\" and develop innovative approaches to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Campuses\n\nEmory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia in 1836. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Emory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015. Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The campus is home to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. In 1991, Emory opened the first collegiate LGBT student center in the Southeastern United States which is the tenth oldest in the nation. Undergraduate dormitories include the Undergraduate Residential Center, Clairmont Residential Center, Tower Apartments, Alabama Hall, Complex, Dobbs Hall, Holmes Hall, Longstreet-Means Hall, Raoul Hall and Turman Hall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus. The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry curriculum. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina-based Duda Paine Architects. The new state-of-the-art building, dubbed the Emory Student Center (ESC), opened in May, 2019, and includes a larger dining hall, study and collaboration spaces, game room, a 1400+ person multipurpose space, coffee shop, food emporium. It is the first building on Emory's campus to receive a LEED platinum rating. Student life\n\nStudent body\nEmory University's total enrollment for fall 2019 was 15,398 students, with 8,101 undergraduates and 7,297 graduate and professional students. Emory routinely hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement. The center is named in honor of Emory alumnus Alben Barkley, 35th Vice President of the United States. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won 3 National Debate Tournaments and over 25 individual champion speaker awards. Community service\nThe university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella community service group. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club. Serving the Emory community since 1919, the Wheel is editorially and financially independent from the university. Greek life\nFraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's \"temple\" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play a part in leavening Emory's campus life. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students' concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Emory has a partnership with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period for \"Service for Learning\" which projects that Emory student volunteers participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well as restore neighborhood parks. Emory University also has many Black student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS). Emory has numerous club sports and a variety of recreational and competitive intramural teams. Athletics and traditions\nEmory ranks among top schools in both the U.S. News & World Report rankings of the best national universities and the Directors' Cup of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) for best all-around athletics program. Emory's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the Eagles, are members of the NCAA's Division III in the University Athletic Association (UAA). Notable alumni and faculty\n\nEmory University has over 13,200 faculty and staff members and over 133,000 living alumni. Awards and honors recognizing Emory alumni and faculty include the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Presidential Medal of Freedom, Bancroft Prize, Booker Prize, Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, National Humanities Medal, Peabody Award, Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, American Mathematical Society Fellowship, MacArthur Fellows Program, Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, American Society for Clinical Investigation, National Academy of Sciences, and National Research Council.

In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. Expansion and modernization\nThe course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. Twenty-first century\n\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December. Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's twenty-first president in August 2020. Academics\n\nAdmissions statistics\n\nEmory University is considered highly selective. In 2021, Emory University received 33,780 applications in which Emory College admitted 4,343 of first year undergraduate applicants, a 13% admission rate. Undergraduate schools\n\n Emory College of Arts and Sciences (1836)\nThe Emory College of Arts and Sciences offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) The Confucius Institute, a non-profit public institution affiliated with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, operates in co-operation with the university at the Emory College of Arts and Sciences. Emory University offers highly selective honors programs for high-performing undergraduates in most areas of concentration. Emory University offers a five-year dual degree program in engineering, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Emory University also offers a dual master's degree in social work with the University of Georgia. Students who successfully complete Oxford College advance to Emory College of Arts and Sciences to complete their undergraduate education. Graduate and professional schools\n\nEmory University School of Medicine (1854)\nThe Emory University School of Medicine offers the Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Master of Medical Science degrees. Emory University School of Law (1916)\nThe Emory University School of Law offers the Juris Doctor, Juris Master, Master of Laws, and Doctor of Juridical Science. Laney Graduate School (1919)\nThe Laney Graduate School offers the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Arts degrees. Emory University libraries include the Robert W. Woodruff Library, Woodruff Health Sciences Center Library, Hugh F. MacMillan and Yuddhishtir Modhwadia Law Library, James S. Guy Chemistry Library, Pitts Theology Library, Goizueta Business Library, Marian K. Heilbrun Music & Media Library, and the Stuart A. Rankings and reputation\n\nEmory University is ranked 21st among national universities in the United States and 71st among global universities by U.S. News & World Report, 98th among global universities and 19th in the United States in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2017–18. The Princeton Review named the Emory University School of Law as one of the best 169 law schools in the U.S. in 2014. In 2012, following an internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law Firm, Emory University announced that members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. Following the investigation, the individuals responsible for the misreportings were fired or resigned and the university issued a public apology. In 2015, Emory received $572.4 million from external funding agencies. Emory University has a strong partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. The Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University played a crucial role in ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research. Emory University research is heavily funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC). The university will collaborate with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response on the program, which will receive $12 million in funding over the next five years. In 2015, Emory received a three-year, $2.2 million grant from the CDC to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including Ebola, in health-care facilities. In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech were awarded an $8.3 million grant by the NIH to establish a National Exposure Assessment Laboratory. In 2015, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta were awarded a four-year, $1.8 million grant by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in order to expand the Atlanta Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development Program. In 2015, Emory University received a $15 million grant from the Wounded Warrior Project in order to establish the \"Warrior Care Network\" and develop innovative approaches to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Campuses\n\nEmory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia in 1836. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Emory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015. Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The campus is home to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. In 1991, Emory opened the first collegiate LGBT student center in the Southeastern United States which is the tenth oldest in the nation. Undergraduate dormitories include the Undergraduate Residential Center, Clairmont Residential Center, Tower Apartments, Alabama Hall, Complex, Dobbs Hall, Holmes Hall, Longstreet-Means Hall, Raoul Hall and Turman Hall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus. The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry curriculum. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina-based Duda Paine Architects. The new state-of-the-art building, dubbed the Emory Student Center (ESC), opened in May, 2019, and includes a larger dining hall, study and collaboration spaces, game room, a 1400+ person multipurpose space, coffee shop, food emporium. It is the first building on Emory's campus to receive a LEED platinum rating. Student life\n\nStudent body\nEmory University's total enrollment for fall 2019 was 15,398 students, with 8,101 undergraduates and 7,297 graduate and professional students. Emory routinely hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement. The center is named in honor of Emory alumnus Alben Barkley, 35th Vice President of the United States. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won 3 National Debate Tournaments and over 25 individual champion speaker awards. Community service\nThe university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella community service group. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club. Serving the Emory community since 1919, the Wheel is editorially and financially independent from the university. Greek life\nFraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's \"temple\" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play a part in leavening Emory's campus life. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students' concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Emory has a partnership with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period for \"Service for Learning\" which projects that Emory student volunteers participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well as restore neighborhood parks. Emory University also has many Black student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS). Emory has numerous club sports and a variety of recreational and competitive intramural teams. Athletics and traditions\nEmory ranks among top schools in both the U.S. News & World Report rankings of the best national universities and the Directors' Cup of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) for best all-around athletics program. Emory's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the Eagles, are members of the NCAA's Division III in the University Athletic Association (UAA). Notable alumni and faculty\n\nEmory University has over 13,200 faculty and staff members and over 133,000 living alumni. Awards and honors recognizing Emory alumni and faculty include the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Presidential Medal of Freedom, Bancroft Prize, Booker Prize, Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, National Humanities Medal, Peabody Award, Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, American Mathematical Society Fellowship, MacArthur Fellows Program, Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, American Society for Clinical Investigation, National Academy of Sciences, and National Research Council. Distinguished faculty: Jimmy Carter, 39th President of the United States; Sir Salman Rushdie, Booker Prize-winning novelist; Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama; Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize recipient; William Foege, tenth Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director; Nathan McCall, New York Times bestselling author; James T. Laney, 17th President of Emory University, United States Ambassador to Korea from 1993 to 1997; Natasha Trethewey, Pulitzer Prize winner; and US Poet Laureate and Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent.

The chapter said that the wall had been built for an annual \"capture the flag\" game and that the pro-Trump slogans were satirical and not in support of the candidate or his message. Some students protested that the wall was offensive and anti-immigrant or anti-Latino. The wall was later forcefully dismantled, allegedly in part by members of the Tulane football team.\n\n"

It is often associated with inflammation and has many potential causes, including an acute infection in the mother, exposure to environmental toxins, or chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The new test screens for 25 biomarkers of inflammation and immune system activation, as well as for levels of proteins that are important for placenta development. Combined with information on other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and income, the test can predict whether a woman is at risk for preterm birth with more than 80 percent accuracy. In the highest risk pregnancies—preterm births occurring before 32 weeks or in women with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure in the mother—the test predicted nearly 90 percent of cases. The researchers also wanted to be able to identify risk for preeclampsia, which is not included in current tests for preterm birth. The researchers first tested the samples for more than 60 different immune and growth factors, ultimately narrowing the test down to 25 factors that together could help predict risk for preterm birth. Researchers said the test could help prevent some cases of preterm birth. Based on a woman’s probability of preterm birth derived by the test, she could discuss with her clinician how best to follow-up and try to lower her risk. Some cases of preterm birth, including those caused by preeclampsia, can be prevented or delayed by taking aspirin, but treatment is most helpful if started before 16 weeks. Physicians could also evaluate high-risk women for underlying infections that may have gone undetected but could be treated. For others, close monitoring by their doctor could help flag early signs of labor like cervical shortening that can be staved off with progesterone treatment. A test for preterm birth is currently available, but it is expensive and only screens for spontaneous preterm birth, not for signs that could lead to indicated preterm births or for preeclampsia. What Health Risks Do Preemies Face? Most premature births result from spontaneous preterm labor -- and about half the time, the doctor can&apos;t determine the cause. Even if you do everything right, you may still deliver prematurely. If you&apos;re planning a pregnancy, see your doctor for a preconception checkup. She can identify health risks, such as STDs, that may contribute to preterm labor. If you&apos;ve delivered prematurely before, your doctor can inject you during pregnancy with progesterone, a hormone that might reduce your risk of having another early birth. Weight gain within this range significantly cuts risk of premature delivery. She may also perform a vaginal ultrasound to get a better look at your cervix and a vaginal swab to measure levels of fibronectin, a biological glue that helps attach the fetal sac to the uterine lining. If none is detected, you're unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. Fortunately, most women with possible signs of preterm labor go on to deliver at term. If tests show you're in preterm labor, your doctor may treat you with tocolytics, medicines that can postpone delivery. The delay is only a couple of days but gives you time to take a dose of corticosteroids, which speed development of your baby's lungs and reduce the risk of serious newborn complications. Medical testing and care can be performed in order to prevent intrauterine hypoxia, though can be difficult. These tests don't directly detect hypoxia, but instead detects the general well-being of the baby and ensures that the baby is healthy since hypoxia causes a wide range of responses. These tests can include prenatal testing, such as fetal movement and amniotic fluid levels, Doppler examination, or fetal heart rate. Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia. Studies have shown a connection between tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and hypoxia-ischemia brain injury, though further studies need to be done. Measuring fetal BH4 levels can be another way to look out for intrauterine hypoxia. During birth, birth asphyxia can occur in which cardiotocograph can be used to monitor the baby's health during labor. But sometimes delivery occurs sooner than expected. Strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all prenatal checkups. While the majority of premature births result from unexpected, spontaneous preterm labor (often following premature rupture of the membranes), 20 percent are early inductions due to pregnancy complications such as vaginal bleeding; uterine abnormalities; as well as health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. In such cases, early delivery may be the safest route for mother and baby. Because many of these conditions are often symptomless, they are difficult to prevent and diagnose in pregnancy. Women who smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs may also have a higher risk of delivering prematurely. Studies show that women have a higher risk if they are pregnant with multiples (twins or triplets), have had a previous preterm birth, or have certain uterine or cervical abnormalities. Unfortunately, there are additional inborn factors that may increase your risk of preterm labor. There are now treatments to help prevent preterm labor in certain high-risk women. Studies indicate that the hormone progesterone, when given in mid pregnancy, can decrease the rate of preterm delivery by 30 percent in women who have had a previous preterm birth. When present in late pregnancy (between 22 and 34 weeks), fibronectin may indicate the possibility of preterm delivery. These diagnostic tests can accurately determine which women with contractions are unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. This extra time can also enable your doctor to make arrangements for you to deliver in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit. Though these options can't completely prevent preterm birth, a group of drugs called tocolytics can now delay delivery for two to seven days. Tocolytics have been shown to be most effective when given early in labor. If you are less than 34 weeks pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with corticosteroids. These drugs work to speed the maturation of your baby's lungs and can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications and death. Corticosteriods are administered as maternal injections and have proven to be most effective when given at least 24 hours before delivery.

The grant, the largest single donation to Rush since its founding in 1837, will expand a Wounded Warrior Project-funded program that provides three weeks of concentrated post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, an approach that has been proven to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, symptoms. The Road Home Program was launched in 2014 to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, regardless of the ability to pay. As part of that effort, Wounded Warrior Project provided a $15 million grant for Rush to help support its treatment programs, including the development of a three-week Intensive Outpatient Program. The new funding will make the IOP available to more than 1,500 veterans over the next five years. In addition to the IOP expansion, the funding also will enable Road Home Program clinicians and therapists to provide outpatient therapy, counseling and other services to an additional 3,500 veterans and their family members from the Chicago area and elsewhere. Because spouses, children and other family members also are affected when their loved one experiences a trauma-based mental health issue, Road Home Program provides free services to family members. As many as one in three veterans who served in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have returned to the United States with what are called the “invisible wounds of war,” including PTSD, traumatic brain injury and related mental health conditions associated with their military service. “It is critical that the general health care system steps up to do its share to care for our servicemen and servicewomen, and their families, who have given so much for our country. This support and generosity from Wounded Warrior Project are enabling us at Rush to provide the leading-edge care and services that our warriors and their families so dearly earned,” said Mark Pollack, MD, professor and chairperson of the Rush Department of Psychiatry and founding director of the Road Home Program. The Road Home Program operates in a spirit of collaboration, connecting veterans to social services, education and vocational programming via local organizations. The center complements the many other important psychiatric and outreach services to veterans already offered by local Veterans Administration medical centers Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital; Jesse Brown VA Medical Center; and Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center. The care, provided at no cost to the veteran and their family, helps fill in the gaps in mental health care currently not provided by VA, or to those veterans who are not eligible or prefer to not receive care through the VA. Rush coordinates continuing care with the VA, working with a liaison so the veterans can continue to get treatment inside or outside of the VA.\nMore than 1,000 people have received care from the Road Home Program since it was established to help military veterans and their families make healthier transitions to civilian life by offering specialized mental health care, peer-to-peer outreach, counseling and community resource navigation. This care includes evidence-based treatment for PTSD, traumatic brain injury and military sexual trauma; child and family counseling; service and resource navigation; peer-to-peer outreach; public awareness programming; and training for primary care physicians and others. Our compassionate donors recognize every veteran returns home with their own unique experience and needs. With generous support from The Boeing Company, the Road Home Program began filling a critical gap in the local continuum of care for veterans, offering specialized assessment and treatment services for those struggling with moral injury. Since 2015 the Road Home Program Leadership Committee has raised funds and awareness in support of the center’s care for veterans and their families. Under the leadership of Gidwitz and fellow committee members, more than $4 million was raised through the annual Road Home Program Benefit. The service dogs help veterans connect better with civilian life by relieving anxiety and tension, while encouraging social interaction as a counter to the withdrawal that often goes hand-in-hand with PTSD. The initiative covers all costs for feeding, training and ongoing veterinary care for the dogs. Supporting veterans as they transition from service to civilian life has long been a key effort of BMO Harris Bank. The company has established specialized assistance for employees who served in the armed forces, while also maintaining a veteran’s advisory council and partnering with local veterans’ organizations across the country. Eligibility: VA may provide domiciliary care to veterans whose annual gross household income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of VA pension or to veterans who the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines have no adequate means of support. The Domiciliary Care Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs provides residential rehabilitative and clinical care to veterans who have a wide range of problems, illnesses, or rehabilitative care needs which can be medical, psychiatric, substance use, homelessness, vocational, educational, or social. The VA Domiciliary Care Program also provides rehabilitative care for homeless veterans. The CLC provides a variety of health care programs for Veterans: long-term care, short-term rehabilitation therapy, respite care, and palliative care. The program is staffed by a social worker, a geriatrician, and by professionals from the CLC. Veterans who are medically stable and free from disruptive behavior usually stay on respite care for 11 days at a time, not to exceed four weeks in any calendar year. We have both on-site respite in the CLC and in-home respite for patients who prefer that option. Eligible Veterans who require short-term rehabilitative care for recovery from acute events (surgery, stroke, acute illness) may receive this therapy at the CLC. The program is staffed by Geriatricians, physical and occupational therapists, and other health care professionals at the CLC. The clinics are staffed by Geriatricians, with input from social workers, pharmacists, or other professionals as needed. Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) provides at-home medical, nursing, social services, pharmacy, nutritional, psychological, and rehabilitative therapy for eligible Veterans whose disabilities prevent them from attending medical clinics for primary care. HBPC keeps disabled Veterans at home who otherwise might be institutionalized, thus improving quality of life for the patients. Eligible service-connected Veterans who require nursing home care may be placed - at VA expense - in community contract nursing homes (CNH). The program is administered by a full-time social worker and is monitored by the social work coordinator, nurses, and other extended care staff. Eligible Veterans usually are placed for 1 - 2 months, and on occasion for longer periods of time. The VHA has expanded its outreach efforts to include men and women veterans and homeless veterans. Several newer VA medical centers have been purposely located adjacent to medical schools. The VHA has initiatives in place to provide a \"seamless transition\" to newly discharged veterans transitioning from Department of Defense health care to VA care for conditions incurred in the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan.

Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. In a 6 year double blind placebo controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology\n\nMechanisms of action\n\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage.

Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. In a 6 year double blind placebo controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology\n\nMechanisms of action\n\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage.

Elgenoflex along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise and pain medications can help reduce moderate to severe pain of patients with osteoarthritis. Degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, etc. The vast majority of supplements to support joint, and connective tissue health contain glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), as well as their combinations, which are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials. Along with glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Elgenoflex also contains BioCell Collagen, which is a multifunctional, patented ingredient for joint, and vascular support. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and makes the supplement more effective for patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis. An abnormal immune response against the patient’s own collagen type II (cartilage collagen) is thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis in the knees and hands. After a pioneering study was published in 1993, a number of studies reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, short collagen fragments (as found in collagen hydrolysates such as BioCell Collagen used in Elgenoflex) reduce joint swelling and tenderness, and improve several other criteria used to assess the disease. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis, such as a reduction in pain and physical function impairment, and an improvement in performing daily activities, although it does not affect joint stiffness. CAN ELGENOFLEX BE BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment is aimed mainly at preventing joint damage and alleviating symptoms. One of the auto antigens thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis is cartilage collagen type II [3,4,5,6]. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of knee and hand osteoarthritis  and with osteoarthritis flares . Accordingly, a recent study of 3,582 osteoarthritis patients concluded that a fragment of collagen type II is the most informative biochemical marker for prediction of this disease. A number of studies have documented the beneficial effects of supplementation with collagen type II hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. After a pioneering study was published in 1993 in Science  , a number of studies have reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the exact origin of the supplement in this study was not specified, and it was unclear whether the collagen was hydrolyzed. A larger study (36 rheumatoid arthritis patients) found statistically significant improvements in the joint swelling score, Ritchie's index (a measure of joint tenderness), disease activity score, and Health Assessment Questionnaire score in patients given collagen tripeptides for three months in comparison with the placebo group, although no improvement in the subjective condition of the patients was found . Another pilot study (13 participants) assessed the effects of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well as uveitis associated with this condition . A much larger phase III clinical trial assessed the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in comparison with methotrexate, a drug that is approved for treatment of this disease . This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, which enrolled a total of 503 participants, used administration of 0.1 g of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate daily for 24 weeks. Using several variables to assess the effects of the treatments on the disease, the authors found that the collagen hydrolysate effectively alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Some of its effects were slightly weaker than the effects of methotrexate, but collagen hydrolysate also had fewer and milder side effects in comparison with methotrexate. These studies indicate that chicken type II collagen hydrolysate can be used as a supplement for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. Another randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . A more recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain involved 108 physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . A progressive loss of glycosaminoglycans is observed during the progression of osteoarthritis, and glycosaminoglycan content in cartilage tissue is used to grade the osteoarthritis stages . Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in bodily pain and social functioning were greater in the in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 60 patients who were asked to perform daily physical exercise found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (0.2 g daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of synovial fluid and cartilage, and is a component of a number of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, where it plays a variety of regulatory roles. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Whereas the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements, chondroitin is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug in European countries . Chondroitin is one of the most popular supplements used by osteoarthritis patients. The authors of a recent systematic meta-analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials, which lasted between one month and three years and involved a total of 9,110 participants (mainly with knee osteoarthritis, with fewer cases of hip or hand osteoarthritis), concluded that chondroitin significantly reduced the narrowing of minimum joint space . In studies shorter than six months, the authors also found that an index that takes into account pain, function, and disability showed statistically significant improvements in patients taking chondroitin in comparison with those taking a placebo. Curiously, this meta-analysis also found that chondroitin resulted in significantly fewer side effects than placebo . Although glucosamine is often used in combination with chondroitin sulfate, it is also effective alone. An example of a study that assessed long-term effects of glucosamine in patients with knee osteoarthritis is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Reginster and colleagues conducted in Belgium, Italy, and the UK, which was published in the highly respected British journal The Lancet . The authors found significant narrowing of the joint space in the placebo group but not in the glucosamine group. The WOMAC scores revealed some worsening of osteoarthritis symptoms in the placebo group but improvement in the glucosamine group . Despite a large number of clinical trials, the efficiency of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate is surrounded by controversy. This can be illustrated by the simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [31,32], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Finally, it should be noted that patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not benefit from glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements . Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis. For example, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, 50 patients with knee osteoarthritis received MSM (6 g daily) or a placebo for 12 weeks . Another 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that involved 118 patients with knee osteoarthritis found that MSM reduced pain in comparison with the placebo group . A more recent randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial enrolled 49 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received MSM (ca. Although Usha and Naidu  found pain reduction in patients taking MSM, this supplement alone was inferior to glucosamine, and a combination of MSM and glucosamine was more effective than each supplement individually. Similarly, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to act synergistically . These observations, together with the controversy regarding the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin, suggest that beneficial effects of each of these substances may be relatively small and noticeable only under certain circumstances or in certain groups of patients.

The former is characterized by short, deformed bones, enlarged joints, and pain in joints that restricts patients’ movement [3,4]. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains low-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) [13,14]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with knee osteoarthritis used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . An important study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial conducted by McAlindon and colleagues , who used sophisticated imaging technology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately measure short-term changes in knee hyaline cartilage in osteoarthritis patients taking collagen hydrolysate. Collagen type II hydrolysates are also effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For example, a phase III clinical trial (503 participants in total) compared the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate (0.1 g daily for 24 weeks) with those of methotrexate, an approved rheumatoid arthritis drug . The authors found that the collagen hydrolysate alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Thus, collagen type II hydrolysates have beneficial effects in healthy people with strenuous physical activity as well as patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in pain and social functioning were greater in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . Similar results were obtained in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted in Japan and enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of the synovial fluid and cartilage, and is widely used as a separate supplement in patients with osteoarthritis (see review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Despite a large number of clinical trials that used chondroitin sulfate, there has been a continuous controversy over the last decade regarding its efficiency . To address the latter issue, Monfort and colleagues have recently used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess pain in osteoarthritis patients taking chondroitin sulfate or a placebo for four months . In this phase IV, randomized, double-blind trial, the patients taking chondroitin sulfate but not those in the placebo group tended to report reduced subjective pain, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. These findings not only confirm the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate but also set a precedent for the use of a technique that may help resolve uncertainties in the efficacy of other supplements that are assumed to alleviate pain. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers chondroitin sulfate as a food supplement; in European countries, it is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug . Genet Med 5, 21-27 (2003).

Is chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine superior to placebo in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis covered in a separate article. A study conducted at Penn State University examined the effect of supplementation with a collagen type II hydrolysate on activity-related joint pain in 147 healthy athletes . The participants were taking either collagen hydrolysate (10 g daily) or a placebo for 24 weeks; joint pain was assessed by the participants in five different situations (like walking or lifting weight) and also by a physician. Another study that reported the ability of collagen hydrolysates to alleviate pain was conducted in Wisconsin (USA) and involved 20 patients with fibromyalgia; 12 of them also had pain in the temporomandibular joint . Some professional activities, such as farming, are also known to increase the risk of osteoarthritis . Out of three kinds of pain (at rest, on pressing, and on moving) in four joints (ankle, knee, hip and shoulder), pain on moving in the ankle was found to be the strongest and was thus chosen as a benchmark for the effect of the extract. Thus, glucosamine supplementation may have chondroprotective effects in athletes. A recent systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials that lasted for at least one year was aimed at identifying substances effective in preserving articular cartilage and delaying the development of knee osteoarthritis . The authors examined available data for 12 treatments, which included glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (other components of Elgenoflex, i.e. This study found that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were the only effective treatments to delay or prevent osteoarthritis progression. It should be noted that in this case the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were analyzed separately, whereas their effects are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [16,17]. Likewise, a combination of methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . Thus, supplements that contain several active ingredients, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be most efficient in alleviating pain and delaying the development of musculoskeletal disorders than supplements that contain only one or fewer ingredients.

Use of nutraceuticals in the management of osteoarthritis. Most of the available guidelines regarding the use of Elgenoflex components concern the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). This can be illustrated by simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [2,3], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin sulfate has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a placebo-controlled study conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) at 16 US universities and health centers, investigated the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (1500 mg and 1200 mg daily, respectively, for up to 24 weeks) in relieving pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis . The results of GAIT indicated that the glucosamine / chondroitin sulfate combination but not each supplement separately statistically significantly reduced pain in patients with moderate-to-severe pain in comparison with the placebo group. No significant improvement in pain was found in patients with mild pain. A later reanalysis of the data also suggested a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on knee joint swelling, particularly in patients with milder pain . On the basis of the GAIT results, the NIH guidelines recommend taking glucosamine plus chondroitin sulfate as a possible component of a comprehensive management plan (along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise, and pain medications) for osteoarthritis patients with moderate-to-severe pain . Despite these NIH guidelines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements and does not regulate them as medications. The FDA also considers that the link between glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate and a reduced risk of osteoarthritis has not been reliably established . The British National Health Service (NHS) considers chondroitin and glucosamine treatments not to be cost-effective enough in patients with osteoarthritis to warrant their prescription under the NHS scheme . However, the NHS guidelines issued in 2010 and reviewed in 2012, which are based on recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the UK Department of Health, recognize that glucosamine (1500 mg daily) is effective in mild or modest reduction of pain in some patients. The NHS guidelines also recommend patients who decide to take glucosamine to evaluate their pain before starting the supplement and after three months, to evaluate whether it is beneficial for them . Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are recognized as osteoarthritis drugs in some European countries . In France, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are considered drugs acting over long periods of time and are available as medications; after intense discussions on the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as symptomatic drugs for patients with osteoarthritis of the lower extremities, the French National Authority for Health (La Haute Autorité de santé — HAS) decided in 2008 to maintain their status, and medications that contain these substances (except one) continue to be partially reimbursed by the national social security system (Sécurité Sociale) . Similarly, the Association of Rheumatologists of Russia recommends prescribing chondroitin sulfate (500 mg twice daily over long periods of time) for patients with knee osteoarthritis and glucosamine sulfate (1500 mg daily for 4–12 weeks two or three times a year) for patients with knee and hand osteoarthritis . The guidelines of the OsteoArthritis Research Society International (OARSI) for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis  recognize the use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate for symptom relief as well as their possible “structure-modifying effects”. OARSI recommends that glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or their combination be taken for an initial period of six months and discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is apparent after this treatment. Similar to the NHS recommendations in the UK, in Denmark physicians starting treatment of a patient with osteoarthritis are advised to consider the use of glucosamine sulfate for a trial period of three months; if there is no improvement in symptoms after this period, NSAIDs are prescribed instead . Whereas most guidelines concern the management of knee osteoarthritis, the recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) on management of hand osteoarthritis note that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate “have a symptomatic effect and low toxicity, but effect sizes are small, [and] suitable patients are not well defined” . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that taking a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) but not placebo for 16 weeks resulted in moderate but significant improvements in parameters related to pain and walking function or going up and down the stairs, and also increased the ratio of collagen synthesis to its degradation . A more recent study, which was also double-blind and placebo-controlled, found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (200 mg daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . However, the above studies indicate that oral intake of hyaluronic acid at doses corresponding to one to four Elgenoflex pills would have beneficial effects at least in patients knee osteoarthritis. For example, in a recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . Although MSM is often included in commercial supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, it is inferior to glucosamine when used alone , and no clinical guidelines for its use as a separate supplement are available. However, when used in combination with glucosamine, MSM was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . A particularly strong placebo effect is observed in patients with osteoarthritis, especially with respect to alleviation of pain; this effect is usually larger than specific effects of available treatments [25,26,27]. None of the treatments, including celecoxib, showed statistically significant differences from the placebo (although celecoxib and glucosamine showed beneficial trends), but the placebo resulted in a graduate decline in the WOMAC score for pain, which plateaued at about 50% of the initial value in 6–7 months and remained at this level until the end of the study (i.e. As pain relief is one of the aims of any osteoarthritis treatment, it has been argued that the placebo effect may be effectively used for the benefits of the patients and should be taken into account when choosing the treatment . If the placebo effect is taken into account, the overall beneficial effect of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate becomes substantial . Finally, it is worth noting that the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [29,30]. Similarly, as mentioned above, methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine combined in the same supplement alleviate pain in osteoarthritis patients more effectively than each substance used alone .

The placebo effect and its determinants in osteoarthritis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Clinical efficacy and safety of glucosamine, chondroitin sulphate, their combination, celecoxib or placebo taken to treat osteoarthritis of the knee: 2-year results from GAIT. Various neutraceuticals (supplements) are available for equine joint health. Although these products are evaluated for safety, they are not required to prove efficacy, and actual scientific support of their benefits for osteoarthritis in horses are poor. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. In a 6 year double blind placebo controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology\n\nMechanisms of action\n\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage.

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250 mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200 mg capsules of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, two capsules of 250 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200 mg of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. It showed no difference from placebo. 2010 evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 people with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2 mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200 mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months.

Elgenoflex along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise and pain medications can help reduce moderate to severe pain of patients with osteoarthritis. Degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, etc. The vast majority of supplements to support joint, and connective tissue health contain glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), as well as their combinations, which are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials. Along with glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Elgenoflex also contains BioCell Collagen, which is a multifunctional, patented ingredient for joint, and vascular support. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and makes the supplement more effective for patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis. An abnormal immune response against the patient’s own collagen type II (cartilage collagen) is thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis in the knees and hands. After a pioneering study was published in 1993, a number of studies reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, short collagen fragments (as found in collagen hydrolysates such as BioCell Collagen used in Elgenoflex) reduce joint swelling and tenderness, and improve several other criteria used to assess the disease. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis, such as a reduction in pain and physical function impairment, and an improvement in performing daily activities, although it does not affect joint stiffness. CAN ELGENOFLEX BE BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. No definitive cure exists for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment is aimed mainly at preventing joint damage and alleviating symptoms. One of the auto antigens thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis is cartilage collagen type II [3,4,5,6]. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of knee and hand osteoarthritis  and with osteoarthritis flares . Accordingly, a recent study of 3,582 osteoarthritis patients concluded that a fragment of collagen type II is the most informative biochemical marker for prediction of this disease. A number of studies have documented the beneficial effects of supplementation with collagen type II hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. After a pioneering study was published in 1993 in Science  , a number of studies have reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the exact origin of the supplement in this study was not specified, and it was unclear whether the collagen was hydrolyzed. A larger study (36 rheumatoid arthritis patients) found statistically significant improvements in the joint swelling score, Ritchie's index (a measure of joint tenderness), disease activity score, and Health Assessment Questionnaire score in patients given collagen tripeptides for three months in comparison with the placebo group, although no improvement in the subjective condition of the patients was found . Another pilot study (13 participants) assessed the effects of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well as uveitis associated with this condition . A much larger phase III clinical trial assessed the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in comparison with methotrexate, a drug that is approved for treatment of this disease . This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, which enrolled a total of 503 participants, used administration of 0.1 g of chicken type II collagen hydrolysate daily for 24 weeks. Using several variables to assess the effects of the treatments on the disease, the authors found that the collagen hydrolysate effectively alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Some of its effects were slightly weaker than the effects of methotrexate, but collagen hydrolysate also had fewer and milder side effects in comparison with methotrexate. These studies indicate that chicken type II collagen hydrolysate can be used as a supplement for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. Another randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . A more recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain involved 108 physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . A progressive loss of glycosaminoglycans is observed during the progression of osteoarthritis, and glycosaminoglycan content in cartilage tissue is used to grade the osteoarthritis stages . Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in bodily pain and social functioning were greater in the in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 60 patients who were asked to perform daily physical exercise found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (0.2 g daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of synovial fluid and cartilage, and is a component of a number of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, where it plays a variety of regulatory roles. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Whereas the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements, chondroitin is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug in European countries . Chondroitin is one of the most popular supplements used by osteoarthritis patients. The authors of a recent systematic meta-analysis of 43 randomized controlled trials, which lasted between one month and three years and involved a total of 9,110 participants (mainly with knee osteoarthritis, with fewer cases of hip or hand osteoarthritis), concluded that chondroitin significantly reduced the narrowing of minimum joint space . In studies shorter than six months, the authors also found that an index that takes into account pain, function, and disability showed statistically significant improvements in patients taking chondroitin in comparison with those taking a placebo. Curiously, this meta-analysis also found that chondroitin resulted in significantly fewer side effects than placebo . Although glucosamine is often used in combination with chondroitin sulfate, it is also effective alone. An example of a study that assessed long-term effects of glucosamine in patients with knee osteoarthritis is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Reginster and colleagues conducted in Belgium, Italy, and the UK, which was published in the highly respected British journal The Lancet . The authors found significant narrowing of the joint space in the placebo group but not in the glucosamine group. The WOMAC scores revealed some worsening of osteoarthritis symptoms in the placebo group but improvement in the glucosamine group . Despite a large number of clinical trials, the efficiency of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate is surrounded by controversy. This can be illustrated by the simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [31,32], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Finally, it should be noted that patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not benefit from glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements . Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis. For example, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, 50 patients with knee osteoarthritis received MSM (6 g daily) or a placebo for 12 weeks . Another 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that involved 118 patients with knee osteoarthritis found that MSM reduced pain in comparison with the placebo group . A more recent randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial enrolled 49 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received MSM (ca. Although Usha and Naidu  found pain reduction in patients taking MSM, this supplement alone was inferior to glucosamine, and a combination of MSM and glucosamine was more effective than each supplement individually. Similarly, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to act synergistically . These observations, together with the controversy regarding the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin, suggest that beneficial effects of each of these substances may be relatively small and noticeable only under certain circumstances or in certain groups of patients.

The former is characterized by short, deformed bones, enlarged joints, and pain in joints that restricts patients’ movement [3,4]. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains low-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) [13,14]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 80 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and/or hip joints . No difference in tolerability was noted between BioCell Collagen and the placebo . These data suggest that formulations containing BioCell Collagen, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study that enrolled 250 patients with knee osteoarthritis used a similar collagen type II hydrolysate preparation (10 g daily for three months) . An important study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial conducted by McAlindon and colleagues , who used sophisticated imaging technology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately measure short-term changes in knee hyaline cartilage in osteoarthritis patients taking collagen hydrolysate. Collagen type II hydrolysates are also effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For example, a phase III clinical trial (503 participants in total) compared the effects of a chicken type II collagen hydrolysate (0.1 g daily for 24 weeks) with those of methotrexate, an approved rheumatoid arthritis drug . The authors found that the collagen hydrolysate alleviated rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Thus, collagen type II hydrolysates have beneficial effects in healthy people with strenuous physical activity as well as patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar changes were found in several markers of life quality: whereas both groups showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline, the improvements in pain and social functioning were greater in the hyaluronic acid group than in the placebo group . Similar results were obtained in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted in Japan and enrolled 43 patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) for 16 weeks . Similar to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is an important component of the synovial fluid and cartilage, and is widely used as a separate supplement in patients with osteoarthritis (see review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). Despite a large number of clinical trials that used chondroitin sulfate, there has been a continuous controversy over the last decade regarding its efficiency . To address the latter issue, Monfort and colleagues have recently used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess pain in osteoarthritis patients taking chondroitin sulfate or a placebo for four months . In this phase IV, randomized, double-blind trial, the patients taking chondroitin sulfate but not those in the placebo group tended to report reduced subjective pain, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. These findings not only confirm the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate but also set a precedent for the use of a technique that may help resolve uncertainties in the efficacy of other supplements that are assumed to alleviate pain. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) considers chondroitin sulfate as a food supplement; in European countries, it is recognized as an osteoarthritis drug . Genet Med 5, 21-27 (2003).

Is chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine superior to placebo in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis? The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis covered in a separate article. A study conducted at Penn State University examined the effect of supplementation with a collagen type II hydrolysate on activity-related joint pain in 147 healthy athletes . The participants were taking either collagen hydrolysate (10 g daily) or a placebo for 24 weeks; joint pain was assessed by the participants in five different situations (like walking or lifting weight) and also by a physician. Another study that reported the ability of collagen hydrolysates to alleviate pain was conducted in Wisconsin (USA) and involved 20 patients with fibromyalgia; 12 of them also had pain in the temporomandibular joint . Some professional activities, such as farming, are also known to increase the risk of osteoarthritis . Out of three kinds of pain (at rest, on pressing, and on moving) in four joints (ankle, knee, hip and shoulder), pain on moving in the ankle was found to be the strongest and was thus chosen as a benchmark for the effect of the extract. Thus, glucosamine supplementation may have chondroprotective effects in athletes. A recent systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials that lasted for at least one year was aimed at identifying substances effective in preserving articular cartilage and delaying the development of knee osteoarthritis . The authors examined available data for 12 treatments, which included glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (other components of Elgenoflex, i.e. This study found that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were the only effective treatments to delay or prevent osteoarthritis progression. It should be noted that in this case the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were analyzed separately, whereas their effects are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [16,17]. Likewise, a combination of methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . Thus, supplements that contain several active ingredients, such as Elgenoflex, can be expected to be most efficient in alleviating pain and delaying the development of musculoskeletal disorders than supplements that contain only one or fewer ingredients.

Use of nutraceuticals in the management of osteoarthritis. Most of the available guidelines regarding the use of Elgenoflex components concern the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as their combinations, are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials (see a review by Iovu and colleagues  and references therein). This can be illustrated by simultaneous publication in 2007 of reviews of available clinical trials by two different groups: a group from Belgium concluded that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in slowing the progression of osteoarthritis [2,3], whereas a group from Switzerland concluded that chondroitin sulfate has only minimal or no beneficial effects in osteoarthritis patients . Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a placebo-controlled study conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) at 16 US universities and health centers, investigated the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (1500 mg and 1200 mg daily, respectively, for up to 24 weeks) in relieving pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis . The results of GAIT indicated that the glucosamine / chondroitin sulfate combination but not each supplement separately statistically significantly reduced pain in patients with moderate-to-severe pain in comparison with the placebo group. No significant improvement in pain was found in patients with mild pain. A later reanalysis of the data also suggested a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on knee joint swelling, particularly in patients with milder pain . On the basis of the GAIT results, the NIH guidelines recommend taking glucosamine plus chondroitin sulfate as a possible component of a comprehensive management plan (along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise, and pain medications) for osteoarthritis patients with moderate-to-severe pain . Despite these NIH guidelines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as food supplements and does not regulate them as medications. The FDA also considers that the link between glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate and a reduced risk of osteoarthritis has not been reliably established . The British National Health Service (NHS) considers chondroitin and glucosamine treatments not to be cost-effective enough in patients with osteoarthritis to warrant their prescription under the NHS scheme . However, the NHS guidelines issued in 2010 and reviewed in 2012, which are based on recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the UK Department of Health, recognize that glucosamine (1500 mg daily) is effective in mild or modest reduction of pain in some patients. The NHS guidelines also recommend patients who decide to take glucosamine to evaluate their pain before starting the supplement and after three months, to evaluate whether it is beneficial for them . Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are recognized as osteoarthritis drugs in some European countries . In France, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are considered drugs acting over long periods of time and are available as medications; after intense discussions on the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as symptomatic drugs for patients with osteoarthritis of the lower extremities, the French National Authority for Health (La Haute Autorité de santé — HAS) decided in 2008 to maintain their status, and medications that contain these substances (except one) continue to be partially reimbursed by the national social security system (Sécurité Sociale) . Similarly, the Association of Rheumatologists of Russia recommends prescribing chondroitin sulfate (500 mg twice daily over long periods of time) for patients with knee osteoarthritis and glucosamine sulfate (1500 mg daily for 4–12 weeks two or three times a year) for patients with knee and hand osteoarthritis . The guidelines of the OsteoArthritis Research Society International (OARSI) for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis  recognize the use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate for symptom relief as well as their possible “structure-modifying effects”. OARSI recommends that glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or their combination be taken for an initial period of six months and discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is apparent after this treatment. Similar to the NHS recommendations in the UK, in Denmark physicians starting treatment of a patient with osteoarthritis are advised to consider the use of glucosamine sulfate for a trial period of three months; if there is no improvement in symptoms after this period, NSAIDs are prescribed instead . Whereas most guidelines concern the management of knee osteoarthritis, the recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) on management of hand osteoarthritis note that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate “have a symptomatic effect and low toxicity, but effect sizes are small, [and] suitable patients are not well defined” . A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that taking a chicken comb extract (equivalent to 60 mg of hyaluronic acid daily) but not placebo for 16 weeks resulted in moderate but significant improvements in parameters related to pain and walking function or going up and down the stairs, and also increased the ratio of collagen synthesis to its degradation . A more recent study, which was also double-blind and placebo-controlled, found that oral administration of hyaluronic acid (200 mg daily) for one year alleviated the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, especially in participants younger than 70 years of age . However, the above studies indicate that oral intake of hyaluronic acid at doses corresponding to one to four Elgenoflex pills would have beneficial effects at least in patients knee osteoarthritis. For example, in a recent phase IV multicenter trial conducted in Spain physically active patients with knee osteoarthritis received collagen hydrolysate and hyaluronic acid (7 g and 25 mg daily, respectively) for 90 days . Although MSM is often included in commercial supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, it is inferior to glucosamine when used alone , and no clinical guidelines for its use as a separate supplement are available. However, when used in combination with glucosamine, MSM was reported to be more effective in alleviating pain in osteoarthritis patients than each supplement individually . A particularly strong placebo effect is observed in patients with osteoarthritis, especially with respect to alleviation of pain; this effect is usually larger than specific effects of available treatments [25,26,27]. None of the treatments, including celecoxib, showed statistically significant differences from the placebo (although celecoxib and glucosamine showed beneficial trends), but the placebo resulted in a graduate decline in the WOMAC score for pain, which plateaued at about 50% of the initial value in 6–7 months and remained at this level until the end of the study (i.e. As pain relief is one of the aims of any osteoarthritis treatment, it has been argued that the placebo effect may be effectively used for the benefits of the patients and should be taken into account when choosing the treatment . If the placebo effect is taken into account, the overall beneficial effect of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate becomes substantial . Finally, it is worth noting that the effects of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are known to be synergistic when they are used as components of the same supplement [29,30]. Similarly, as mentioned above, methylsulfonylmethane and glucosamine combined in the same supplement alleviate pain in osteoarthritis patients more effectively than each substance used alone .

The placebo effect and its determinants in osteoarthritis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Clinical efficacy and safety of glucosamine, chondroitin sulphate, their combination, celecoxib or placebo taken to treat osteoarthritis of the knee: 2-year results from GAIT. Various neutraceuticals (supplements) are available for equine joint health. Although these products are evaluated for safety, they are not required to prove efficacy, and actual scientific support of their benefits for osteoarthritis in horses are poor. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. In a 6 year double blind placebo controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology\n\nMechanisms of action\n\nThe effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage. Physical and chemical properties\nChondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides: D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). \"Chondroitin sulfate B\" is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate. In 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified \"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\" as a contaminant in heparin originating from China. Clinical trials for osteoarthritis\n\nIn 2004, a petition was submitted to the FDA that a dietary supplement of chondroitin sulfate be labeled as reducing the risk of osteoarthritis, cartilage deterioration, and osteoarthritis-related joint pain, tenderness, and swelling. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.\" concluded that \"there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA.\" As of 2015 the largest trial conducted with the product was the Glucosamine and Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health in 1583 people with knee osteoarthritis, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250 mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200 mg capsules of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, two capsules of 250 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200 mg of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. It showed no difference from placebo. 2010 evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 people with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2 mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200 mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months. The primary outcome was a 20% reduction in pain over 24 months as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Society and culture\n\nManufacture\nMost chondroitin appears to be made from extracts of cartilaginous cow and pig tissues (cow trachea and pig ear and nose), but other sources such as shark, fish, and bird cartilage are also used. Since chondroitin is not a uniform substance, and is naturally present in a wide variety of forms, the precise composition of each supplement will vary. Legal status\nWhile it is a prescription or over-the-counter drug in 22 countries, chondroitin is regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration. In Europe, chondroitin sulfate formulations are approved as drugs with evidenced efficacy and safety demonstrated by clinical trials in people with osteoarthritis. reported in 2000 that of 32 chondroitin supplements they analysed, only 5 were labeled correctly, and more than half contained less than 40% of the labeled amount. United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) testing standards for the identification and quantification of chondroitin are well-established. There are no FDA regulations on chondroitin sulfate as a food additive, as it is recognized by the FDA as a component of food and is \"generally recognized as safe\". However, a proposed application of chondroitin sulfate dietary supplement as a means of preventing joint degeneration was highly scrutinized by the FDA, who stated:\n\nIn the same letter, the FDA found that studies performed on the dietary supplement form of chondroitin sulfate were insufficient to substantiate claims that it is efficacious in the prevention of joint deterioration, and denied the request to be allowed to label the supplement as such.

Since only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced in a partial knee replacement, the surgery is less invasive compared to a total knee replacement. Because a partial knee replacement involves a smaller incision and preserves healthy bone and cartilage in the rest of the knee, patients typically experience less pain after the procedure compared to a full knee replacement. Partial knee replacement also tends to involve less blood loss compared to a full knee replacement. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on an individual's specific condition and needs. Moreover, UKAs may require a smaller incision, less tissue damage, and faster recovery times. In the United States, the procedure constitutes approximately 8% of knee arthroplasties. In comparisons with a more extensive surgical procedure called high tibial osteotomy, UKA has equal or better outcomes. Background\nIn the early 1950s, Duncan C. McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint, and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected. Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement. Proper selection, following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA. Indications and contraindications\nUKA may be suitable for people with moderate joint disease caused by painful osteoarthritis or traumatic injury, a history of unsuccessful surgical procedures or poor bone density that precludes other types of knee surgery. The doctor may take some radiographs (e.g., x-rays) to check for degeneration of the other knee compartments and evaluate the knee. Surgical information\nThe surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject's knee. The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced. Benefits\nThe potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision. Another potential benefit is less post-operative pain because less bone is removed. Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma. In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:\n1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement\n2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances. By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge. Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include polyethylene wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment.

One of the primary objectives of the ACA is to improve the quality of health insurance by implementing essential health benefits, which ensure that coverage includes a set of essential services like preventive care, prescription drugs, and maternity care. Furthermore, the ACA aims to reduce healthcare costs for both individuals and the government. It includes provisions to control and lower healthcare spending, such as initiatives to promote preventive care, increase the use of electronic health records, and implement payment reforms. In conclusion, the main goals of the Affordable Care Act are to improve the quality and affordability of health insurance, expand insurance coverage, and reduce healthcare costs for individuals and the government. Through mechanisms like mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges, the ACA aims to achieve a more accessible and cost-effective healthcare system in the United States. This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the NHS. ; Underinsured or inefficient health insurance coverage. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act came into effect, which impacted the definition of medical indigence in the United States. Acts such as EMTALA ensure that every person coming into the emergency room must be treated regardless of insurance, with the patient left with the responsibility of paying the bill.

One of the primary objectives of the ACA is to improve the quality of health insurance by implementing essential health benefits, which ensure that coverage includes a set of essential services like preventive care, prescription drugs, and maternity care. Furthermore, the ACA aims to reduce healthcare costs for both individuals and the government. It includes provisions to control and lower healthcare spending, such as initiatives to promote preventive care, increase the use of electronic health records, and implement payment reforms. In conclusion, the main goals of the Affordable Care Act are to improve the quality and affordability of health insurance, expand insurance coverage, and reduce healthcare costs for individuals and the government. Through mechanisms like mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges, the ACA aims to achieve a more accessible and cost-effective healthcare system in the United States. This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the NHS. ; Underinsured or inefficient health insurance coverage. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act came into effect, which impacted the definition of medical indigence in the United States. Acts such as EMTALA ensure that every person coming into the emergency room must be treated regardless of insurance, with the patient left with the responsibility of paying the bill. The gap of not qualifying for insurance, as well as not being able to apply for insurance, leave these people in medical indigence.\n\n"

According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. This finding is similar to what is observed in heavy cocaine and heroin use. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of heavy marijuana use on the brain's dopamine system and to examine potential differences in effects based on frequency and duration of use. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support. However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. Participants from Oakland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Birmingham were repeatedly measured for pulmonary function, height, smoking behavior, and waist circumference and asked about cigarette and marijuana smoking during each assessment. “People who smoke marijuana inhale very deeply, which may strengthen the muscles used for inhalation – basically making them good at the test.

For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS. Most effective vaccines are whole-killed or live-attenuated organisms; killed HIV-1 does not retain antigenicity and the use of a live retrovirus vaccine raises safety issues. HIV structure\n\nThe epitopes of the viral envelope are more variable than those of many other viruses. The ineffectiveness of previously developed vaccines primarily stems from two related factors:\n First, HIV is highly mutable. Because of the virus's ability to rapidly respond to selective pressures imposed by the immune system, the population of virus in an infected individual typically evolves so that it can evade the two major arms of the adaptive immune system; humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (mediated by T cells) immunity. Second, HIV isolates are themselves highly variable. Therefore, the immune responses raised by any vaccine need to be broad enough to account for this variability. Any vaccine that lacks this breadth is unlikely to be effective. Another response to the challenge has been to create a single peptide that contains the least variable components of all the known HIV strains. However, the well-proven route of trying to induce neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has stalled because of the great difficulty in stimulating antibodies that neutralise heterologous primary HIV isolates. Some vaccines based on the virus envelope have protected chimpanzees or macaques from homologous virus challenge, but in clinical trials, humans who were immunised with similar constructs became infected after later exposure to HIV-1. There are some differences between SIV and HIV that may introduce challenges in the use of an animal model. There is a new animal model strongly resembling that of HIV in humans. Clinical trials\n\nSeveral vaccine candidates are in varying phases of clinical trials. Although the vaccination process involved many repeated \"booster\" injections, it was challenging to induce and maintain the high anti-gp120 antibody titers necessary to have any hope of neutralizing an HIV exposure. Those who received the vaccine regimen produced strong immune responses early on and the regimen was safe. Specifically, candidate vaccines that induce one or more of the following are being sought:\n neutralizing antibodies active against a broad range of HIV primary isolates;\n cytotoxic T cell responses in a vast majority of recipients;\n strong mucosal immune responses. In 2011, researchers in National Biotech Centre in Madrid unveiled data from the Phase I clinical trial of their new vaccine, MVA-B. The vaccine induced an immunological response in 92% of the healthy subjects. HIV used in the vaccine was chemically and physically deadened through radiation. The trial, conducted in Canada in 2012, demonstrated a good safety profile and elicited antibodies to HIV-1. According to Dr. Chil-Yong Kang of Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in Canada, the developer of this vaccine, antibodies against gp120 and p24 increased to 8-fold and 64-fold, respectively after vaccination. The trial was co-funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Merck developed V520 to stimulate HIV-specific cellular immunity, which prompts the body to produce T cells that kill HIV-infected cells. In previous smaller trials, this vaccine was found to be safe, because of the lack of adverse effects on the participants. The vaccine showed induced cellular immune responses against HIV in more than half of volunteers. Because the vaccine contains only three HIV genes housed in a weakened adenovirus, study participants cannot become infected with HIV or get a respiratory infection from the vaccine. It had been observed that a few, but not all, HIV-infected individuals naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies which keep the virus suppressed, and these people remain asymptomatic for decades. In 2017, Janssen and the HVTN launched the phase IIb trial called HVTN 705/Imbokodo, testing the mosaic vector vaccine Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 vaccines which are designed to prevent infection of all HIV subtypes around the world. In 2021 the NIH announced that the Imbokodo Phase 2b study did not provide statistically significant reduction in HIV infection. In 2019, Terevac-VIH, a vaccine from Cuba, was determined to have passed the first stage of clinical trials after two years and move to the second stage of development. It was tested in France in a double-blind Phase I/II trial with 48 HIV-positive patients who had reached viral suppression on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and then stopped antiretrovirals after getting the intradermal Tat Oyi vaccine. The study involved 16,395 participants who did not have HIV infection, 8197 of whom were given treatment consisting of two experimental vaccines targeting HIV types B and E that are prevalent in Thailand, while 8198 were given a placebo. After three years, the vaccine group had HIV infection rates reduced by about 30% compared with those in the placebo group. However, after taking into account the seven people who already had HIV before getting vaccinated (two in the placebo group, five in the vaccine group) the difference was 26%. Viruses collected from vaccinated participants had mutations in the V2 region. Tests of a vaccine for SIV in monkeys found greater resistance to SIV in animals producing antibodies against this region. Therefore, further research is expected to focus on creating vaccines designed to provoke an IgG reaction against the V2 loop. In 2020, the phase IIb-III trial /\"Uhambo\" found that ALVAC/gp120/MF59 vaccinations were safe, and caused no harm, but had no efficacy in HIV prevention in South Africa. The regimen is a combination of an adenovirus vector vaccine engineered against multiple global strains of HIV, and a protein vaccine. Economics\nA July 2012 report of the HIV Vaccines & Microbicides Resource Tracking Working Group estimates that $845 million was invested in HIV vaccine research in 2011. Classification of possible vaccines\nTheoretically, any possible HIV vaccine must inhibit or stop the HIV virion replication cycle. Live attenuated vaccines are highly successful against polio, rotavirus and measles, but have not been tested against HIV in humans. Reversion to live virus has been a theoretical safety concern that has to date prevented clinical development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. Scientists are researching novel strategies to develop a non-virulent live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. For example, a genetically modified form of HIV has been created in which the virus's codons (a sequence of three nucleotides that form genetic code) are manipulated to rely on an unnatural amino acid for proper protein translation, which allows it to replicate. Because this amino acid is foreign to the human body, the virus cannot reproduce. Two active vaccine regimens, studied in the RV 144 and Imbokodo trials, showed they can prevent HIV in some individuals. For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS.

However, after taking into account the seven people who already had HIV before getting vaccinated (two in the placebo group, five in the vaccine group) the difference was 26%. Viruses collected from vaccinated participants had mutations in the V2 region. Tests of a vaccine for SIV in monkeys found greater resistance to SIV in animals producing antibodies against this region. Therefore, further research is expected to focus on creating vaccines designed to provoke an IgG reaction against the V2 loop. In 2020, the phase IIb-III trial /\"Uhambo\" found that ALVAC/gp120/MF59 vaccinations were safe, and caused no harm, but had no efficacy in HIV prevention in South Africa. The regimen is a combination of an adenovirus vector vaccine engineered against multiple global strains of HIV, and a protein vaccine. Economics\nA July 2012 report of the HIV Vaccines & Microbicides Resource Tracking Working Group estimates that $845 million was invested in HIV vaccine research in 2011. Classification of possible vaccines\nTheoretically, any possible HIV vaccine must inhibit or stop the HIV virion replication cycle. Live attenuated vaccines are highly successful against polio, rotavirus and measles, but have not been tested against HIV in humans. Reversion to live virus has been a theoretical safety concern that has to date prevented clinical development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. Scientists are researching novel strategies to develop a non-virulent live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. For example, a genetically modified form of HIV has been created in which the virus's codons (a sequence of three nucleotides that form genetic code) are manipulated to rely on an unnatural amino acid for proper protein translation, which allows it to replicate. Because this amino acid is foreign to the human body, the virus cannot reproduce. Two active vaccine regimens, studied in the RV 144 and Imbokodo trials, showed they can prevent HIV in some individuals. For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS. Most effective vaccines are whole-killed or live-attenuated organisms; killed HIV-1 does not retain antigenicity and the use of a live retrovirus vaccine raises safety issues. HIV structure\n\nThe epitopes of the viral envelope are more variable than those of many other viruses. The ineffectiveness of previously developed vaccines primarily stems from two related factors:\n First, HIV is highly mutable. Because of the virus's ability to rapidly respond to selective pressures imposed by the immune system, the population of virus in an infected individual typically evolves so that it can evade the two major arms of the adaptive immune system; humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (mediated by T cells) immunity. Second, HIV isolates are themselves highly variable. Therefore, the immune responses raised by any vaccine need to be broad enough to account for this variability. Any vaccine that lacks this breadth is unlikely to be effective. Another response to the challenge has been to create a single peptide that contains the least variable components of all the known HIV strains. However, the well-proven route of trying to induce neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has stalled because of the great difficulty in stimulating antibodies that neutralise heterologous primary HIV isolates. Some vaccines based on the virus envelope have protected chimpanzees or macaques from homologous virus challenge, but in clinical trials, humans who were immunised with similar constructs became infected after later exposure to HIV-1. There are some differences between SIV and HIV that may introduce challenges in the use of an animal model. There is a new animal model strongly resembling that of HIV in humans. Clinical trials\n\nSeveral vaccine candidates are in varying phases of clinical trials. Although the vaccination process involved many repeated \"booster\" injections, it was challenging to induce and maintain the high anti-gp120 antibody titers necessary to have any hope of neutralizing an HIV exposure. Those who received the vaccine regimen produced strong immune responses early on and the regimen was safe. Specifically, candidate vaccines that induce one or more of the following are being sought:\n neutralizing antibodies active against a broad range of HIV primary isolates;\n cytotoxic T cell responses in a vast majority of recipients;\n strong mucosal immune responses. In 2011, researchers in National Biotech Centre in Madrid unveiled data from the Phase I clinical trial of their new vaccine, MVA-B. The vaccine induced an immunological response in 92% of the healthy subjects. HIV used in the vaccine was chemically and physically deadened through radiation. The trial, conducted in Canada in 2012, demonstrated a good safety profile and elicited antibodies to HIV-1. According to Dr. Chil-Yong Kang of Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in Canada, the developer of this vaccine, antibodies against gp120 and p24 increased to 8-fold and 64-fold, respectively after vaccination. The trial was co-funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Merck developed V520 to stimulate HIV-specific cellular immunity, which prompts the body to produce T cells that kill HIV-infected cells. In previous smaller trials, this vaccine was found to be safe, because of the lack of adverse effects on the participants. The vaccine showed induced cellular immune responses against HIV in more than half of volunteers. Because the vaccine contains only three HIV genes housed in a weakened adenovirus, study participants cannot become infected with HIV or get a respiratory infection from the vaccine. It had been observed that a few, but not all, HIV-infected individuals naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies which keep the virus suppressed, and these people remain asymptomatic for decades. In 2017, Janssen and the HVTN launched the phase IIb trial called HVTN 705/Imbokodo, testing the mosaic vector vaccine Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 vaccines which are designed to prevent infection of all HIV subtypes around the world. In 2021 the NIH announced that the Imbokodo Phase 2b study did not provide statistically significant reduction in HIV infection. In 2019, Terevac-VIH, a vaccine from Cuba, was determined to have passed the first stage of clinical trials after two years and move to the second stage of development. It was tested in France in a double-blind Phase I/II trial with 48 HIV-positive patients who had reached viral suppression on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and then stopped antiretrovirals after getting the intradermal Tat Oyi vaccine.

Therefore, further research is expected to focus on creating vaccines designed to provoke an IgG reaction against the V2 loop. In 2020, the phase IIb-III trial /\"Uhambo\" found that ALVAC/gp120/MF59 vaccinations were safe, and caused no harm, but had no efficacy in HIV prevention in South Africa. The regimen is a combination of an adenovirus vector vaccine engineered against multiple global strains of HIV, and a protein vaccine. Economics\nA July 2012 report of the HIV Vaccines & Microbicides Resource Tracking Working Group estimates that $845 million was invested in HIV vaccine research in 2011. Classification of possible vaccines\nTheoretically, any possible HIV vaccine must inhibit or stop the HIV virion replication cycle. Live attenuated vaccines are highly successful against polio, rotavirus and measles, but have not been tested against HIV in humans. Reversion to live virus has been a theoretical safety concern that has to date prevented clinical development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. Scientists are researching novel strategies to develop a non-virulent live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. For example, a genetically modified form of HIV has been created in which the virus's codons (a sequence of three nucleotides that form genetic code) are manipulated to rely on an unnatural amino acid for proper protein translation, which allows it to replicate. Because this amino acid is foreign to the human body, the virus cannot reproduce. Two active vaccine regimens, studied in the RV 144 and Imbokodo trials, showed they can prevent HIV in some individuals. For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS. Most effective vaccines are whole-killed or live-attenuated organisms; killed HIV-1 does not retain antigenicity and the use of a live retrovirus vaccine raises safety issues. HIV structure\n\nThe epitopes of the viral envelope are more variable than those of many other viruses. The ineffectiveness of previously developed vaccines primarily stems from two related factors:\n First, HIV is highly mutable. Because of the virus's ability to rapidly respond to selective pressures imposed by the immune system, the population of virus in an infected individual typically evolves so that it can evade the two major arms of the adaptive immune system; humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (mediated by T cells) immunity. Second, HIV isolates are themselves highly variable. Therefore, the immune responses raised by any vaccine need to be broad enough to account for this variability. Any vaccine that lacks this breadth is unlikely to be effective. Another response to the challenge has been to create a single peptide that contains the least variable components of all the known HIV strains. However, the well-proven route of trying to induce neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has stalled because of the great difficulty in stimulating antibodies that neutralise heterologous primary HIV isolates. Some vaccines based on the virus envelope have protected chimpanzees or macaques from homologous virus challenge, but in clinical trials, humans who were immunised with similar constructs became infected after later exposure to HIV-1. There are some differences between SIV and HIV that may introduce challenges in the use of an animal model. There is a new animal model strongly resembling that of HIV in humans. Clinical trials\n\nSeveral vaccine candidates are in varying phases of clinical trials. Although the vaccination process involved many repeated \"booster\" injections, it was challenging to induce and maintain the high anti-gp120 antibody titers necessary to have any hope of neutralizing an HIV exposure. Those who received the vaccine regimen produced strong immune responses early on and the regimen was safe. Specifically, candidate vaccines that induce one or more of the following are being sought:\n neutralizing antibodies active against a broad range of HIV primary isolates;\n cytotoxic T cell responses in a vast majority of recipients;\n strong mucosal immune responses. In 2011, researchers in National Biotech Centre in Madrid unveiled data from the Phase I clinical trial of their new vaccine, MVA-B. The vaccine induced an immunological response in 92% of the healthy subjects. HIV used in the vaccine was chemically and physically deadened through radiation. The trial, conducted in Canada in 2012, demonstrated a good safety profile and elicited antibodies to HIV-1. According to Dr. Chil-Yong Kang of Western University's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in Canada, the developer of this vaccine, antibodies against gp120 and p24 increased to 8-fold and 64-fold, respectively after vaccination. The trial was co-funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Merck developed V520 to stimulate HIV-specific cellular immunity, which prompts the body to produce T cells that kill HIV-infected cells. In previous smaller trials, this vaccine was found to be safe, because of the lack of adverse effects on the participants. The vaccine showed induced cellular immune responses against HIV in more than half of volunteers. Because the vaccine contains only three HIV genes housed in a weakened adenovirus, study participants cannot become infected with HIV or get a respiratory infection from the vaccine. It had been observed that a few, but not all, HIV-infected individuals naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies which keep the virus suppressed, and these people remain asymptomatic for decades. In 2017, Janssen and the HVTN launched the phase IIb trial called HVTN 705/Imbokodo, testing the mosaic vector vaccine Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 vaccines which are designed to prevent infection of all HIV subtypes around the world. In 2021 the NIH announced that the Imbokodo Phase 2b study did not provide statistically significant reduction in HIV infection. In 2019, Terevac-VIH, a vaccine from Cuba, was determined to have passed the first stage of clinical trials after two years and move to the second stage of development. It was tested in France in a double-blind Phase I/II trial with 48 HIV-positive patients who had reached viral suppression on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and then stopped antiretrovirals after getting the intradermal Tat Oyi vaccine. The study involved 16,395 participants who did not have HIV infection, 8197 of whom were given treatment consisting of two experimental vaccines targeting HIV types B and E that are prevalent in Thailand, while 8198 were given a placebo. After three years, the vaccine group had HIV infection rates reduced by about 30% compared with those in the placebo group. However, after taking into account the seven people who already had HIV before getting vaccinated (two in the placebo group, five in the vaccine group) the difference was 26%. Viruses collected from vaccinated participants had mutations in the V2 region. Tests of a vaccine for SIV in monkeys found greater resistance to SIV in animals producing antibodies against this region.

An update on 3 August 2020 stated that four of the passengers who were on the two cruises had tested positive for the virus.\n\n"

A phase 3 SAMURAI trial of lasmiditan, a serotonin receptor agonist that targets 5-HT1F receptors without vasoconstriction, found the drug was effective and well tolerated for acute migraine among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The study found that significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (at 100 and 200 mg) were free from headache pain and such symptoms as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia at two hours after treating a migraine attack. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors, including those expressed at the trigeminal pathway, and it has been designed for the acute treatment of migraine without the vasoconstrictor activity associated with some migraine therapies, explained Kraig Kinchen, MD, senior medical director of migraine and related therapeutics at Eli Lilly and Company. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, Dr. Kinchen said. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published in Neurology on November 16, just two days after Eli Lilly announced its submission of lasmiditan to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. But they also noted that the drug did have other related side effects, which some patients may not find tolerable. The researchers, led by Bernice Kuca, BA, MS, head of clinical and regulatory operations at CoLucid, tracked 1,856 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura who had three to eight migraine attacks per month and moderate disability, as assessed by a Migraine Disability Assessment score greater than or equal to 11. In the 11-week study, the team randomized patients to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and asked patients to treat their next migraine attack within four hours of onset. He noted, “If I had a patient [who] was worried about cardiovascular risk, even if they tried triptans or not, they might gravitate towards this product. It also depends on the side effect profile.” For example, he said, patients may say they don't like paresthesia, and chest pain and neck discomfort [side effects of triptans], which might cause them to avoid triptan medications. “They may say, ‘I'll take my risk of 15- to 20-percent of dizziness,’” which is a side effect of lasmiditan. Nasim Maleki, PhD, a migraine researcher and assistant professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides a new alternative to a population that would otherwise heighten their risk of cardiovascular events with triptans.

These organizations believe that the womb is the \"most dangerous place for an African-American child.\" Similar to the views of Marcus Garvey, Black anti-abortionists view the abortion movement as an attack on the African American community as a form of genocide and a push for eugenics. Planned Parenthood and the actions of founder Margaret Sanger have become a focal point for these movements, believing their efforts continue to serve to harm Black women. Black women account for over 28% of abortions yearly, more than any other racial demographic. This statistic accounts for the reality that African American women also experience high unintended pregnancy rates, largely due to lack of access to comprehensive reproductive care, including birth control. African American anti-abortionist ideals threaten the access that Black women have gained to reproductive care, something that is harmful given the high rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs, including HIV, in the Black community. Planned Parenthood services over 360,000 Black women a year with not only safe abortion care, but also affordable contraceptives, breast cancer screenings, and STI detection and treatment. A Trump administration effort to shift family planning funding toward groups that may not provide comprehensive services and away from organizations that provide abortions could cripple other federal efforts to curb an explosion in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), some public health officials fear. The new rules, if adopted in their current form, would require that Title X services be physically and financially separate from abortion services. Title X funds have never been permitted to be used for abortions. But President Donald Trump and other Republicans have vowed to cut off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortions. Daltry and other public health experts are concerned that proposed changes to the Title X family planning program rules may result in the closing of some Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics that also provide abortion services. However, advocates of the Trump administration’s plan point out that some new clinics may also now get Title X funding. Dr. Anne Nolte, a family physician at St. Peter’s Gianna Center, a gynecology and infertility practice in New York City, said doctors at her practice don’t prescribe birth control pills or other FDA-approved methods of contraception. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing. The recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments. She will want to know if you are taking any medications and if you are under the care of another doctor, including a primary care physician or other medical professional like a therapist or psychiatrist.She will ask about tobacco, alcohol, and drug use—past and present.She will cover questions about allergies and childhood illnesses.How Planned Parenthood is funded has been a contentious issue in the United States for quite some time. The services that Planned Parenthood provides to women (and men) are largely preventive and diagnostic. They conduct STI/STD screenings, provide contraceptive advice as well as contraceptives, give pregnancy tests, give Pap tests (for cervical cancer screening), and provide abortions. The fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortions is the bone of contention over funding, particularly from the federal government. However, abortions make up a small percentage of the services they provide, and abortions cannot be paid for from the funding the organization receives from the federal government.

A Trump administration effort to shift family planning funding toward groups that may not provide comprehensive services and away from organizations that provide abortions could cripple other federal efforts to curb an explosion in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), some public health officials fear. The new rules, if adopted in their current form, would require that Title X services be physically and financially separate from abortion services. Title X funds have never been permitted to be used for abortions. But President Donald Trump and other Republicans have vowed to cut off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortions. Daltry and other public health experts are concerned that proposed changes to the Title X family planning program rules may result in the closing of some Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics that also provide abortion services. However, advocates of the Trump administration’s plan point out that some new clinics may also now get Title X funding. Dr. Anne Nolte, a family physician at St. Peter’s Gianna Center, a gynecology and infertility practice in New York City, said doctors at her practice don’t prescribe birth control pills or other FDA-approved methods of contraception. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing. The recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments. She will want to know if you are taking any medications and if you are under the care of another doctor, including a primary care physician or other medical professional like a therapist or psychiatrist.She will ask about tobacco, alcohol, and drug use—past and present.She will cover questions about allergies and childhood illnesses.How Planned Parenthood is funded has been a contentious issue in the United States for quite some time. The services that Planned Parenthood provides to women (and men) are largely preventive and diagnostic. They conduct STI/STD screenings, provide contraceptive advice as well as contraceptives, give pregnancy tests, give Pap tests (for cervical cancer screening), and provide abortions. The fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortions is the bone of contention over funding, particularly from the federal government. However, abortions make up a small percentage of the services they provide, and abortions cannot be paid for from the funding the organization receives from the federal government. Despite the controversy, these clinics continue to provide care to women across the United States.\n\n"

In a joint statement Thursday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), said they have developed a multidisciplinary task force to investigate trace amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a \"probable human carcinogen,\" detected in some generic versions of the medication valsartan. The FDA recently updated the list of products affected and the list of those unaffected. \"Currently, more than half of all valsartan products on the market are being recalled. But prescribers can find a similar replacement product within the same class to substitute for patients who require this medication.\" The FDA said it is working with companies to take \"swift action\" to pull any products found with unacceptable amounts of NDMA from the U.S. market.

CDER toxicologists and chemists estimated that if 8,000 people took the highest valsartan dose from NDMA-affected medicines every day for four years, which is the period of time officials believe the affected products have been on the U.S. market, there may be one extra case of cancer beyond the regular average cancer rate of Americans.

Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03 mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations. On March 16, 2007 pet food manufacturer Menu Foods announced a recall of dog food sold under 53 brands, and cat food sold under 42 brands, after an unknown number of animals suffered kidney failure after eating it. Mao Lijun, the general manager of Xuzhou Anying Biologic, denies directly supplying ChemNutra with the wheat gluten, claiming that \"We have never exported to the U.S.\" since they are a trading company. On February 6, 2008, a federal grand \n\nMilk allergy is an adverse immune reaction to one or more proteins in cow's milk. In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. Within non-IgE cow's milk allergy, clinicians distinguish among food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Common trigger foods for all are cow's milk and soy foods (including soy infant formula). Infants reacting to cow's milk may also react to soy formula, and vice versa. Some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not. Six major allergenic proteins from cow's milk have been identified: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-casein from casein proteins and α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin from whey proteins. Heat can reduce allergenic potential, so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese. Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, conducted by an allergy specialist. It concluded \"None of the cut-offs proposed in the literature can be used to definitely confirm cow's milk allergy diagnosis, either to fresh pasteurized or to baked milk.\" Lactose intolerance\n\nMilk allergy is distinct from lactose intolerance, which is a nonallergic food sensitivity caused by the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. The unabsorbed lactose reaches the large intestine, where resident bacteria use it for fuel, releasing hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane gases. Primary lactose intolerance is caused by decreasing levels of lactase brought on by age. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. For mothers of infants considered at high risk of developing cow's milk allergy because of a family history, there is some evidence that the nursing mother avoiding allergens may reduce risk of the child developing eczema, but a Cochrane review concluded that more research is needed. Guidelines from various government and international organizations recommend that for the lowest allergy risk, infants be exclusively breastfed for 4–6 months. If a nursing mother decides to start feeding with an infant formula prior to four months the recommendation is to use a formula containing cow's milk proteins. A different consideration occurs when there is a family history – either parents or older siblings – of milk allergy. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a label claim for hydrolyzed whey protein being hypoallergenic. Soy formula is a common substitution, but infants with milk allergy may also have an allergic response to soy formula. Avoiding dairy\n\nMost people find it necessary to strictly avoid any item containing dairy ingredients. Beyond the obvious (anything with milk, cheese, cream, curd, butter, ghee or yogurt in the name), in countries where allergen labeling is mandatory, the ingredient list is supposed to list all ingredients. Anyone with or caring for a person with a dairy protein allergy should always carefully read food package labels, as sometimes even a familiar brand undergoes an ingredient change. In the U.S., for all foods except meat, poultry and egg processed products and most alcoholic beverages, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have the food name in parentheses, for example \"Casein (milk),\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \"Contains milk\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). The U.S. FDA has a recall process for foods that contain undeclared allergenic ingredients. This list contains the following examples:\n\n Bread, baked goods and desserts \n Caramel and nougat candies\n Cereals, crackers, food bars\n Chewing gum \n Chocolate ('milk' and 'dark') \n \"Cream of...\" soups\n Creamy pasta sauces \n Creamy salad dressings\n Eggnog\n Flavored potato chips\n Hot dogs and lunch meat\n Instant mashed potatoes \n Margarine\n Medical food beverages \n Non-dairy creamer\n Sherbet\n Pudding and custard\n\nThere is a distinction between “Contains ___” and “May contain ___.” The first is a deliberate addition to the ingredients of a food, and is required. Nevertheless, some people with cow's milk allergy can tolerate goat's or sheep's milk, and vice versa. Milk from camels, pigs, reindeer, horses, and donkeys may also be tolerated in some cases. Cross-reactivity with soy\nInfants – either still 100% breastfeeding or on infant formula – and also young children may be prone to a combined cow's milk and soy protein allergy, referred to as \"milk soy protein intolerance\" (MSPI). A U.S. state government website presents the concept, including a recommendation that nursing mothers discontinue eating any foods that contain dairy or soy ingredients. A review presented information on milk allergy, soy allergy and cross-reactivity between the two. Milk allergy was described as occurring in 2.2% to 2.8% of infants and declining with age. Soy allergy was described as occurring in zero to 0.7% of young children. According to several studies cited in the review, between 10% and 14% of infants and young children with confirmed cow's milk allergy were determined to also be sensitized to soy and in some instances have a clinical reaction after consuming a soy-containing food. The research did not address whether the cause was two separate allergies or a cross-reaction due to a similarity in protein structure, as which occurs for cow's milk and goat's milk. Recommendations are that infants diagnosed as allergic to cow's milk infant formula be switched to an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula rather than a soy whole protein formula. Prognosis\nMilk allergy typically presents in the first year of life. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy by the age of ten years. Children are often better able to tolerate milk as an ingredient in baked goods relative to liquid milk. Childhood predictors for adult-persistence are anaphylaxis, high milk-specific serum IgE, robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to milk-containing baked foods. The offending protein appears to be bovine serum albumin. Milk allergy has consequences. In a U.S. government diet and health surveys conducted in 2007–2010, 6,189 children ages 2–17 years were assessed. For those classified as cow's milk allergic at the time of the survey, mean weight, height, and body-mass index were significantly lower than their non-allergic peers. The percentage of babies in developed countries with milk allergy is between 2% and 3%. National survey data in the U.S. collected from 2005–2006 showed that from age six and older, the percentage with IgE-confirmed milk allergy was under 0.4%. For all age groups, a review conducted in Europe estimated 0.6% had milk allergy. Society and culture\nDairy allergy was one of the earliest food allergies to be recorded. An ancient Greek medical text attributed to the doctor Hippocrates ( 460 –  370 BC) notes in the context of a description of how some foods are harmful to certain individuals but not others, \"...cheese does not harm all men alike; some can eat their fill of it without the slightest hurt, nay, those it agrees with are wonderfully strengthened thereby. With the passage of mandatory labeling laws, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their immediate caregivers. In the U.S., the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALPA) causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. Regulation of labeling\n\nIn response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods. Nevertheless, there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil. Ingredients intentionally added\nIn the U.S., the FALPA requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains a major food allergen added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. This list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients, such as added milk proteins. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination\nThe value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as \"may contain\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. The EU has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but it is not expected to be published before 2024. Lack of compliance with labeling regulations is also a problem. As an example, the FDA documented failure to list milk as an ingredient in dark chocolate bars. The FDA tested 94 dark chocolate bars for the presence of milk. Many of those did have PAL wording such as \"may contain dairy.\" Others claimed to be \"dairy free\" or \"vegan\" but still tested positive for cow's milk proteins. In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. Research\nDesensitization, which is a slow process of consuming tiny amounts of the allergenic protein until the body is able to tolerate more significant exposure, results in reduced symptoms or even remission of the allergy in some people and is being explored for treatment of milk allergy. There is research – not specific to milk allergy – on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies.

In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. Within non-IgE cow's milk allergy, clinicians distinguish among food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Common trigger foods for all are cow's milk and soy foods (including soy infant formula). Infants reacting to cow's milk may also react to soy formula, and vice versa. Some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not. Six major allergenic proteins from cow's milk have been identified: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-casein from casein proteins and α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin from whey proteins. Heat can reduce allergenic potential, so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese. Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, conducted by an allergy specialist. It concluded \"None of the cut-offs proposed in the literature can be used to definitely confirm cow's milk allergy diagnosis, either to fresh pasteurized or to baked milk.\" Lactose intolerance\n\nMilk allergy is distinct from lactose intolerance, which is a nonallergic food sensitivity caused by the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. The unabsorbed lactose reaches the large intestine, where resident bacteria use it for fuel, releasing hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane gases. Primary lactose intolerance is caused by decreasing levels of lactase brought on by age. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth.

Bridge to Reform waiver \nIn 2011, CMS approved a Section 1115 Medicaid waiver called Bridge to Reform. It also made enrollment in managed care plans (as opposed to fee-for-service programs) mandatory for people with disabilities with the intention of improving care coordination and reducing costs. Renewal of the waiver in 2015 extended the program to 2020 in an initiative called Medi-Cal 2020, with additional programs including additional alternative payment systems, the Dental Transformation Initiative, and the Whole Person Care program focused on high-risk, high-utilizing recipients. In the negotiation with CMS, several proposals were dropped. Government agencies\nMedi-Cal is jointly administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), while the county welfare department in each of the 58 counties is responsible for local administration of the Medi-Cal program.

County indigent medical programs can be categorized as California Medical Service Program (CMSP) and Medically Indigent Service Program (MISP) counties. The CMSP county programs are largely managed by the state, whereas MISP counties manage their own programs with their own rules and regulations. Many patients from both the CMSP and MISP county programs transitioned to Medi-Cal when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014.
