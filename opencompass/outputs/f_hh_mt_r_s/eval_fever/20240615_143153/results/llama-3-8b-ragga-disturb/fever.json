In 2011, she began dating Rowan Jones, a producer who she met during her time on The Project. As of 2015, the two work together as freelance videographers. She identifies as an atheist. An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans, also known as \"strict vegetarians\", refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances. There is inconsistent evidence for vegan diets providing a protective effect against metabolic syndrome, but some evidence suggests that a vegan diet can help with weight loss, especially in the short term. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acid, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. The word 'vegan' was coined by Donald Watson and his then-future wife Dorothy Morgan in 1944. Interest in veganism increased significantly in the 2010s. The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all. One of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri (). Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844, and in England, James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838. By the 1886 publication of Henry S. Salt's A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays, he asserts that, \"It is quite true that most—not all—Food Reformers admit into their diet such animal food as milk, butter, cheese, and eggs...\" Russell Thacher Trall's The Hygeian Home Cook-Book published in 1874 is the first known vegan cookbook in America. An early vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes, was published by C. W. Daniel in 1910. There were regular discussions about it in the Vegetarian Messenger; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians. He called it The Vegan News. The word vegan was invented by Watson and Dorothy Morgan, a schoolteacher he would later marry. They suggested allvega, neo-vegetarian, dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivores, and beaumangeur. Those in attendance were Donald Watson, Elsie B. Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Mme Pataleewa (Barbara Moore, a Russian-British engineer) observing. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society and the month of November is considered by the Society to be World Vegan Month. It published recipes and a \"vegan trade list\" of animal-free products, such as toothpastes, shoe polishes, stationery and glue. In 1947, Watson wrote: \"The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own ...\". According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word vegan was first published independently in 1962 by the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary, defined as \"a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese, or milk\". One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, Diet for a Small Planet. In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evinced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe. Into the mainstream\n\nThe vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s, especially in the latter half. The Economist declared 2019 \"the year of the vegan\". Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan-processed food. The Vegetarian Butcher (), the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010, while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016. In 2011, Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Veganz in Berlin and Vegilicious in Dortmund. In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich (traditionally a meat-heavy event) offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history. There was a 185% increase in new vegan products between 2012 and 2016 in the UK. In 2017, the United States School Nutrition Association found 14% of school districts across the country were serving vegan school meals compared to 11.5% of schools offering vegan lunch in 2016, reflecting a change happening in many parts of the world, including Brazil and England. In total, , the largest share of vegan consumers globally currently reside in Asia Pacific with nine percent of people following a vegan diet. This exceeds the projected growth in the second and third fastest-growing vegan markets internationally in the same period, the United Arab Emirates (10.6%) and Australia (9.6%) respectively. The growth of schools serving vegan school meals has increased in recent years with the lunches added by Los Angeles, California in 2018, Portland, Maine in 2019, and New York City in 2022. Veganuary is a UK-based non-profit organization that educates and encourages people around the world to try a vegan diet for the month of January. Veganuary also refers to the month-long challenge itself. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the origin of which is widely agreed to be the consumption of bats, over 100 British celebrities including John Bishop, Ricky Gervais, Jane Goodall, Johnny Marr, Deborah Meaden, and Paul McCartney signed a joint letter alongside various politicians and NGOs calling on people to join the fight against climate change and prevent future pandemics through changing to a plant-based diet, starting with signing up for Veganuary. In January 2021, 582,538 people from 209 different countries and territories signed up for Veganuary, breaking the previous year's record of 400,000. That same month, ONA in France became the first vegan restaurant in the country to receive a Michelin star. At the end of the year, a poll conducted by The Guardian showed that a new high of 36% of the British public were interested in veganism. Prevalence by country\n\n: Australians topped Google's worldwide searches for the word \"vegan\" between mid-2015 and mid-2016. : A 2016 iVOX online study found that out of 1000 Dutch-speaking residents of Flanders and Brussels of 18 years and over, 0.3 percent were vegan. : In 2018, one survey estimated that 2.1 percent of adult Canadians considered themselves as vegans. A 2015 survey by Globes and Israel's Channel 2 News similarly found 5% of Israelis were vegan. Veganism increased among Israeli Arabs. Veganism also simplifies adherence to the Judaic prohibition on combining meat and milk in meals. : Between 0.6 and 3 percent of Italians were reported to be vegan . : In 2018, the Dutch Society for Veganism () estimated there were more than 100,000 Dutch vegans (0.59 percent), based on their membership growth. In July 2020 the NVV estimated the number of vegans in the Netherlands at 150,000. : Four percent said they were vegan in a 2014 Demoskop poll. : Market research company DemoSCOPE estimated in 2017 that three percent of the population was vegan. : A 2016 Ipsos MORI study commissioned by the Vegan Society, surveying almost 10,000 people aged 15 or over across England, Scotland, and Wales, found that 1.05 percent were vegan; the Vegan Society estimates that 542,000 in the UK follow a vegan diet. According to a 2018 survey by Comparethemarket.com, the number of people who identify as vegans in the United Kingdom has risen to over 3.5 million, which is approximately seven percent of the population, and environmental concerns were a major factor in this development. However, doubt was cast on this inflated figure by the UK-based Vegan Society, who perform their own regular survey: the Vegan Society themselves found in 2018 that there were 600,000 vegans in Great Britain (1.16%), which was seen as a dramatic increase on previous figures. YouGov reported 3% vegans in 2021.\n: Estimates of vegans in the U.S. in past varied from 2% (Gallup, 2012) to 0.5% (Faunalytics, 2014). According to the latter, 70% of those who adopted a vegan diet abandoned it. However, Top Trends in Prepared Foods 2017, a report by GlobalData, estimated that \"6% of US consumers now claim to be vegan, up from just 1% in 2014.\" In 2020, YouGov published results of 2019 research which showed only 2.26% reported being vegan. Nearly 59% of the vegan respondents were female. According to Gallup, black Americans are three times more likely to be vegan and vegetarian than whites as of July 2018 (9% compared to 3%). Philosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are \"deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society\". Animal Ingredients A to Z (2004) and Veganissimo A to Z (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The Leaping Bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan. Meat, eggs and dairy\n\nLike vegetarians, vegans do not eat meat (including beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, animal seafood). The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products and eggs. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. Some vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, artificial leather (pleather), rubber, and vinyl. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production. Toiletries \n\nVegans replace personal care products and household cleaners containing animal products with products that are vegan. Insect products\n\nVegan groups disagree about insect products. Some vegans believe that exploiting the labor of bees and harvesting their energy source is immoral, and that commercial beekeeping operations can harm and even kill bees. This is particularly true for domesticated cats and dogs, for which vegan pet food is both available and nutritionally complete, such as Vegepet. Nutritionally complete vegan pet diets are comparable to meat-based ones for cats and dogs. A 2015 study found that 6 out of 24 commercial vegan pet food brands do not meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) labeling regulations for amino acid adequacy. Vegans may avoid certain vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, which is commonly produced in chicken eggs. Vegan diets, substitutions, and meat analogues\n\nVegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meat substitutes\nVegan meat alternatives are commonly sold in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers. However, in the late 2010s many meat producers and supermarkets also started making their own brands of vegan meat substitutes. Butter and margarine can be replaced with alternate vegan products. These include Perfect Day, Novacca, Motif FoodWorks, Remilk, Final Foods, Imagindairy, Nourish Ingredients, and Circe. Raw veganism\n\nRaw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above . A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds, and sea vegetables. Vegan nutrition\n\nHealth effects\n\nThe evidence that a vegan diet confers health benefits is inconsistent. A 2018 meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that \"In most countries, a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio-metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet.\" Vegans tend to have a lower body mass index than omniovores, and lower levels of serum cholesterol and blood glucose. Vegans are at risk of low bone mineral density without supplement for the aforementioned nutrients. Vegan diets appear to help weight loss, especially in the short term. There is some tentative evidence of an association between vegan diets and a reduced risk of cancer. A vegan diet without caloric restriction offers the same benefit in helping with high blood pressure like diets recommended by medical societies and portion-controlled diets. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2020 looking into inflammation markers found that a vegan diet was associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein compared to omnivores. A 2021 review looking into the impact of vegan and vegetarian diets on physical performance concludes that \"research has failed to demonstrate consistent differences of performance between diets but a trend towards improved performance after vegetarian and vegan diets for both endurance and strength exercise has been shown\". Positions of dietetic and government associations\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegetarian or vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age, as does the British Dietetic Association, British National Health Service and the Canadian Pediatric Society. Pregnancy, infants and children\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets \"appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes\". The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, babies, children, and adolescents. Nutrients \n\nVegan diets are high in fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, and unsaturated fat. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that special attention may be necessary to ensure that a vegan diet will provide adequate amounts of vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, iodine, iron, and zinc. It also states that concern that vegans and vegan athletes may not consume an adequate amount and quality of protein is unsubstantiated. The  has developed guidelines for vegan nutrition. Donald Watson, co-founder of The Vegan Society, stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, \"If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded.\" He has also stated that \"vegetarianism, whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone.\" Law professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Philosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is \"subtly human-centred\", an example of what she called \"human/nature dualism\" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. David Pearce, a transhumanist philosopher, has argued that humanity has a \"hedonistic imperative\" to not merely avoid cruelty to animals or abolish the ownership of non-human animals, but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering ceases to exist. The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence. Veganarchists identify the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both human and non-human, and advocate for the adoption of a vegan lifestyle within a stateless society. Steven Best, animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to \"the property status of animals\", but also \"a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general.\" In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical \"Go Vegan\" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that \"for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia.\" Donald Watson has stated that he \"respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends.\" Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of anti-natalism, as they see the two as complementary in terms of \"harm reduction\" to animals and the environment. Vegan social psychologist Melanie Joy described the ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products as carnism, as a sort of opposite to veganism. The first vegan activist, Donald Watson, has stated, \"If these butchers and vivisectors weren't there, could we perform the acts that they are doing? Feminist veganism\n\nPioneers\nOne of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J. Adams. Her premier work, The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory (1990), noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. In one of her speeches, \"Why feminist-vegan now? \"—adapted from her original address at the \"Minding Animals\" conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)—Adams stated that \"the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974\", illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Feminist scholar Angella Duvnjak stated in \"Joining the Dots: Some Reflections on Feminist-Vegan Political Practice and Choice\" that she was met with opposition when she pointed out the connection between feminist and vegan ideals, even though the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011). This connection is further mirrored by feminist vegan writers like Carrie Hamilton, who pointed out that violent \"rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals\" suggesting there is a parallel between the violence of rape and animal cruelty. Some interpretations of Christian vegetarianism, Hindu vegetarianism, and Buddhist vegetarianism also recommend or mandate a vegan diet. Donald Watson argued, \"If Jesus were alive today, he'd be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days, spreading the message of compassion, which, as I see it, is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and, sad as it seems, I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the Vegan Society.\" According to Shah, the area where most vegans of color feel the greatest rift with mainstream veganism is in mainstream veganism's failure to recognize the intersectionality with other social justice issues such as food access. PETA columnist Zachary Tolivar noted he had often heard Black veganism called \"a revolutionary act\" because it often involves rejecting both family tradition and systemic oppression. Amirah Mercer described it as \"revoking my own Black card\" and said that for US Blacks, choosing veganism was an act of protest against disenfranchisement by governmental health care and food policy. Politics and activism \n\nIn 2021, vegan climate activist Greta Thunberg called for more vegan food production and consumption worldwide. Parties like Tierschutzpartei in Germany and PACMA in Spain have pro-vegan agendas. In the European Union, meat producers and vegans argue whether vegan food products should be allowed to use labels like \"sausages\" or \"burgers\" for vegan food. Demographics \nIn the United States, vegans (making up 2% of the population) tend to be middle-class, white, female-identified, educated, agnostic or atheist, and urban-dwelling. Prejudice against vegans\n\nVegan rights \nIn some countries, vegans have some rights to meals and legal protections against discrimination. After not being provided a vegan option in this context, a vegan employee has been granted an additional food allowance. In Portugal, starting in 2017, public administration canteens and cafeterias such as schools, prisons and social services must offer at least one vegan option at every meal. In the United Kingdom, an employment tribunal ruled in 2020 that the Equality Act 2010 protects \"ethical veganism\", a belief it defined as veganism that extends beyond diet to all areas of life and is motivated by a concern for animals. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and the Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, such as a vegan flag. Economics of veganism\n\nThe 2014 documentary film Cowspiracy estimates that a vegan, over the course of one year, will save 1.5 million litres of water, 6,607 kg of grain, 1,022 square metres of forest cover, 3,322 kg of , and 365 animal lives compared to the average U.S. diet. According to a 2016 study, if everyone in the U.S. switched to a vegan diet, the country would save $208.2 billion in direct health-care savings, $40.5 billion in indirect health-care savings, $40.5 billion in environmental savings, and $289.1 billion in total savings by 2050. The study also found that if everybody in the world switched to a vegan diet, the global economy would save $684.4 billion in direct health-care savings, $382.6 billion in indirect health-care savings, $569.5 billion in environmental savings, and $1.63 trillion in total savings by 2050. In his 2015 book Doing Good Better, William MacAskill stated the following (citing numbers from a 2011 book, Compassion by the pound):\n\nSee also\n\n Animal-free agriculture\n Organic animal-free agriculture\n Animal rights\n Buddhist cuisine\n Healthy diet\n List of diets\n List of vegan media\n Raw veganism\n Vegan nutrition\n Vegan school meal\n Vegan studies\n Veganuary\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n The Vegan Society\n\nBibliography \n\n Williams, Howard.

However, Top Trends in Prepared Foods 2017, a report by GlobalData, estimated that \"6% of US consumers now claim to be vegan, up from just 1% in 2014.\" In 2020, YouGov published results of 2019 research which showed only 2.26% reported being vegan. Nearly 59% of the vegan respondents were female. According to Gallup, black Americans are three times more likely to be vegan and vegetarian than whites as of July 2018 (9% compared to 3%). Philosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are \"deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society\". Animal Ingredients A to Z (2004) and Veganissimo A to Z (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The Leaping Bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan. Meat, eggs and dairy\n\nLike vegetarians, vegans do not eat meat (including beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, animal seafood). The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products and eggs. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. Some vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, artificial leather (pleather), rubber, and vinyl. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production. Toiletries \n\nVegans replace personal care products and household cleaners containing animal products with products that are vegan. Insect products\n\nVegan groups disagree about insect products. Some vegans believe that exploiting the labor of bees and harvesting their energy source is immoral, and that commercial beekeeping operations can harm and even kill bees. This is particularly true for domesticated cats and dogs, for which vegan pet food is both available and nutritionally complete, such as Vegepet. Nutritionally complete vegan pet diets are comparable to meat-based ones for cats and dogs. A 2015 study found that 6 out of 24 commercial vegan pet food brands do not meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) labeling regulations for amino acid adequacy. Vegans may avoid certain vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, which is commonly produced in chicken eggs. Vegan diets, substitutions, and meat analogues\n\nVegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meat substitutes\nVegan meat alternatives are commonly sold in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers. However, in the late 2010s many meat producers and supermarkets also started making their own brands of vegan meat substitutes. Butter and margarine can be replaced with alternate vegan products. These include Perfect Day, Novacca, Motif FoodWorks, Remilk, Final Foods, Imagindairy, Nourish Ingredients, and Circe. Raw veganism\n\nRaw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above . A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds, and sea vegetables. Vegan nutrition\n\nHealth effects\n\nThe evidence that a vegan diet confers health benefits is inconsistent. A 2018 meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that \"In most countries, a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio-metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet.\" Vegans tend to have a lower body mass index than omniovores, and lower levels of serum cholesterol and blood glucose. Vegans are at risk of low bone mineral density without supplement for the aforementioned nutrients. Vegan diets appear to help weight loss, especially in the short term. There is some tentative evidence of an association between vegan diets and a reduced risk of cancer. A vegan diet without caloric restriction offers the same benefit in helping with high blood pressure like diets recommended by medical societies and portion-controlled diets. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2020 looking into inflammation markers found that a vegan diet was associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein compared to omnivores. A 2021 review looking into the impact of vegan and vegetarian diets on physical performance concludes that \"research has failed to demonstrate consistent differences of performance between diets but a trend towards improved performance after vegetarian and vegan diets for both endurance and strength exercise has been shown\". Positions of dietetic and government associations\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegetarian or vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age, as does the British Dietetic Association, British National Health Service and the Canadian Pediatric Society. Pregnancy, infants and children\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets \"appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes\". The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, babies, children, and adolescents. Nutrients \n\nVegan diets are high in fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, and unsaturated fat. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that special attention may be necessary to ensure that a vegan diet will provide adequate amounts of vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, iodine, iron, and zinc. It also states that concern that vegans and vegan athletes may not consume an adequate amount and quality of protein is unsubstantiated. The  has developed guidelines for vegan nutrition. Donald Watson, co-founder of The Vegan Society, stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, \"If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded.\" He has also stated that \"vegetarianism, whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone.\" Law professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Philosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is \"subtly human-centred\", an example of what she called \"human/nature dualism\" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. David Pearce, a transhumanist philosopher, has argued that humanity has a \"hedonistic imperative\" to not merely avoid cruelty to animals or abolish the ownership of non-human animals, but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering ceases to exist. The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence. Veganarchists identify the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both human and non-human, and advocate for the adoption of a vegan lifestyle within a stateless society. Steven Best, animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to \"the property status of animals\", but also \"a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general.\" In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical \"Go Vegan\" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that \"for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia.\" Donald Watson has stated that he \"respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends.\" Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of anti-natalism, as they see the two as complementary in terms of \"harm reduction\" to animals and the environment. Vegan social psychologist Melanie Joy described the ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products as carnism, as a sort of opposite to veganism. The first vegan activist, Donald Watson, has stated, \"If these butchers and vivisectors weren't there, could we perform the acts that they are doing? Feminist veganism\n\nPioneers\nOne of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J. Adams. Her premier work, The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory (1990), noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. In one of her speeches, \"Why feminist-vegan now? \"—adapted from her original address at the \"Minding Animals\" conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)—Adams stated that \"the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974\", illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Feminist scholar Angella Duvnjak stated in \"Joining the Dots: Some Reflections on Feminist-Vegan Political Practice and Choice\" that she was met with opposition when she pointed out the connection between feminist and vegan ideals, even though the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011). This connection is further mirrored by feminist vegan writers like Carrie Hamilton, who pointed out that violent \"rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals\" suggesting there is a parallel between the violence of rape and animal cruelty. Some interpretations of Christian vegetarianism, Hindu vegetarianism, and Buddhist vegetarianism also recommend or mandate a vegan diet. Donald Watson argued, \"If Jesus were alive today, he'd be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days, spreading the message of compassion, which, as I see it, is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and, sad as it seems, I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the Vegan Society.\" According to Shah, the area where most vegans of color feel the greatest rift with mainstream veganism is in mainstream veganism's failure to recognize the intersectionality with other social justice issues such as food access. PETA columnist Zachary Tolivar noted he had often heard Black veganism called \"a revolutionary act\" because it often involves rejecting both family tradition and systemic oppression. Amirah Mercer described it as \"revoking my own Black card\" and said that for US Blacks, choosing veganism was an act of protest against disenfranchisement by governmental health care and food policy. Politics and activism \n\nIn 2021, vegan climate activist Greta Thunberg called for more vegan food production and consumption worldwide. Parties like Tierschutzpartei in Germany and PACMA in Spain have pro-vegan agendas. In the European Union, meat producers and vegans argue whether vegan food products should be allowed to use labels like \"sausages\" or \"burgers\" for vegan food. Demographics \nIn the United States, vegans (making up 2% of the population) tend to be middle-class, white, female-identified, educated, agnostic or atheist, and urban-dwelling. Prejudice against vegans\n\nVegan rights \nIn some countries, vegans have some rights to meals and legal protections against discrimination. After not being provided a vegan option in this context, a vegan employee has been granted an additional food allowance. In Portugal, starting in 2017, public administration canteens and cafeterias such as schools, prisons and social services must offer at least one vegan option at every meal. In the United Kingdom, an employment tribunal ruled in 2020 that the Equality Act 2010 protects \"ethical veganism\", a belief it defined as veganism that extends beyond diet to all areas of life and is motivated by a concern for animals. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and the Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, such as a vegan flag. Economics of veganism\n\nThe 2014 documentary film Cowspiracy estimates that a vegan, over the course of one year, will save 1.5 million litres of water, 6,607 kg of grain, 1,022 square metres of forest cover, 3,322 kg of , and 365 animal lives compared to the average U.S. diet. According to a 2016 study, if everyone in the U.S. switched to a vegan diet, the country would save $208.2 billion in direct health-care savings, $40.5 billion in indirect health-care savings, $40.5 billion in environmental savings, and $289.1 billion in total savings by 2050. The study also found that if everybody in the world switched to a vegan diet, the global economy would save $684.4 billion in direct health-care savings, $382.6 billion in indirect health-care savings, $569.5 billion in environmental savings, and $1.63 trillion in total savings by 2050. In his 2015 book Doing Good Better, William MacAskill stated the following (citing numbers from a 2011 book, Compassion by the pound):\n\nSee also\n\n Animal-free agriculture\n Organic animal-free agriculture\n Animal rights\n Buddhist cuisine\n Healthy diet\n List of diets\n List of vegan media\n Raw veganism\n Vegan nutrition\n Vegan school meal\n Vegan studies\n Veganuary\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n The Vegan Society\n\nBibliography \n\n Williams, Howard. An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans, also known as \"strict vegetarians\", refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances. There is inconsistent evidence for vegan diets providing a protective effect against metabolic syndrome, but some evidence suggests that a vegan diet can help with weight loss, especially in the short term. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acid, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. The word 'vegan' was coined by Donald Watson and his then-future wife Dorothy Morgan in 1944. Interest in veganism increased significantly in the 2010s. The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all. One of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri (). Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844, and in England, James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838. By the 1886 publication of Henry S. Salt's A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays, he asserts that, \"It is quite true that most—not all—Food Reformers admit into their diet such animal food as milk, butter, cheese, and eggs...\" Russell Thacher Trall's The Hygeian Home Cook-Book published in 1874 is the first known vegan cookbook in America. An early vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes, was published by C. W. Daniel in 1910. There were regular discussions about it in the Vegetarian Messenger; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians. He called it The Vegan News. The word vegan was invented by Watson and Dorothy Morgan, a schoolteacher he would later marry. They suggested allvega, neo-vegetarian, dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivores, and beaumangeur. Those in attendance were Donald Watson, Elsie B. Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Mme Pataleewa (Barbara Moore, a Russian-British engineer) observing. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society and the month of November is considered by the Society to be World Vegan Month. It published recipes and a \"vegan trade list\" of animal-free products, such as toothpastes, shoe polishes, stationery and glue. In 1947, Watson wrote: \"The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own ...\". According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word vegan was first published independently in 1962 by the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary, defined as \"a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese, or milk\". One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, Diet for a Small Planet. In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evinced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe. Into the mainstream\n\nThe vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s, especially in the latter half. The Economist declared 2019 \"the year of the vegan\". Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan-processed food. The Vegetarian Butcher (), the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010, while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016. In 2011, Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Veganz in Berlin and Vegilicious in Dortmund. In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich (traditionally a meat-heavy event) offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history. There was a 185% increase in new vegan products between 2012 and 2016 in the UK. In 2017, the United States School Nutrition Association found 14% of school districts across the country were serving vegan school meals compared to 11.5% of schools offering vegan lunch in 2016, reflecting a change happening in many parts of the world, including Brazil and England. In total, , the largest share of vegan consumers globally currently reside in Asia Pacific with nine percent of people following a vegan diet. This exceeds the projected growth in the second and third fastest-growing vegan markets internationally in the same period, the United Arab Emirates (10.6%) and Australia (9.6%) respectively. The growth of schools serving vegan school meals has increased in recent years with the lunches added by Los Angeles, California in 2018, Portland, Maine in 2019, and New York City in 2022. Veganuary is a UK-based non-profit organization that educates and encourages people around the world to try a vegan diet for the month of January. Veganuary also refers to the month-long challenge itself. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the origin of which is widely agreed to be the consumption of bats, over 100 British celebrities including John Bishop, Ricky Gervais, Jane Goodall, Johnny Marr, Deborah Meaden, and Paul McCartney signed a joint letter alongside various politicians and NGOs calling on people to join the fight against climate change and prevent future pandemics through changing to a plant-based diet, starting with signing up for Veganuary. In January 2021, 582,538 people from 209 different countries and territories signed up for Veganuary, breaking the previous year's record of 400,000. That same month, ONA in France became the first vegan restaurant in the country to receive a Michelin star. At the end of the year, a poll conducted by The Guardian showed that a new high of 36% of the British public were interested in veganism. Prevalence by country\n\n: Australians topped Google's worldwide searches for the word \"vegan\" between mid-2015 and mid-2016. : A 2016 iVOX online study found that out of 1000 Dutch-speaking residents of Flanders and Brussels of 18 years and over, 0.3 percent were vegan. : In 2018, one survey estimated that 2.1 percent of adult Canadians considered themselves as vegans. A 2015 survey by Globes and Israel's Channel 2 News similarly found 5% of Israelis were vegan. Veganism increased among Israeli Arabs. Veganism also simplifies adherence to the Judaic prohibition on combining meat and milk in meals. : Between 0.6 and 3 percent of Italians were reported to be vegan . : In 2018, the Dutch Society for Veganism () estimated there were more than 100,000 Dutch vegans (0.59 percent), based on their membership growth. In July 2020 the NVV estimated the number of vegans in the Netherlands at 150,000. : Four percent said they were vegan in a 2014 Demoskop poll. : Market research company DemoSCOPE estimated in 2017 that three percent of the population was vegan. : A 2016 Ipsos MORI study commissioned by the Vegan Society, surveying almost 10,000 people aged 15 or over across England, Scotland, and Wales, found that 1.05 percent were vegan; the Vegan Society estimates that 542,000 in the UK follow a vegan diet. According to a 2018 survey by Comparethemarket.com, the number of people who identify as vegans in the United Kingdom has risen to over 3.5 million, which is approximately seven percent of the population, and environmental concerns were a major factor in this development. However, doubt was cast on this inflated figure by the UK-based Vegan Society, who perform their own regular survey: the Vegan Society themselves found in 2018 that there were 600,000 vegans in Great Britain (1.16%), which was seen as a dramatic increase on previous figures. YouGov reported 3% vegans in 2021.\n: Estimates of vegans in the U.S. in past varied from 2% (Gallup, 2012) to 0.5% (Faunalytics, 2014).

Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, such as a vegan flag. Economics of veganism\n\nThe 2014 documentary film Cowspiracy estimates that a vegan, over the course of one year, will save 1.5 million litres of water, 6,607 kg of grain, 1,022 square metres of forest cover, 3,322 kg of , and 365 animal lives compared to the average U.S. diet. According to a 2016 study, if everyone in the U.S. switched to a vegan diet, the country would save $208.2 billion in direct health-care savings, $40.5 billion in indirect health-care savings, $40.5 billion in environmental savings, and $289.1 billion in total savings by 2050. The study also found that if everybody in the world switched to a vegan diet, the global economy would save $684.4 billion in direct health-care savings, $382.6 billion in indirect health-care savings, $569.5 billion in environmental savings, and $1.63 trillion in total savings by 2050.

Similar to the case in Berbera, Erigavo, Sheikh and other towns in the north, there was no SNM activity in Mogadishu, moreover, Mogadishu was geographically removed from the situation in the north of the country due to its position in the southern regions, nevertheless the Somali government committed to its policy of persecution of Isaaq civilians in Mogadishu.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars (out of four) and praised Oliver Stone's direction, saying, \"Much of the fascination of 'Savages' comes through Stone's treatment of the negotiations, which involve percentages, sliding scales over three years, an ultimate payout, and other financial details that drugs have in common with big business. The film gets its title from the German hymn \"Allein, und doch nicht ganz allein\" which the Leininger family frequently sang together, and is based on Tracy Leininger Craven's novel of the same name and the true story of Barbara and Regina Leininger, who were forcibly taken from their Pennsylvanian German immigrant family's home by the Delaware Indians in the 1755 Penn's Creek Massacre during the French and Indian War. It is frequently labeled a Christian film. “Der Schuh des Manitu” parodies a series of wild west adventure novels of the 19th century German author Karl May.

It's always good to step into somebody else's world for a minute and we're excited to be a part of it.\" A United Methodist Pastor in McGregor, Texas took the song's lines \"I'm not afraid to die / I'm not afraid to live\" and related it to his belief that Christians should not think of God as a stern judge and should not be afraid to live to the fullest, while a London memorial service honoring The Door magazine founder and religious figure Mike Yaconelli used it as the spiritual pivot of the service. Author Višnja Cogan partially echoed Edge's interpretation, seeing the duality of Bono's role as both father and son embodied in the song's interior climax \"I'm a man, I'm not a child....\"\n\n The song is noted for its aggressive tone, fast tempo and heavier use of guitars, in contrast to Reznor's dance-oriented previous songs from the album Pretty Hate Machine. Reznor's angst-filled lyrics in this song, such as \"After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become\" was regarded as a solidification of his status as \"the dark lord of doom.\" Farr explained that it represented what he felt was the entire theme of the album, saying it played out like an intriguing book and he didn't care that it wouldn't be played on the radio.

Some 2 kilometers up the valley near the river bed and near the Moody Creek mine, a layer of rock was found where the formation of coal had abruptly ended some 66 million years ago. This formation was key in proving the size, severity and the global nature of the Chixulub Impactor. The K–Pg boundary marks the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last period of the Mesozoic Era, and marks the beginning of the Paleogene period, the first period of the Cenozoic Era. The K–Pg boundary is associated with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction which destroyed a majority of the world's Mesozoic species, including all dinosaurs except for birds. Strong evidence exists that the extinction coincided with a large meteorite impact at the Chicxulub crater and the generally accepted scientific theory is that this impact triggered the extinction event.

The youngster has been in institutions all of his life —first orphanages, then reformatories, and finally federal prison. In 1982, Gary Cone was convicted and sentenced to death for a crime spree that included the robbery of a jewelry store, a police pursuit, and the murder of an elderly couple. At trial, Cone's attorney argued that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, and several experts testified that Cone suffered from a long history of drug abuse and post traumatic stress disorder resulting from his military service during the Vietnam War. According to one expert, Cone's long-term drug abuse caused hallucinations and paranoia that \"affected respondent's mental capacity and ability to obey the law.\" The jury rejected Cone's insanity defense and found him guilty on all counts. The trial court ultimately sentenced Cone to death, and on appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed Cone's convictions and sentence. He was mystified that the jury eventually agreed on a guilty verdict. Mahler's account has been disputed by other jury members who claim that no early vote had taken place, and that an informal vote was taken with only three jury members voting Avery not guilty. In 2002, during her trial, Marion County Deputy Prosecutor Larry Sells likened Pender to a \"Female Charles Manson\" to describe her alleged influence over Hull. Supporters of Pender claim the comparison is inappropriate because Pender did not plan, commit, or pressure Hull into murdering Nordman and Cataldi. They claim that even if Pender had been involved in planning the murders, the comparison would still be grossly exaggerated; Charles Manson was a guru with a juvenile offender record and a psychiatric history, who led several members of his sect to\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

It marks his third release on an independent record label, and his first for Surfdog Records. The album is Bell's first album in almost eight years, following It's Only Time, which was released in 2006. The lead single, \"Bitchcraft\", was released on January 28, 2014. On the night of the album's release party, Justin Bieber reportedly tried to crash the party, which also drew attention to the album. On the same night, Bell performed tracks from the album, and a Drake & Josh reunion of cast members took place, with Miranda Cosgrove, Josh Peck, Dan Schneider (the creator of the show), and Jonathan Goldstein, showing up. On November 10, a tweet made by Carlton's management announced the upcoming release of her holiday EP titled Hear the Bells on November 21. The EP consists of four tracks, two of which are acoustic versions of Carlton's songs Hear the Bells and A Thousand Miles. The album received generally positive reviews, with critics praising Bell's performance and direction for the album. AllMusic wrote in its review of Ready Steady Go!, \"Here, Bell sets his charming, resonant vocals to a mix of smartly written originals (\"Bitchcraft\") and surprisingly well-curated cover songs (the Move's \"California Man\"). review of the album, Tori Mier wrote, \"In his third studio album, Drake Bell shows an undeniable amount of capability as a musician, drawing from nearly all genres and eras of music to create his own unique sound.\" On his second full-length album Black Bear, Belle wrote songs that were autobiographical, with themes ranging from wrestling with God to restoring personal relationships. On the process of creating the record, he said: \"I began to feel limited by my original, predominately acoustic sound, [...] and as my creative taste began to change, I decided to take things in a new direction; writing songs that made me excited about music again\". In the fall of 2014, Belle released an EP entitled Black Bear (Hushed), featuring stripped down versions of five of the album's tracks.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Discovered by actress Norma Shearer, Leigh began her career appearing in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including Act of Violence (1948), Little Women (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Scaramouche (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), and Living It Up (1954). She went on to gain lasting recognition for her portrayal of the doomed Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's horror film Psycho (1960), which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting \n\n Leigh-Hunt was born in Bath, Somerset. Her most famous movie role is probably in Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy (1972), as a woman raped and strangled by a serial killer, that included the first graphically violent scene featuring visible nudity of Hitchcock's career. Richard Burton played the composer Richard \n\n her performance. Later that year, Johansson portrayed actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor. Her second marriage was to Canadian film-maker Paul Almond. Leigh had one daughter, Stephanie Leigh, also a dancer and pedagogue. At the time of her death on November 30, 2004 she was the company's artistic adviser.

The original is located in the Plaza Bolívar in Lima, the first copy is in the Plaza Bolívar in Caracas and the second copy is in United Nations Plaza in San Francisco, California. It was cast in Munich and the replica in Caracas was cast by the same foundry after the sculptor's death. Skyscrapers may loom overhead, but there is more than a hint of original colonial flavor in this neatly proportioned reconstruction of the house where Simón Bolívar was born on 24 July 1783. Much of the original colonial interior has been replaced by monumental paintings of battle scenes, but more personal relics can be seen in the nearby Bolivarian museum. The pride of the place goes to the coffin in which Bolívar's remains were brought from Colombia; his ashes now rest in the National Pantheon. Taking advantage of the disorder in Spain prompted by the Peninsular War, Bolívar began his campaign for independence in 1808. The campaign for the independence of Colombia (Gran Colombia—later New Granada) was consolidated with the victory at the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819. Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the victory at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country. Among other measures he purchased Bolívar's birthplace (near the location of the statue) and adopted the bolívar, defined on the silver standard, as the country's currency. The bolívar is named after the hero of Latin American independence Simón Bolívar.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

In 2016, describing Hedren's performance as \"one of the greatest in the history of cinema\", Richard Brody called the film a \"story of sexual violence\" inflicted on the character played by Hedren: \"The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it's so because Hitchcock was sick.

Given the prevalence of advertising-supported information goods online, it is important to understand how online advertising works.

One especially interesting aspect of online advertising is its ability to target customers using fine demographic and behavioral data. best when the advertiser has done substantial amounts of research on the demographic audience, knowing what values and ideas will trigger an emotional response and connection to the brand. The values can be embedded into the brand through images and language. An example of this would be the family values and essence of childhood and bonding portrayed in Walt Disney World Ads. Multiple studies of personal ads in the 20th century found that ads from men seeking women are more likely to place importance on physical attractiveness and ads from women seeking men are more likely to focus on financial security and psychological characteristics.

The play is divided into four acts, covering Macmillan's early life and military experience in World War I; his involvement in British politics during the descent into World War II; the Suez Crisis, during which he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; and his service as Prime Minister, during which the reputation of his government was severely damaged by the Profumo affair. In October 1963 he was made Joint-Minister of State for Trade by the new Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and the following month he was raised to the peerage as Baron Drumalbyn, of Whitesands in the Royal Burgh of Dumfries. During the Second World War, he served in a balloon squadron in the Royal Air Force and briefly held office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in the 1945 caretaker government. The title became extinct upon his death in 1974. Macmillan became Prime Minister in January 1957 and moved Bevins back to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. He had a key role in guiding through Parliament the Rent Act 1957, which removed rent control and was highly controversial. Although the role was not in Macmillan's cabinet and rather low in the formal priorities, it had a higher public profile than this situation would suggest. John Wyndham was the son of Edward Wyndham, 5th Baron Leconfield, and Gladys Mary Farquhar, and a direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham. He was educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge. He served as Private Secretary to Harold Macmillan in various appointments that the latter held between 1940 and 1945, then again in 1955 when Macmillan was Foreign Secretary, and finally during his time as Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. In 1963, four years prior to succeeding his father as Baron Leconfield, he was raised to the peerage in his own right in Macmillan's resignation honours as Baron Egremont of Petworth in the County of Sussex.

David spends his life savings on high-quality bedsheets to resell to retirement homes, but the venture fails. David runs into his old friend Efraim Diveroli, who has formed his own company, AEY Inc., selling arms to the US government for the ongoing war in Iraq. Iz informs David she is pregnant, and Efraim offers him a job at AEY; although David and Iz vehemently oppose the war, David joins AEY and lies to Iz. Efraim explains that military equipment orders are posted on a public website, and their job is to bid for small orders ignored by larger contractors \n\n had planned to seek a management position at Horizon Air or become a military officer after receiving his degree. He was active in his church and a leader in the local Christian youth ministry Young Life. Horizon Air CEO Gary Beck stated that, as far as the company knew, Russell did not have a pilot's license. During his conversation with air traffic control, Russell said he \"[knew] what [he was] doing a little bit\" because he had experience playing video games. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven bio-agents (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\nBacillus anthracis (anthrax)\nFrancisella tularensis (tularemia)\nBrucella spp (brucellosis)\nCoxiella burnetii (Q-fever)\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus\nBotulinum toxin (botulism)\nStaphylococcal enterotoxin B\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed. In 1969, President Richard Nixon allegedly ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. History\n\nEarly history (1918–1941)\nInitial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of World War I. Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended. Chief of the CWS, Amos Fries, decided that such a program would not be \"profitable\" for the U.S. Japan's Shiro Ishii began promoting biological weapons during the 1920s and toured biological research facilities worldwide, including in the United States. Though Ishii concluded that the U.S. was developing a bio-weapons programs, he was incorrect. In fact, Ishii concluded that each major power he visited was developing a bio-weapons program. Other nations, notably France, Japan and the United Kingdom, thought otherwise and had begun their own biological weapons programs. He wrote to Dr. Frank B. Jewett, then president of the NAS:\n\nBecause of the dangers that might confront this country from potential enemies employing what may be broadly described as biological warfare, it seems advisable that investigations be initiated to survey the present situation and the future possibilities. I am therefore, asking if you will undertake the appointment of an appropriate committee to survey all phases of this matter. Your organization already has before it a request from The Surgeon General for the appointment of a committee by the Division of Medical Sciences of the National Research Council to examine one phase of the matter. Though initially, under George Merck, the WRS contracted several universities to participate in the U.S. biological weapons program, the program became large quickly and before long it was under the full control of the CWS. At the trial of John W. Powell and two other defendants for sedition for reporting that the U.S. used biological weapons during the Korean War, the U.S. Attorney in the case, Robert H. Schnacke and the former Chief of the Special Operations Division at Ft. Detrick during the Korean War (and long-time U.S. Chemical Corps officer), John L. Schwab, entered sworn affidavits that the U.S. Army had the capability to use both offensive and defensive biological and chemical weapons \"during the period from January 1, 1949 through July 27, 1953.... based upon resources available and retained only within the continental limits of the United States.\" At the time, many scientists disagreed with the creation of biological weapons. Theodor Rosebury, who previously worked as a supervisor at Camp Detrick, issued a warning against the development of biological weapons during the cold war. Rosebury published Peace or Pestilence? in 1949, which explained his views on why biological weapons should be banned by world powers. By the time his book was available, publications were becoming more restricted and the extent of the Soviet threat of biological weapons was being overstated by Congress and the media. In 1969, Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson argued that the biological warfare programs would eventually hurt US security because potential enemy nations could easily emulate these weapons. This included new production plants for anthrax, brucellosis, and anti-crop agents, as well as the development of the cluster bomb. Another case of human research was the biodefense medical research program, Operation Whitecoat. This decade-long experiment on volunteer Seventh Day Adventist servicemen exposed them to tularaemia via aerosols. They were then treated with antibiotics. In the 1960s, the U.S. changed its main approach from biological agents aimed to kill to those that would incapacitate. The use of chemicals, riot-control agents, and herbicides like Agent Orange drew international criticism, and negatively affected the U.S. public opinion on the development of biological weapons. Jeanne Guillemin, wife of biologist Matthew Meselson, summarized the controversy:\n\nThe Nixon administration felt an urgent need to respond to the growing negative perception of biological weapons. Nixon noted that biological weapons were unreliable and stated:\n\nThe United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents and weapons, and all other methods of biological warfare. In his speech Nixon called his move \"unprecedented\"; and it was in fact the first review of the U.S. biological warfare program since 1954. Despite the lack of review, the biological warfare program had increased in cost and size since 1961. Nixon's statement confined all biological weapons research to defensive-only and ordered the destruction of the existing U.S. biological arsenal. Among the Protocol's provisions was a ban on bacteriological warfare. When Nixon ended the U.S. bio-weapons program in 1969 he also announced that he would resubmit the Geneva Protocol to the U.S. Senate. Thus, the Nixon administration became the world's leading anti-biological weapons voice calling for an international treaty. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. Beginning in 1972, the Soviet Union, United States and more than 100 other countries signed the BWC. They included: smallpox, EEE and WEE, AHF, Hantavirus, BHF, Lassa fever, Coronavirus, melioidosis, plague, yellow fever, psittacosis, typhus, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), CHIKV, late blight of potato, rinderpest, Newcastle disease, bird flu, and the toxin ricin. Despite contrary assertions from the International Red Cross and World Health Organization, whom the Chinese denounced as being dominated by US influence and thus biased, the Chinese government pursued an investigation by the World Peace Council. A committee led by Joseph Needham gathered evidence for a report that included testimony from eyewitnesses, doctors, and four American Korean War prisoners who confirmed use of biological weapons by the U.S. In eastern Europe, China, and North Korea it was widely believed that the accusations were true. The book received mostly positive reviews, out of a collection of 20 reviews cited, 2 were negative, calling it \"bad history\" and \"appalling\", while others praised the authors, \"Endicott and Hagerman is far and away the most authoritative work on the subject\" and \"the most impressive, expertly researched and, as far as the official files allow, the best-documented case for the prosecution yet made\". In the same year Endicott's book was published, Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents that claimed to have revealed that the biowarfare allegation was an elaborate disinformation campaign by the communists. In addition, a Japanese journalist claims to have seen similar evidence of a Soviet disinformation campaign and that the evidence supporting its occurrence was faked. In 2001, anti-communist historian Herbert Romerstein supported Weathersby and Leitenberg, criticizing Endicott's research for using evidence provided by the Chinese government. In March 2010, the allegations were investigated by the Al Jazeera English news program People & Power. In this program, Professor Mori Masataka investigated historical artifacts in the form of bomb casings from US biological weapons, contemporary documentary evidence and eyewitness testimonies. He concluded that the United States did, in fact, test biological weapons on North Korea during the Korean War. In September 2020, U.S. author Jeffrey Kaye published a set of declassified CIA communications reports (COMINT) that documented the responses of military units for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as they were apparently under attack by biological weapons, particularly the dropping of bacteria-laden insects. Some of these COMINT reports were also published a few months previously in Nicholson Baker's book, Baseless. The report stated that 'three persons. . . '”\n\nCuba\nIt has been rumored that the U.S. employed biological weapons against the Communist island nation of Cuba. Noam Chomsky claimed that evidence exists implicating the U.S. in biological warfare in Cuba. These claims are disputed, however one of the documented goals of the CIA’s Operation Mongoose was to induce crop failures in Cuba. Allegations in 1962 held that CIA operatives had contaminated a shipment of sugar while it was in storage in Cuba. Also in 1962, a  Canadian agricultural technician assisting the Cuban government claimed he was paid $5,000 to infect Cuban turkeys with the deadly Newcastle disease. Though the technician later claimed he had just pocketed the money, many Cubans and some US citizens believed a clandestinely administered biological weapons agent was responsible for a subsequent outbreak of the disease in Cuban turkeys. In 1971 the first serious outbreak of African Swine Fever in the Western Hemisphere occurred in Cuba. The Cuban government alleged that U.S. covert biological warfare was responsible for this outbreak, which led to the preemptive slaughter of 500,000 pigs. Six years after the event, the newspaper Newsday, citing an anonymous former CIA agent, claimed that anti-Castro saboteurs, with at least the tacit backing of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials, introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba six weeks before the outbreak in 1971, to destabilize the Cuban economy and encourage domestic opposition to Fidel Castro. The virus was allegedly delivered to the operatives from an army base in the Panama Canal Zone by an unnamed U.S. intelligence source. Accusations have continued to come out of Havana charging U.S. use of bio-weapons on the island, after the official end of the US biological weapons program in 1973. The Cuban government blamed the U.S. for a 1981 outbreak of dengue fever that sickened more than 300,000. Dengue 2 killed 158 people that year in Cuba, including 101 children under 15. Tensions between the two countries, coupled with confirmed U.S. research into entomological warfare during the 1950s, made these charges seem not implausible to some scientists and historians. Clinical trials\nOperation Whitecoat involved the controlled testing of many serious agents on military personnel who had  consented to experimentation, and who  understood the risks involved. No deaths are known to have resulted from this program. Veterans who took part believe they were also exposed to Agent Orange. Project 112 starting in the 1960s tested chemical and biological agents, including VX, sarin and E. coli, on military personnel who did not know they were being tested. In civilian venues\n\nMedical experiments were conducted on a large scale on civilians who had not consented to participate. The GAO scolded the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) 2003 decision to stop searching for people affected by the tests was premature. The GAO report also found that the DoD made no effort to inform civilians of exposure, and that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is failing to use available resources to inform veterans of possible exposure or to determine if they were deceased. Some of the individuals were identified after the GAO reviewed records stored at the Dugway Proving Ground, others were identified by the Institute of Medicine. Nixon ended the debate when he added toxins to the bio-weapons ban in February 1970. The U.S. also ran a series of experiments with anthrax, code named Project Bacchus, Project Clear Vision and Project Jefferson in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That law defined a biological agent as:\n\nany micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or bioengineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind ...

While that title was also used by some of James's successors, England and Scotland each remained legally separate countries, each with its own parliament, until 1707, when each parliament passed an Act of Union to ratify the Treaty of Union that had been agreed the previous year. This created a single kingdom with one parliament with effect from 1 May 1707. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority. He defeated another rebellion in 1489, took a direct interest in the administration of justice and finally brought the Lord of the Isles under control in 1493.

Wheelbases are 2.4 metres (ABG), 2.6 metres (ABF short), and 3.4 metres (ABF long). The trucks have double wheels on the rear axle. Their gearbox is 4-speed manual. The maximum gross combined weight ratings are 6 tonnes for the ABF and 13 tonnes for the ABG (tractor unit with towed cargo), with 5 and 10 tonnes payload respectively.

Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's 1960 short story \"From a View to a Kill\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin, who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, it was a commercial success, with the Duran Duran theme song \"A View to a Kill\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only Bond theme song to reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song. ; The château and the Great Stables were featured in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill, as the home of villainous Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken) which was being infiltrated by Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) in his quest to find out more about Zorin, who had already aroused suspicions of MI6 \n\n extreme revenge.

The region became the province of Irian Barat (West Irian) before being renamed Irian Jaya (literally \"Glorious Irian\") in 1973 and Papua in 2002. The following year, the second province in the region, West Papua in Manokwari, was created. Both provinces were granted special autonomous status by the Indonesian legislation. The western half of New Guinea is part of Indonesia. Today, it is known as Papua, and it is divided into two provinces – Papua and West Papua. There are two main coffee-growing areas in Papua. In West Papua, the 8 new regencies to be created were those of Malamoy, Maibratsau, North Raja Ampat, South Raja Ampat, Raja Maskona, Okas, West Manokwari and Imeo, while the new municipality is Manokwari City. Western New Guinea, also known as Papua or Indonesian New Guinea, is the western portion of New Guinea administered by Indonesia. Since the island is alternatively named as Papua, the region is also called West Papua (Papua Barat). Lying to the west of Papua New Guinea, it is the only Indonesian territory situated in Oceania.

This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus's life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius's political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have \n\n has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.

It is also possible that it was commissioned by Livia herself, Augustus‘s wife at the time of his death. Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and Tiberius Claudius (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus.

A service animal is specifically a dog (miniature horses are sometimes an exception) with specific training to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability (including physical, sensory) or mental illness. Conversely, ESAs, which also include therapy dogs, do not fall under the category of service animals. They can be used as part of a medical treatment plan for a patient, providing companionship, but they do not have special training to perform specific tasks. Ultimately, the biggest difference between the two types of animals is training, or lack thereof. And yet, this difference plays a significant role in the acceptance of both animal types as supports for those suffering from mental health issues. One of the biggest controversies between the two kinds of animals exists in air travel rules and regulations. There are generally modifications to practices, policies, and procedures when it comes to accommodating service animals in public places. Service animals are expected to be properly trained, to behave well, and to be adequately controlled by their handler. Conversely, ESAs are not required to have training, and the same regulations for service animals do not apply to them as they are under a different, more flexible designation. For example, medical documentation less than a year old must be provided for ESAs and service animals must be wearing identifying equipment. Yet, ESAs are still easily exploited by passengers. Higher up the chain, there should be more personnel education and a work-environment culture change, to ensure that staff understands mental health issues, and can establish best practices when servicing an individual who needs a support animal. While the ADA specifies that animals may be used for disabilities but not emotional support, the Air Carrier Access Act’s definition does allow animals for individuals who need them for emotional support. Ultimately, for the sake of those who appropriately use these animals, and for the health and safety of fellow travellers, a better understanding of these animals, their roles, and their handlers, should become common practice. And perhaps one day, trained pigs will be allowed to fly once again. The techniques used for training a dog depends very much on the type of work the dog is expected to perform. By training in small steps, you can train an animal to do complex behaviors. Trainers create different signals for the animals for different behaviors. This helps let the animal know the correct behavior to perform. If an animal does not respond to a signal or responds with an undesired behavior, then the trainer normally will remain motionless and wait three seconds before trying the signal again. The trainers try not to force a situation and never punish an animal for not doing a behavior correctly. The ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Contemporary Christian music (or CCM and occasionally inspirational music) is a genre of modern popular music, and an aspect of Christian media, which is lyrically focused on matters related to the Christian faith and stylistically rooted in Christian music.

Disco was characterized by the use of real orchestral instruments, such as strings, which had largely been abandoned during the 1950s because of rock music. In contrast to the 1920s, however, the use of live orchestras in night clubs was extremely rare due to its expense.

Meanwhile, Barrie's attention turned increasingly to works for the theatre, beginning with a biography of Richard Savage, written by Barrie and H. B. Marriott Watson; it was performed only once and critically panned. Another especially celebrated aspect of the production was the set, designed by John Bury, who used the work of Karl von Appen and Caspar Neher as his primary visual inspiration. However, the power of drag performance lies in its ability to create a Brechtian alienation effect and historicize the subject, which in turn stimulates critical examination and reflection. An example of Busch's thought-provoking performance is his staged reading of Ibsen's plays, Hedda Gabler and A Doll's House. In summary, Charles Busch utilizes drag performance as a way to entertain audiences while simultaneously provoking critical thinking and questioning. The production was hailed as a triumph, and is generally recognised as reviving the reputation of the Henry VI plays in the modern theatre. Writing for the Daily Mail, Bernard Levin called it a \"monumental production. The last scene - the Battle of Bosworth - sums up and sets the seal on all that has gone before.

Previously, pharma marketing professionals were required to handle ISIs in video via custom development, costly code changes, and links out to safety information. Changes were required time and again to meet the needs of each market, geography, and indication. HapYak works with any video player, content delivery network, or video management system to add interactivity—such as chapters, branching, links, and response mechanisms—to any marketing video. Easy-to-use tools let pharma marketers instantly add or modify annotations delivered from the cloud as an overlay, eliminating the need to re-cut videos to update ISI and other information. The experience works as effectively on mobile as it does in desktop environments. The company gives clinicians access to view pharmacies’ inventory in real time and order the appropriate products for their patients—along with the capability to track to see if their patients are receiving the medications/medical products they need. The company also gives pharma marketers the opportunity to reach clinicians at the exact moment at which they’re deciding to order products for their patients.

It’s powered by the company’s Content Capsule technology, which has been approved by every legal and regulatory group that has reviewed it, including 18 of the top 20 pharma companies. NextWorks’ Content Capsule technology natively places interactive brand experiences (portable microsites) in client-approved editorial copy written by key influencers. The Capsule technology creates self-contained, visually interactive branded and unbranded content experiences featuring product, physician, and consumer testimonial videos, images, documents, important safety information, and calls to action. Together the content forms a valuable information package that’s delivered from a trusted source at the very moment a consumer is seeking related information. Every interaction with each piece of content on every individual blog post is measured in a client-facing dashboard. Clients can pre-determine the number of views and buy on a CPM or set fee basis. The units contain all required fair balance information and, if changes are necessary, all content can be simultaneously updated across all blog posts and embedded locations. In addition to being an innovative influencer marketing solution, one Content Capsule can also function as a microsite, rich media and native ad unit, and an embeddable content marketing solution that can be placed on any website where a target audience seeks information related to a brand’s message.

Walsh is portrayed by actor Jack Falahee, who auditioned for the role on How to Get Away with Murder during the television pilot season (January to February) in 2014. Falahee had initially auditioned through video for the assistant to the casting director of Murder, before auditioning for another pilot series, Agatha. By February, Falahee joined the series' creator and executive producer, Peter Nowalk, for screen tests in the role of Walsh; the scene was for the pilot episode, whereby the character is at a bar trying to pick up Oliver. Nowalk was full of awe in response to Falahee's audition, adamant that, \"[f]rom the minute he opened his mouth, he sounded just like Connor should\". Falahee later had roles in a number of independent films, including Hunter, Blood and Circumstance and Slider. On February 12, 2014, Falahee was cast in the series regular role of the ABC legal thriller series How to Get Away with Murder, produced by Shonda Rhimes. He played the role of one of the five lead students, Connor \n\n The character as well as Falahee's acting have been well received by both fans and critics of the series. IndieWire went further, stating: \"He's definitely not an ideal human being, but he's certainly an authentic fascinating one.\" Vanity Fair columnist, Richard Lawson, was partly drawn to the series because of the character Walsh, commending \"Falahee’s ambitious, underhanded Connor Walsh [who is] allowed to be both good and bad, saint and sinner.\" TVOvermind praised Falahee for his portrayal of Walsh, contending that the actor \"plays his role to a tee.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

On March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer. After building it for himself and showing it at the club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. It was started by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc. and designer of the Apple I and Apple II personal computers. The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak. It was designed by Steve Wozniak. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars (Wozniak later said that Jobs planned instead to use his bicycle to get around), and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500.

The monarchy was deposed in 1975 and Sikkim became the 22nd state of India. Sikkim was integrated as the eighth North Eastern Council state in 2002. The official languages are English, Nepali, Sikkimese and Lepcha. Additional languages include Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Mukhia, Newari, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang. The main religion is Hinduism, practiced by the Nepalese, followed by Buddhism, practiced by the Tibetans and Bhutias. Sikkim's economy is largely dependent on agriculture.

THI was founded by Dr. Regi George and Dr. Lalitha Regi in 1993 to provide quality healthcare at an affordable rate to the tribal population of Sittilingi village in rural Tamil Nadu with just one Outpatient unit (OP). As of 2010 it had grown to include a 24-bed hospital with a labour room, neonatal unit, operation theatre, diagnostic laboratory and imaging facilities, a community health outreach programme, an organic farming initiative and a craft initiative which aims to revive traditional Lambadi embroidery. Hospital has modern facilities like an advanced Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a dental clinic, a labour room, a neo-natal room, an emergency room and a fully functional laboratory. The project started off with their savings inside a mud and brick hut from where Dr. Regi and Dr. Lalitha ran an out patient clinic in the mornings where they settled along with their three-year-old son and an engineer friend.

Mike Nied from Idolator wrote that Gomez \"sings over simmering beats\" while she \"celebrates her perseverance after a devastating breakup\". It is made up of 1980s electro-disco synths and sees Gomez praising her new boyfriend while mocking her ex. At the pre-chorus, she sings \"The old me's gone and I feel brand new, and if you don't like it, fuck you\", which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, \"I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl\". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a \"more 'Euro-glamorous' version\" of her previous alter ego \"Xtina\", featured in her 2002 hit \"Dirrty\" from Stripped.

This native rate is constantly modified by the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers via the autonomic nervous system, so that the average resting cardiac rate in adult humans is about 70 beats per minute. Because the sinoatrial node is responsible for the rest of the heart's electrical activity, it is sometimes called the primary pacemaker. What is a cardiac arrhytmia? How to diagnose an arrhythmia? There is an interatrial and an intraventricular septum. During this process the tricuspid valve shuts preventing the blood from coming back into the right atria and the closure of the pulmonary valve (located in the trunk of the pulmonary artery) from coming back to the right ventricle. As the left atrium contracts, the blood is pushed through the mitral valve located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The atria and the ventricles work together in an orderly and rhythmic manner, contracting and relaxing alternatively to pump the blood through the heart to the lungs and to all the tissues of the body. The heart beats 24 hours a day at a frequency of 50-70 bpm and pumps around 5 litres of blood per minute. The contraction of the cardiac muscle tissue (atria or ventricles) is called systole. When the ventricles contract, they pump the blood from their chambers into the arteries, the pulmonary artery the right ventricle and the aorta the left ventricle. The relaxation of the cardiac muscle tissue is called diastole. When the ventricles relax, they make room to accept the blood from the atria. Normally, heart beats are generated in a small structure located in the upper right chamber (right atrium) of the heart, the so-called sino-atrial node. These cells beat spontaneously fire (60-80 times per minute, bpm) and send an organized electrical signal through the heart that results in a coordinated and rhythmic heart beat (Figura 1). The cardiac impulses generated in the sino-atrial nodal cells propagate through the right and left atria at an speed of 0.5 meters/second (m/sec). After 30-50 miliseconds, the impulses reach the atrio-ventricular (AV) node. This is the only pathway that under normal conditions allows the impulses to travel from the atria to the ventricles. The cardiac impulse spreads rapidly through the His- Purkinje system (2-4 m/sec) and the ventricular muscle (0.3 to 1 m / s). The heart has four valves which control the blow flow there through. The atrioventricular valves prevent backflow from the ventricles into the atrium during systole. They are anchored to the wall of the ventricle by chordae tendineae, which prevent the valve from inverting. The mitral (bicuspid) valve allows oxygen-rich blood coming from the lungs pass from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to pass from the left ventricle into the aorta, which is the artery that distributes blood to the rest of the body. This means that the valves thicken and calcify narrowing the hole through which passes the blood. This forces the heart to generate more pressure on the chamber which is above the stenosed valve to push blood through the obstruction. Under normal conditions, the heart contracts rhythmically and regularly at a frequency between 50 and 70 beats per minute (bpm). This means that the heart beats (contracts) between 86,400 and 115,200 times a day. However, the rate at which the heart beats varies throughout the day, so that it decreases at rest or during sleep and is accelerated when performing an exercise or in situations of anxiety, emotion, fever or fear. Furthermore, in healthy people, or the elderly, may have a rate < 50 bpm and in trained athletes and young adults at rest or at night heart rate can be reduced to 30-40 bpm. On the contrary, when a person is performing regular physical activity (such as walking or driving), the heart beats within a normal range, i.e. between 60 and 100 beats per minute. A cardiac arrhythmia indicates an irregular heart beat. Thus, a cardiac arrhythmia is a disorder of the rate at which the heart beats. Bradycardia or bradyarrhythmias, when the heart rate is slow and the heart beats at a rate of less than 60 bpm. These arrhythmias are the most dangerous and may endanger the patient's life, as almost always affect the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. Sometimes, the heart generates a premature or extra beat that we call\"extrasystole\". Indeed, cardiac arrhythmias occur very frequently in patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure or hypertension. Other times, arrhythmias occur in patients with congenital heart defects, i.e., they born with this problem. Occasionally, other non-cardiac diseases can associate with the presence of cardiac arrhythmias. This is the case for hypo/hyperthyroidism, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or sleep apnea. Stress, caffeine, snuff, alcohol and some drugs sold over-the-counter to treat minor diseases processes (cough or cold symptoms) can alter the normal frequency of the heartbeat. It is very useful for the diagnosis of occasional cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in the general population and often they occur in patients affected with common cardiovascular diseases, such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure or arterial hypertension. The symptoms are highly variable, depending on the type, frequency and duration of the arrhythmia and on the presence or absence of an structural heart disease or other comorbidities of the patient. On the contrary, arrhythmias sometimes produce symptoms even at rest, and require aggressive treatment because of the risk of which can lead to sudden death of the patient. Generally, there is a good correlation between the severity of symptoms and the severity of the arrhythmia. Therefore, it is recommended that all people who detect an abnormal pulse or heart rate to consult the cardiologist or their doctor. The electrocardiogram allows them to detect quickly and easily the heart rhythm disturbances. These disorganized waves conduct intermittently through the atrioventricular node, leading to irregular activation of the ventricles that generate the heartbeat. The rate at which these impulses fire controls the rate of cardiac contraction, that is, the heart rate. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

These bands combine elements of the metal genres from the '70s and '80s, especially those of the N.W.O.B.H.M., although some bands are also influenced from genres such as speed metal, power metal and hard rock, doom metal and thrash metal. The movement's revival of this style helped to redefine the term \"heavy metal\", drawing its meaning back to the origins of the genre and its original sound after years of heavy influence from other genres and evolution of the style away from its roots. The movement continues to grow, although it has not achieved the same commercial success as the genres it seeks to revive. Their use of slow tempos was notable at a time when NWOBHM and thrash metal bands were increasingly incorporating fast-picking and speed into their songwriting. Each genre experienced a fragmentation of styles at this time, and many metal bands from the new wave of British heavy metal – most notably Iron Maiden – onwards displayed progressive rock influences. Progressive metal reached a point of maturity with Queensrÿche's 1988 concept album Operation: Mindcrime, Voivod's 1989 Nothingface, which featured abstract lyrics and a King Crimson-like texture, and Dream Theater's 1992 Images and Words. Black metal is conceptual by definition, due to its prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity. Its guttural vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as progressive, such as Mastodon, Mudvayne and Opeth. Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

According to the Academy of Medical Psychology, medical or medical health psychology is a specialized area of service devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of a number of behavioral challenges and mental disorders. Areas of clinical practice and research may also examine the effects of caffeine and nicotine, organ transplants or trauma on patients or focus on genetics or neuropsychology. As a clinical psychologist, you may engage in cognitive behavioral, individual or family therapy, or help patients acquire skills in pain management (www.amphome.org). Areas of specialization associated with clinical psychology include psychopharmacology, psychotherapy and psychophysiology. You might also choose to focus on biopsychosocial modeling and social psychology. Nationwide, employment of clinical, counseling and school psychologists overall was expected to increase by an average rate of 11% between 2012 and 2022, as noted by the BLS (www.bls.gov). How Can I Work in Medical Health Psychology? The minimum educational requirement for medical psychologists is completion of a doctoral program, which can lead to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Clinical Psychology or Medical Psychology or a Ph.D. in Psychology (Psych.D.). In general, the programs can take approximately five years to complete and are designed to prepare students for careers in education or research, or as practicing clinical psychologists in health care settings. Once enrolled, students take courses in assessment and interventions, biology, general psychology and methodology. In particular, they may study developmental and social psychology, ethics, psychopharmacology and statistics. They'll also learn how to conduct clinical interviews and personality assessments. Students also participate in practicums and a supervised internship, through which they learn how to diagnose and treat patients and become familiar with intervention techniques. Some aspiring medical psychologists pursue post-doctoral fellowships or training programs specific to the field. Although each program is different, areas of specialization can include clinical child or clinical health psychology; some professionals may specialize in clinical neuropsychology. All 50 states and Washington D.C. require clinical or counseling psychologists employed as independent practitioners to have a license. Individuals who use the term 'psychologist' as a professional title must also have a certification or license.

Abram L. Sachar, an American historian and founding president of Brandeis University, wrote that \"the genocide was cited approvingly twenty-five years later by the Fuehrer... who found the Armenian 'solution' an instructive precedent\". According to historian Stefan Ihrig, there is considerable evidence that Nazi worldview was shaped by the Turkish revolution and getting away with genocide. Tensions stemming from the Armenian Genocide, the systematic murder of an estimated 1,500,000 Armenians by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, are a bitter point of contention, with most historians defining the killings as a genocide, a term whose applicability the Turkish state rejects. Most historians maintain that it was a deliberate and intentional attempt to exterminate the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire.

Viewers of the image disagreed on whether the dress depicted was coloured black and blue, or white and gold. The phenomenon originated from a washed-out colour photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Facebook. Within a week, more than ten million tweets had mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold, and #blackandblue. The dress was identified as a product of the retailer Roman Originals, which experienced a major surge in sales of the dress as a result of the incident. The retailer produced a one-off version of the dress in white and gold as part of a charity campaign.

In 1887, he discovered a bacterium, now called Brucella, that caused what was known as Malta fever. In 1894, he discovered a protozoan parasite, named Trypanosoma brucei, as the causative pathogen of nagana (animal trypanosomiasis). Working in the Army Medical Services and the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bruce's major scientific collaborator was his microbiologist wife Mary Elizabeth Bruce (née Steele), with whom he published around thirty technical papers out of his 172 papers. Later, with his wife, he investigated an outbreak of animal disease called nagana in Zululand and discovered the protozoan parasite responsible for it. The bacterium, Brucella, and the disease it caused, brucellosis, along with the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, are named in his honour. Biography\n\nEarly life and education\nBruce was born in Melbourne, Australia, to Scottish parents, engineer David Bruce (from Airth) and his wife Jane Russell Hamilton (from Stirling), who had emigrated to Australia in the gold rush of 1850. He was an only child. He returned with his family to Scotland at the age of five. However, a bout of pneumonia forced him to abandon this and re-assess his career. He passed the military examination in 1883 and joined the Army Medical Services (in which he served until 1919). Bruce was appointed Assistant Professor of pathology at the Army Medical School in Netley in 1889, and served there for five years. He was assigned to investigate the case of cattle and horse sickness (called nagana) in Zululand. In 1899, Bruce was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. In 1900, he joined the army commission investigating dysentery in military camps, at the same time working for the Royal Society's Sleeping Sickness Commission. Bruce served as a member of the Army Medical Service Advisory Board from 1902 to 1911. Both were cremated in London and their ashes are buried together in Valley Cemetery in Stirling, close to Stirling Castle, beneath a simple stone cross on the east side of the main north–south path, near the southern roundel. They had no children. Scientific contributions\n\nMalta fever \nAt the time of Bruce's service in Malta, British soldiers suffered an outbreak of what was called the Malta fever. The genus Micrococcus was changed to Brucella in honour of Bruce and is accepted as a valid name. Accordingly, the disease has been renamed brucellosis. The fly disease and sleeping sickness \nWhen Bruce was transferred to South Africa, he was sent to Zululand to investigate the outbreak of animal disease which the natives called nagana, and the Europeans, the fly disease. Led by George Carmichael Low from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the team included his colleague Aldo Castellani and Cuthbert Christy, a medical officer on duty in Bombay, India. The second Commission in 1902 was entrusted to Bruce, assisted by David Nunes Nabarro from the University College Hospital. In the third Commission (1908–1912) Bruce and his colleagues established the complete developmental stages of the trypanosome in tsetse fly. Honours and awards\n\nBruce was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1899. He served as editor of the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps between 1904 and 1908. Bruce's name features on the frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

His parents Alfred Fuchs and Paula Hacker came from Vienna, Austria, and settled in Manhattan's Washington Heights, then home to many Germans-speakers. In 1924, he graduated from City College with a BS in social sciences. In 1928, he graduated with a JD degree in law from New York University. He was born on June 18, 1906, in Port Washington, Nassau County, New York. Ralph Barton was the youngest of four children born to Abraham Pool and Catherine Josephine (Wigginton) Barton. His father was an attorney by profession, but around the time of Ralph's birth made a career change to publish journals on metaphysics. Buoyed by this success, in 1908 Ralph Barton dropped out of Kansas City's Westport High School before graduating. To address his substance abuse, Ralph took several steps. This step allowed him to remove himself from an environment that could potentially trigger his substance abuse. Additionally, Ralph attended group therapy sessions to seek support and guidance in his journey towards recovery. Furthermore, Ralph sought the help of a sponsor and a \"buddy,\" who were there to offer him additional support and serve as a source of accountability. Importantly, Ralph made efforts to reduce his substance use gradually. He also managed to reduce his drinking to \"a few beers\" at parties. As a result of these steps and his determination, Ralph experienced improvements in various aspects of his life. Overall, Ralph's steps to address his substance abuse included cutting ties with negative influences, attending group therapy, seeking the support of a sponsor and a buddy, gradually reducing his substance use, and being open to further treatment options in the future if needed.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Since the time of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, his personage has always been a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions. Over the years, the Dalai Lama visited Vancouver several times, in 1980, 1993, 2004, 2006 and 2009.

In the wake of the takeover and especially during the cultural revolution many monasteries were destroyed and many monks and laypeople killed. The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current Dalai Lama has attempted to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for greater autonomy and religious freedom for Tibet. In an effort to control this, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a Reincarnation Application be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate. The present incarnation of the Panchen Lama is disputed. The Dalai Lama recognises Gedhun Choekyi Nyima; however, the Chinese government recognises Gyaincain Norbu as the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama. The identity of the Panchen Lama is of critical importance to Tibetan Buddhism because he is one of the authorities that must approve the next Dalai Lama.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

She briefly comments about Bolivar's laziness and moves on, then the kittens emerge and lovingly nuzzle Bolivar. Baths may also soothe the pain of the open sores, bringing some relief to the cat. While prognosis is linked to the specific diagnosis and severity of the condition, most cats enjoy a long life with autoimmune skin disease. Treatment will be ongoing, as there is no cure. The problem with feral cats is that there is no history and we are not sure what they get up to during the day. Without an examination and cleaning, it is hard to say for sure the cause; you could try the same treatment as last year and continue to try to trap him. It is not a systemic disorder. Enforced rest and a protein-restricted diet are hallmarks of initial treatment. Your veterinarian will decide upon the appropriate medical protocol for your cat. Supportive care, enforced rest and dietary restrictions are important components of treatment. In most cases, treatment or more accurately, management of SLE must be continued for life, although doses of medication can be tapered if remission occurs. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy has adverse side effects that must be taken into account when designing a treatment protocol for cats with SLE. These include bone marrow suppression and increased risk of localized or systemic infection, such as bronchopneumonia or urinary tract infections, among other things. There is no surgical option. Affected animals should not be bred. Given its unpredictable and progressive course, the prognosis for cats with SLE is guarded to poor. Like SLE, discoid lupus erythematosus cannot be cured. I know in humans a healthy diet and exercise is a must but what do you do for a cat? Our cat has the same thing. His immune system is killing the blood cells. My kittens platelets are destroying themselves. Our cat has an autoimmune disease as well but is the friendliest cat ever.

Poor thing had to be taken away from his mother and bottle fed. So sorry to hear about Samwise. Now working on his immune system, which by the way I diagnosed in the end. Which is a sure sign of Pemphigus. Two vets have told me consider the ugly alternative. All I needed to do was work on his immune system! Hi Helena, we just rescued an orphaned kitten over a month ago and vet tells me she has an autoimmune issue which looks like Pemphigus also. The most common autoimmune skin disease in cats is called Pemphigus Complex.

It was disputed whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) could achieve the spiritual liberation of a male mendicant (sadhu) through asceticism. The major Jain traditions have disagreed, with Digambaras (the sky-clad, naked mendicant order) believing that a woman is unable to fully practice asceticism and cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender; she can, at best, live an ethical life so she is reborn as a man. According to this view, women are seen as a threat to a monk's chastity. Mahavira had preached about men and women equality. The clothes-wearing Svetambaras have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant, ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation). He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters. One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The new alignment would conflict less with development, provide a straighter route, avoid the need for a pedestrian crossing and a lengthy pedestrian tunnel at Chinatown, and move the Boylston loop away from the Burying Ground. In January 2002, the MBTA began seeking federal funding for 60% of the project cost. These grade-separated railways would add transportation capacity, and avoid delays caused by intersections with cross streets and growing congestion in mixed street traffic. The West End Street Railway was renamed the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy), and undertook several such projects. Boston's subway was the first in the United States and is often called \"America's First Subway\" by the MBTA and others. In 1897 and 1898, the Tremont Street subway opened as the core of the precursor to the Green Line. Capital cost was originally estimated at $768–812 million depending on the portal location; completion was moved from 2010 to 2013. In August 2005, the MBTA put the Phase III project \"on hold\" in order to build community consensus on a locally preferred routing.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The term \"Colombiana\" means a woman from Colombia. The film is about Cataleya (named for a genus of orchids), a nine-year-old girl in Colombia whose family is killed by a drug lord. Christy Lemire of The Associated Press reviewed Colombiana, writing that \"The director of La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element serves as co-writer and producer here, but this is very much a spin-off of his brand, a continuation of the kind of stereotype- and gravity-defying characters he's made his name on. Colombiana feels more hammy and muscular, though – but knowingly so, and that's what makes it solid, late-summer escapist \n\n Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"This B-movie blast of bloody blam blam is the latest chapter in the Luc Besson book of badly bruised lovelies who are better not crossed. What he began in 1990 with Nikita followed with Léon in '94 and '97's The Fifth Element, (the last written with Robert Mark Kamen, who co-wrote Colombiana with Besson), he refines in Colombiana.\" At the 2015 CineEurope, when the production house EuropaCorp announced upcoming films, it mentioned that Colombiana 2 was in development. While Saldana responded to an interviewer, in 2017, that she wouldn't mind reprising her role as Cataleya, as of early 2019 there has been no further news from EuropaCorp to suggest a sequel is forthcoming. The script for Colombiana was based on Mathilda, which was originally written by Luc Besson as a sequel to Léon: The Professional. David Martin-Jones, who wrote the article \"Colombiana: Europa Corp and the Ambiguous Geopolitics of the Action Movie,\" stated that the film was likely to have been perceived by audiences to be an American Hollywood production since it \"disguises its national origin to appeal to mainstream audiences\"; he added that the trait of \"aping the look of a Hollywood genre film, with a non-US twist\" had been used in previous European films.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The uplift of the area and then the erosion of the limestone layer created today's massive cavern system. The system spreads out in limestones and dolomite of Carboniferous and Permian age. Fossilized footprints of dinosaurs and the crocodile-like tritylodonts can be found in this 350 foot (107 m) thick ledgy-slope forming formation, called the Kayenta. The Kayenta weathers into three units; a lower ledge and middle cliff that are dominated by cross-bedded sandstone and an upper slope that has relatively more siltstone. One place where the contact is easiest to discern is west of State Route 24 along the Fremont River at mile marker 82. A massive Sahara-like desert geologists call an erg then invaded the area, covering it with 800 to 1,100 \n\n  Mesas form by weathering and erosion of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by tectonic activity. This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert, limestone, lava flows and sills.

Revelation of the Quran is described as being \"sent down\" in verse It is also called kalam allah — the word of God — and to most Muslims is eternal and uncreated attribute of God, as opposed to something written or created by God. Commonly, Injil and the Islamic notion of Torah are thought to be part of the Heavenly Quran. The idea of a holy book or other religious totem being based on an archetype preserved in heaven is not unique to Islam but goes back \"thousands of years\" to \"the early Summerians\" according to Alfred Guillaume. In Islam, the Quran is considered a revelation given to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. In Islamic tradition, Quran 42:51 serves as the basis of understanding for Waḥy. The copy of the Quran is traditionally considered to be one of a group commissioned by the third caliph Uthman; however, this attribution has been questioned. According to Islamic tradition, in 651, 19 years after the death of the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad, Uthman commissioned a committee to produce a standard copy of the text of the Quran (see Origin and development of the Quran). Five of these authoritative Qurans were sent to the major Muslim cities of the era, and Uthman kept one for his own use in Medina, although the Samarkand Quran is most likely not one of those copies.

The hypothalamus is responsible for controlling body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and the sleep/wake cycle. Additionally, the hypothalamus regulates the metabolic rate, which determines how quickly we utilize energy from the calories we consume. The hypothalamus receives signals from various sources, including the autonomic nervous system, emotional limbic nerve centers, frontal cortex, and reptilian brain. However, while the hypothalamus acts as the engine of homeostasis, it is not the sole driver. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, thirst, hunger, eating, water balance, and the libido. For example, if body temperature increases, the hypothalamus triggers mechanisms like sweating and vasodilation to dissipate heat and cool the body down. Additionally, the hypothalamus controls the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland, which helps regulate water balance and prevent dehydration. This way, the hypothalamus helps maintain a balanced and healthy diet. Furthermore, the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of the libido and sexual behavior. Overall, the hypothalamus contributes to maintaining homeostasis through its involvement in various physiological processes. Through its control over important bodily functions like temperature regulation, fluid balance, hunger, and sexual behavior, the hypothalamus helps ensure that the body's internal environment remains stable and within normal limits. The hypothalamus plays various functions and roles in the human body. One of the important functions of the hypothalamus is its role in maintaining the body's circadian rhythms. The hypothalamus receives signals from the retina and helps regulate the sleep-wake cycles by influencing the production of melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland. The hypothalamus is also intimately involved in sexual development and puberty. Additionally, the hypothalamus has been associated with sexual orientation, although the biological evidence is still under investigation and further research is needed to fully understand its implications. Furthermore, the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, which controls activities such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and respiration. In addition, the hypothalamus plays a role in body temperature regulation. In summary, the hypothalamus is a vital structure in the brain that regulates a wide range of functions in the human body, including circadian rhythms, sexual development, autonomic nervous system control, body temperature regulation, and hormone release.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

When comparing the lack of \"moral argument\" in Blood Meridian to the heightened morality present in No Country for Old Men, he considered stating that the \"apocalyptic moral judgments\" made in No Country for Old Men represented \"a sort of falling away on McCarthy's part\". The novel has received a significant amount of critical attention, for example, Lynnea Chapman King, Rick Wallach and Jim Welsh's edited collection No Country for Old Men: From Novel to Film or Raymond Malewitz's \"Anything Can Be an Instrument: Misuse Value and Rugged Consumerism in Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men.\" Hill says he originally wrote the film intending to cast a younger actor, like Jan Michael Vincent, and that he wanted Warren Oates to play Coburn's role. According to Hill, \"they had offered it to a couple of actors and they didn't want to do it.\" Then it was sent to Charles Bronson even though Hill thought he was \"too old\". A day later, Bronson's agent called back and said Bronson had read the script and wanted to do the film \"but he had to meet me. Hill remembers that Bronson \"was in remarkable physical condition for a guy his age; I think he was about 52 at the time. His one problem was that he was a smoker, so he didn't have a lot of stamina. I mean, he probably could have kicked anybody's ass on that movie, but he couldn't fight much longer than 30 or 40 seconds.\" Hill later said Bronson received \"very close to a million\" dollars for his role.

In 1980, while hunting pronghorns, Llewelyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone awry that has left everyone dead, save a sole badly wounded Mexican who pleads with Moss for water. Moss responds that he does not have any and searches the rest of the vehicles, finding a truck full of heroin. He searches for the \"last man standing\" and \n\nSix medical professionals joined The Topeka Capital-Journal in a roundtable discussion to tackle the complex, challenging and positive things happening in health care. Participants were Jackie Hyland, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus and an anesthesiologist; James Owen, a radiologist affiliated with St. Francis; Eric Voth, vice president of primary care services at Stormont Vail Health and an internal medicine physician; Clifton Jones, Stormont's vice president of subspecialty care and an infectious disease specialist; Doug Iliff, a private practice physician with Iliff Family Practice; and Michelle Meier, chief operating officer for Kansas Medical Clinic PA. But the approach has challenges in and of itself. It's like there's an inexhaustible supply of very ill people,\" Jones said. That's what I worry about.\" \"The fact is, if you look at a lot of the health care problems, they're not ones that we can have. \"But even the ones who have medication, you can't get 'em to take it. \"You know, honestly, if you think about it, it might be the physician who doesn't take the time and check the boxes and print the sheet who's giving a better education to that patient. I think the education needs to change.\" \"One of the things I find most disturbing, not just here but nationally, too, is this has become such a political hot potato. Both sides need to come together to say, ‘Let's figure out how in the heck to fix this,' rather than you and you, and good guy and bad guy, and Republican and Democrat. \"The whole Medicaid expansion thing is a perfect example. Would we have walked away from $2 billion of Department of Defense money or highway monies or anywhere else? This was $2 billion worth of fairy dust that could have been sprinkled on Kansas, and now it's jeopardized nationally.\" \"They shut down the state hospital, and those people didn't just vanish. Is behavioral health care a primary consideration in Topeka? As a group, the six answered, \"Absolutely.\" What's something positive in medicine right now? Hyland: Telemedicine. But right now, the EMR is a bit of a pain. \"She said this is supposed to tell a story, and she was grading down my doctor's notes. As they went through and hit all the points — they'd actually hit all the right points and they could show that — but she's an outsider trying to read it, and she can't find the story,\" Meier said. Voth said Stormont is considering the use of scribes, which has been something of a national trend. Hyland rose in defense of EMR and it's potential, even as the system works through the kinks now. \"Right now, I agree with everyone. \"I can get all their numbers in the right place with really cheap stuff.\" I give 'em pills and make 'em better. They know what I think. Nutrition, diet, smoking — all the factors that feed into the top health issues in the state. \"One thing I'm on a personal rant about is the cost of pharmaceuticals,\" Voth said. \"It's staggering. Staggering. And you know, companies need to make a profit, I understand that. But this is a killing. That's ridiculous. That is absolutely criminal, and nobody's standing in the way of that. There's a lot of things that could be done.\" Heads nodded around the table. And aren't there shortages are some of the cheap drugs, sometimes because they aren't as profitable? \"Narcan for opiates. Narcan used to be dirt cheap. \"Inexcusable.\" \"All of this stuff could be fixed by our congressmen.\" \"I would have kept the family practice residency in Topeka,\" Hyland said immediately. \"I'm nostalgic for the days when I was a young doctor and physicians interacted on a regular basis and worked in the same places and saw each other frequently,\" Jones said. … Everybody is siloed now. \"Right now, it's a mess.\" In 2007, Joel and Ethan Coen adapted the book into a film, also titled No Country for Old Men, which was met with critical acclaim and box office success.

The play is divided into four acts, covering Macmillan's early life and military experience in World War I; his involvement in British politics during the descent into World War II; the Suez Crisis, during which he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; and his service as Prime Minister, during which the reputation of his government was severely damaged by the Profumo affair. Eisenhower had repeatedly warned London against any such action, and feared a collapse of Western influence in the region. British post-war debt was so large that economic sanctions could have caused a devaluation of sterling. Anthony Eden soon resigned as prime minister, leaving office with a ruined reputation. However, the new prime minister Harold Macmillan (1957–1963) restored good terms with Eisenhower and President John F. Kennedy (1961–1963). Intimacy and warmth characterized his relationship with the latter who appointed David K. E. Bruce as ambassador. Although the role was not in Macmillan's cabinet and rather low in the formal priorities, it had a higher public profile than this situation would suggest. During the Second World War, he served in a balloon squadron in the Royal Air Force and briefly held office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in the 1945 caretaker government. Kerr was made a Baronet, of Cambridge in the County of Cambridge, in 1957. The title became extinct upon his death in 1974. Eden resigned in the wake of the Suez Crisis, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister on 10 January. He brought the economic concerns of the exchequer into the premiership, but his approach to the economy was to seek high employment; whereas his treasury ministers argued that to support the Bretton-Wood's requirement on the pound sterling would require strict control of the money base, and hence a rise in unemployment. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'. Macmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Getting to the Heart of the Problem: What is the Cost of Saving a Life? 2018 Aug 9;379(6):524-534. Take Home Message: Cardiac screening can identify some high-risk athletes, but no screening strategy is likely to be perfect. This debate is impaired by the lack of systematic registries, which could help estimate the incidence of sudden death and impact of screening. The incidence of sudden cardiac death among previously screened athletes was ~6.8 per 100,00 athletes, which is higher than previous estimates. Out of the 267 athletes that had any cardiac condition only 6 were picked up by history, and 76 were picked up by examination alone. This study is a nice reminder that screening can identify some high-risk athletes, but no screening strategy is likely to be perfect. Even if a league or school opts out of a screening program it may be beneficial for medical professionals to offer enough information for parents/athletes to make an informed decision about whether they want to independently pursue cardiac screening. Questions for Discussion: How confident are you that your preseason health screening is effective at finding cardiac abnormalities? The college I attend issues a referral for an ECG or echocardiogram if they are flagged during the history collection. After speaking with the one of the college's Athletic Trainers, they have found a relationship between physical's that are not done my the medical director or campus physician and incident rate. It may be an important policy of the school to only accept physical's done my a certain physician or by the college or university itself. Additionally, many school's, institutions, and programs use their own PPE form, which may not have all of the relevant questions that would help to ascertain any red flags for further testing. When I was reading through, it reminded me of a case that occurred at my college. The college I attend actually offers cardiac screenings to all student athletes, or at least has offered that in the past. Had this defect gone undetected, it could have led to sudden cardiac death. Unfortunately, I was the small percentage that was found to be diagnosed with a false positive. But what if the student does not have insurance to cover this type of screening? Therefore, this brings up the debate on what the cost is of saving a life. Thank you for sharing your cases. I think this is a cause for concern.

She was a half-sister of the blues singer Bessie Smith (Bessie's mother, Laura, née Owens, married Mary's father). She performed as a chorus girl in Memphis, Tennessee, and in various minstrel shows during the 1920s and 1930s, including Irvin C. Miller's Brown Skin Models, the Davis S. Bell Medicine Show, and F. S. Wolcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.

During the marriage, Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female sex partners for Bessie. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, Gertrude Saunders, Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce. Smith later entered a common-law marriage with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was Lionel Hampton's uncle.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers. Hidden Markov Models were first applied to speech recognition by James K. Baker in 1975. Continuous speech recognition occurs by the following steps, modeled by a HMM. Feature analysis is first undertaken on temporal and/or spectral features of the speech signal. The feature is then compared to all sequences of the speech recognition units. Similar to the lexicon decoding, the system path is further constrained by the rules of grammar and syntax. In the last decade, there have been significant advancements in speech technology, largely due to new machine learning paradigms. Some key areas of progress in speech technology include:\n\n1. Speech production and auditory perception: New machine learning paradigms have enabled better understanding and modeling of the human speech production system and how it is perceived by the auditory system. This has improved the accuracy and naturalness of speech synthesis systems. This has led to advancements in speech recognition systems and language processing algorithms. Speech recognition: Machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and neural networks, have significantly improved speech recognition accuracy. These algorithms can learn from large amounts of speech data and extract relevant features, leading to better performance in tasks such as phoneme recognition and keyword spotting. Spoken dialogue systems: Machine learning has played a crucial role in the development of spoken dialogue systems, enabling more intelligent and interactive conversations between humans and machines. These systems utilize natural language processing techniques and dialogue management algorithms to provide a more user-friendly and personalized experience. In summary, new machine learning paradigms have revolutionized speech technology in the last decade by enabling advancements in speech production, auditory perception, cognitive understanding, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and spoken dialogue systems. These developments have enhanced the accuracy, naturalness, and usability of speech technologies, leading to their widespread adoption in various applications.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Geochemical evidence has indicated that there was a first step-increase in the oxygenation of the Earth's surface, which is known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), in the early Paleoproterozoic (2,500–1,600 Mya). A second but much steeper increase in oxygen levels, known as the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE), occurred at around 800 to 500 Mya. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the potential energy of their collisions and in-falling as heat. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid. The outward acceleration caused by Earth's rotation is greater at the \n\nThe chemical evolution of the Earth's early atmosphere was influenced by several key factors. Astronomical, geochemical, and atmospheric processes each played a role in the development and evolution of the gaseous envelope around the Earth. This process, known as chemical evolution, eventually gave rise to the first living systems on our planet. These organisms had the ability to transform carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, releasing molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product. This oxygen production had a significant impact on the atmosphere. Atmospheric oxygen, in turn, photochemically formed ozone (O3), which absorbed ultraviolet radiation from the sun and provided protection for life on Earth. The increase in atmospheric ozone levels allowed life to transition from the oceans to land for the first time. Throughout the history of our planet, there has been a strong interaction between life and the atmosphere.

Bowen was chosen as a prospect due to the financing of $500,000 by the Queensland Government. The production moved to Bowen on 14 May 2007; the town was used to depict 1940's Darwin. The film was shot in Townsville, Queensland and its surrounding areas. The series cost A$6.2 million to produce, with half the budget provided by the Film Finance Corporation Australia. The film's five-week shoot began on 12 October 2009 in Queensland's Hervey Bay, Fraser Island and Bowen Bay, with additional shark footage completed in South Australia.

The track \n\n Bad Romance (Alt. Its English-language title was based on the song \"Bad Romance\", by singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. It was written and directed by first-time filmmaker François Chang, who has taken the essence of the song to create a story focussing on seven lonely individuals whose lives could be transformed after experiencing love at first sight. It has musical influence of 1990s style rapping, and contains two samples from the 1969 song \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" by the band Steam, and the 1987 song, \"Top Billin'\", by Audio Two. Some praised Wale and Gaga's collaboration and composition, while others criticized it. A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011, co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus. It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene. It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus, and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death.

There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise. The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization. Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs. After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands. Respiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. After long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms. The build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. The muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity. Aerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction. All of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery. Chronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. It's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume. Reference:\n- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/\n\n Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an \n\nThe main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. One of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

It follows the story of James \"Jim\" Lake Jr., a teenage boy who finds a mysterious amulet and stumbles across a secret realm inhabited by trolls and other magical creatures. It was produced by Guillermo del Toro's Double Dare You alongside DreamWorks Animation for Netflix, with del Toro, Marc Guggenheim, Aaron Waltke, Chad Quandt, and Chad Hammes serving as executive producers. Waltke and Quandt served as head writers and co-showrunners. DreamWorks Animation optioned the book to develop as an animated feature film, to be directed by Guillermo del Toro and Rodrigo Blaas. Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series.

The band initially consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty; his brother, rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty; bassist Stu Cook; and drummer Doug Clifford. These members had played together since 1959, first as the Blue Velvets and later as the Golliwogs, before settling on the Creedence Clearwater Revival name in 1967. Belying their origins in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, the band often played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics \n\n By the fall of 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival was one of the hottest rock bands in the world, having scored three consecutive #2 singles and the #1 album Green River. Bandleader and songwriter John Fogerty had assumed control of the band after several years of futility, but, despite their growing success, the other members – bassist Stu Cook, drummer Doug Clifford and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John's older brother – began to chafe under Fogerty's demanding, autocratic leadership. \"That was a bit of overkill and I never \n\n After ten years of struggling as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, singer/guitarist John Fogerty, his brother guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford scored a No. 11 hit single with \"Susie Q\" in June 1968 under the name Creedence Clearwater Revival. Despite their new-found success, however, seeds of discontent among the four members had already been planted due to John Fogerty assuming control of the band at just about every level. The band's single-mindedness and work ethic drew the ire of some other San Francisco-based bands, with drummer Doug Clifford recalling to Jeb Wright of Goldmine in 2013, \"We went to see the local bands and they were so stoned they weren’t even in tune and they were really terrible...We made \n\n A Cash Box Magazine album review dated April 9, 1977, states \"It would be hard to follow the high quality work that Tom Fogerty put into Creedence Clearwater Revival but Fogerty's new band, Ruby, deserves more than a casual listen.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The plot revolves around a robotic revolt led by a robot named De Gaulle in the year 2199 AD. By the explosions of global nuclear war, society has broken up into nine small expulsions, one of them disappeared and Venus collided with another celestial object. The heroine is named Al Tiana and is also apparently a robot who does not support the rebellion. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace is a 1999 action-adventure role playing video game released by LucasArts and based on the film of the same title. The game is set in several different settings seen within the film, and contains heavy RPG elements alongside its largely adventurous action-oriented game world. More open-ended than the majority of 3D games at the time, the project was notably innovative for its decade. The game is set during the timeline of the film, with players taking on the role of Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and several other characters from the film. The game features open environments to explore at the player's leisure, and dozens of non-player characters with unique dialog. The game received praise for its role-playing-style gameplay, appealing graphics, and story, however, criticisms for its camera angles and voice acting were prevalent. The story unfolds via the introduction video, explanations of new technologies, videos obtained for completing secret projects, interludes, and cut-scenes. A voice intrudes into the player's dreams and soon waking moments, threatening more attacks if the industrial pollution and terraforming by the colonists is not reversed.

Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis. Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray. In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines. Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot. Spurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the \"bowstring-like\" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective. People who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on. Once a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months. Prevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis. It must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts. While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The northern rim of the South Wales Coalfield, focused on Merthyr, became Britain's foremost iron-producing district in the second half of the 18th century, while the south-western part of the coalfield, around Swansea, emerged as an important centre of non-ferrous metal smelting and tinplate production. However, coal mining for sale developed in earnest from the mid 19th century and this was to become the signature industry of the region, transforming the economic and social landscape of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the intense industrialisation of the coal mining valleys, many parts of the landscape of South Wales such as the upper Neath valley, the Vale of Glamorgan and the valleys of the River Usk and River Wye remain distinctly beautiful and unspoilt and have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Large areas of forestry and open moorland also contribute to the amenity of the landscape. Until 2015 coal was still mined at Hatfield, Kellingley and Thoresby Collieries, and is extracted at several very large opencast pits in South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere.

From his birth until the death of his oldest brother Francis, Dauphin of France (Francis I's eldest son), in 1536, Charles was known as the Duke of Angoulême. When Henry's elder brother and Dauphin, Francis, Duke of Brittany, died childless in 1536, Henry substituted him as Dauphin and ceded the title to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Angoulême, who died childless in 1545. The child duke, however, died one year later, and the title passed to his recently born brother Charles, who became King of France in 1560. He changed his name to Francis in honour of his late brother Francis II of France when he was confirmed. In 1574, following the death of his brother Charles IX of France and the accession of his other brother Henry III of France, he became heir to the throne. In 1576 he was made Duke of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry. predecessor's widow, Anne of Brittany, in order to retain that province for France.

The university moved out to a larger campus in the Haidian District when Mao established the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the Honglou is now a museum. Shortly after the university moved, Mao established the Central Academy of Drama, the only institution of higher education currently in the district. It is located on Dongmianhua Hutong, a short distance west of Nanluoguxiang. The Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School (PKU Shenzhen) is a public research university established as a satellite graduate school of Peking University in 2001 via a joint venture with the Shenzhen Municipal Government.

Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. Global warming affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and weather extremes (like storms and heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods; and changes in sea level. Global warming is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world. Global warming will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups, such as the poor. Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use. Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010. A range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture, and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector. Other major health risks associated with climate change include air and water quality. The study predicted that the country's GDP would drop, but that agricultural GDP would increase. In the long term, climate change was predicted to damage food security and cause a decrease in household GDP. Climate change is affecting food security. It has caused reduction in global mean yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010. Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops. The effects of warming on the oceans impact fish stocks, with a global decline in the maximum catch potential.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

A double lung transplant in 2009 saved her life from the ravages of the brutal lung disease, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). This profound event started her on a journey of gratitude for her donor and his or her family, her own family and the Queensland Lung Transplant Service, based in Brisbane. She is able to share her experiences with the disease as one of the original core of five volunteers involved in the Australian IPF Peer Support Program, conducted through the Lung Foundation Australia. This book is a tribute to all donor families across Australia who donate a loved one’s organs or tissues during a time of terrible sadness - the ultimate Gift of Life. My gratitude for my new life lies with my donor and his or her family, the team at the Queensland Lung Transplant Service at The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, and my family, including a little boy who wanted so desperately for his Nanny to have healthy new lungs. On day 11, the sun was never brighter, the sky bluer or the grass greener than when I was discharged from hospital and arrived home to start a journey of recovery and renewal. I celebrated my 63rd birthday 18 days later. The process of confronting my mortality has strengthened me. I was fortunate enough to escape this time around and it has made me very aware of the fragility of life. Our family all registered as organ donors following their deaths. Happily, she continues to be an inspiration to all who know her. Ironically, you make the decision to register as a donor on the basis that one day you may be able to give the gift of life. With this in mind, the Australian Government initiative, DonateLife, and the non-government Transplant Australia are doing a superb job promoting the cause of organ and tissue donation. You can discover the facts about organ and tissue donation and the need to discuss your choice with your family at www.donatelife.gov.au or www.transplant.org.au. I look on my lovely new lungs as being not just for myself. In reality I knew who the angels were: my donor and his or her family and the lung transplant team directed by Dr Peter Hopkins at The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane. I know I am lucky to be alive. And despite struggling for oxygen on that fateful night enroute to The Prince Charles Hospital, via ambulance with a paramedic holding one hand and a small teddy bear in the other, I can assure you I was spiritually rowing very strongly. Viviane (Ogier), the wife of the French consul in Melbourne, joins a group of explorers in search of a mysterious hidden valley in the bush of New Guinea, where she hopes to find the feathers of an extremely rare exotic bird. Along the way through the dense jungles of Papua New Guinea and on the peak of Mount Giluwe, she and the small group of explorers make contact with the Mapuga tribe, one of the most isolated groups of human beings on earth, who inspire them to explore their own humanity, unfettered by their own subjective ideas of \"civilization\". The search becomes a search for a paradise said to exist within a valley marked as \"obscured by cloud\" on the only map of the area available dated as surveyed in 1969. Based on the novel of the same name by Alan Marshall, the film is set in the early 1900s in a small town in the Western District of Victoria, centering around a young Alan Marshall and the people in his town.

It likely originated in this formulation in 1546, when The Proverbs of John Heywood claimed \"the moon is made of a greene cheese.\" In French, there is the proverb \"Il veut prendre la lune avec les dents\" (\"He wants to take the moon with his teeth\"), alluded to in Rabelais. Some examples of ophthalmic proverbs and aphorisms that can be used for ocular health promotion include:\n\n1. \"The eyes, like sentinels, hold the highest place in the body\" - This proverb emphasizes the importance of vision and highlights the significance of maintaining good eye health. \"Be gentle with two: women and eyes\" - This proverb emphasizes the need to be gentle and careful with our eyes. These proverbs and aphorisms can serve as valuable reminders to prioritize ocular health and promote healthy behaviors related to eye care. In its contemporary context it meant to be true (loyal, faithful, supportive) to one's own interests (the 'self' of person, property, and goals). Archaisms in proverbs are often retained, far longer than in other parts of the language. This is because they make the proverbs \"fall easier on the tongue\", and also because of the rhetorical effect they evoke by the use of two of the four fundamental operations in rhetoric. This is an example of an Ibanag proverb, that is also known throughout the archipelago. Translated to: He who does not look back into his past, cannot reach his destination. Translated to: In heaven there is no beer, that's why we drink it here. Huwag mong sabihing sisiw na ang itlog para Hindi ito maging bugok, . The use of proverbs is very apparent in the Kanuri religion of Islam where they are used to help with comprehension of social happenings and to teach the meanings of things. These proverbs are created by the wise old men with a point of view based on the situation and what lesson is trying to be taught. Proverbs will usually reference objects found in everyday life. However, the objects used in the proverbs are used in such a way that they teach social attitudes, beliefs or experiences. Often proverbs are built around necessary acts that are carried out in daily life, but made to be easily visualized and applied to other, more intense situations. Kanuri proverbs can be used as a way to scare or warn the people of foolish or dangerous acts, but can also be more light hearted and encouraging.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

It was the first Starrcade event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and it took place on December 26, 1988, from the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly before the event, Ted Turner bought Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), and the company became WCW. The main event was an over 30 minute bout between Ric Flair and Lex Luger for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Other matches included The Road Warriors against Sting and Dusty Rhodes for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, Barry Windham against Bam Bam Bigelow for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, and Mike Rotunda against Rick Steiner for the NWA World Television Championship. This event varied from other Starrcade events by only featuring the tournaments, only showcasing a small amount of wrestlers, and not featuring title defenses. The event led to a feud between Sting and Flair after a brief alliance as members of the Four Horsemen stable. The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines.

For his part in coming forward with the sexual assault allegations, Crews was named as one of the \"Silence Breakers\" from the Time Person of the Year award in 2017. The hashtag was initially first used in 2007 by Tarana Burke but was later popularized and brought to the attention of the media on October 15, 2017, when Alyssa Milano, using Twitter, encouraged individuals to speak up about their experience with assault and say 'Me Too'.

Floppy disks store digital data which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device. The first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM, had a disk diameter of 8 in. 3½-inch \n\n  The first floppy disk was 8 inches in diameter, was protected by a flexible plastic jacket and was a read-only device used by IBM as a way of loading microcode. Read/write floppy disks and their drives became available in 1972 but it was IBM's 1973 introduction of the 3740 data entry system that began the establishment of floppy disks, called by IBM the Diskette 1, as an industry standard for information interchange. Originally, the high-density mode for 3.5\" floppy drives in Japan only supported a capacity of 1.2 MB instead of the 1440 KB capacity that was used elsewhere. Some BIOSes have a configuration setting to enable this mode for floppy drives supporting it. A floppy-disk controller (FDC) is a special-purpose integrated circuit (IC or \"chip\") and associated disk controller circuitry that directs and controls reading from and writing to a computer's floppy disk drive (FDD).

During the country's civil war from 1960 to 1996, 200,000 people were killed and 45,000 forcibly disappeared. According to the Historical Clarification Commission, Guatemala's truth and reconciliation commission, the Guatemalan state (military and government paramilitaries) was responsible for over 90 percent of human rights abuses recorded there. 26,000 of these immigrants were Guatemalan. Following the 1950s, Guatemala had been full of unrest with military wars, civil wars, and a thirty six year long guerrilla war. In 1996, the Guatemalan government signed a peace accord. Thus, ending the war; however, the war did not end for many Guatemalans who had to live alongside those who inflicted \n\n No sector was more affected by violence during the years of the Guatemalan Civil War than the country's peasant population.

The 36 year Guatemalan civil war began in the early 1960s with a military rebellion by left-wing insurgency groups against the new regime.

The horse is usually locked in stables, in a box or a stall, when not in use by humans. The horse has very little room to move. This confining stable, often reinforced with grills, also deprives it of contact with its peers. According to the definition of equine welfare advocated by INRA and the Farm Animal Welfare Council, because life in a box or stall prevents the horse from expressing its normal behaviour, it constitutes a form of \n\nThis is a result partly of inheritance and partly of training, but it may affect the arrangement of the organs around it.The size varies with the size of the horse and its function; the heart of a thoroughbred is larger than that of a draft horse.• The heart is an irregular, laterally compressed cone with the larger part lying on the left of centre of the mediastinum and thoracic cavity.The position of the eyes on the head, the compressed shape of the eyeball and the weakness of the ciliary muscles means that the horse does not locate and focus images on the retina as readily as some predator species. This is not a problem for a prey species that does not need to catch its food; however, when a horse is being ridden and is expected to jump obstacles at speed it must be allowed to see the obstacle from a distance using its binocular facility. This explains why a horse may move its head up and down as it approaches the jump. This is a blood condition affecting neonatal foals. The maternal antibodies transferred via the colostrum attack the foal's erythrocytes and cause anaemia and jaundice. In severe cases this may result in the foal's death. A blood transfusion may be necessary and a gelding may be used as the blood donor. The size varies with the size of the horse and its function; the heart of a thoroughbred is larger than that of a draft horse. This is a result partly of inheritance and partly of training, but it may affect the arrangement of the organs around it.Apart from its size there is little to distinguish it from the canine or feline heart.The most common arrhythmia of the horse is atrial fibrillation, which is characterised by an increased resting heart rate.Horses diagnosed with this condition may be brought back to normal sinus rhythm by the use of quinidine sulphate. The circulatory system of the horse consists of the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. Anatomy\n\nHeart\nThe equine heart is a muscular pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The average adult horse has a  heart, although it can be more than twice this size. The heart grows until the horse is 4 years of age, although it can increase slightly in size as a response to conditioning. Heart size does not necessarily correlate to the size of the horse. The equine cardiovascular system is hugely compliant with a heart rate range from 20 to 240 beats per minute and a splenic red cell reserve able to double packed cell volume and oxygen delivery during maximal exercise. However, studies on Thoroughbreds have shown that the proportion of skeletal muscle exceeds 50% of body weight, and so the energetic capacity of the muscular system far exceeds the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen. The heart and blood vessels contain approximately  of blood in a  horse, which equates to about 76 ml/kg (1.2 oz/lb). Frog\n\nThe horse hoof contains a structural component known as the \"frog\", which covers the deeper structure of the hoof known as the digital cushion, a vessel-filled tissue. When the horse places weight on a leg, the ground pushes upward on the frog, compressing it and the underlying digital cushion. Depending on cardiovascular fitness and the horse's response to exercise, this drops significantly within 15–30 seconds after the horse stops galloping. A two-year-old horse may have a slightly faster pulse, and a 2–4-week-old foal normally has a pulse between 70 and 90 bpm. Blood pressure\nAlthough blood pressure may vary greatly between animals, the average blood pressure for a standing horse is 120/70 mmHg. Gums\nThe gums of the horse can offer good clues to its circulatory health.

Yellowish: a bright yellow tinge may occur if the horse has high levels of beta-carotene in its diet, such as horses that eat a good deal of alfalfa hay. If it takes longer for the gum color to return, the horse may be experiencing shock. However, the ability of the body to pump blood can help identify athletic potential in an unproven horse. There is a hypothesis that measurements of a horse's heart at rest are directly related to the same horse's cardiac function during exercise. Therefore, attempts have been made to take resting measurements of horses using an electrocardiograph (ECG). However, no work has correlated this to a horse's oxygen uptake (VO2Max) and the test has not been a good predictor of future athletic ability. There is also evidence that maximal oxygen consumption and heart size are more important predictors of performance for horses that run longer distances because their energy consumption is mainly aerobic. \"X factor\"\n\nThe X factor theory proposes that a mutation within a gene located on the X chromosome of horses causes a larger-than-average heart. A larger-than average heart was documented in certain high-performance Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, and Standardbred racehorses. It is also proposed as a theory that the great producing mare Pocahontas was homozygous for the X factor. Many outstanding race horses such as Eclipse and Secretariat were noted for being excellent broodmare producers but generally failed to produce male offspring with the ability of their sires, thus the theory that the gene was carried only on the x chromosome meant that stallions with large hearts could only pass on the trait via their daughters. Disorders of the circulatory system\n Anemia\n Arrhythmia\n Heart disease\n Heart failure\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Equine Anatomy and Physiology: Circulatory Systems\n\nHorse anatomy\n\nThe circulatory system of the horse consists of the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. Anatomy\n\nHeart\nThe equine heart is a muscular pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The average adult horse has a  heart, although it can be more than twice this size. The heart grows until the horse is 4 years of age, although it can increase slightly in size as a response to conditioning. Heart size does not necessarily correlate to the size of the horse. The equine cardiovascular system is hugely compliant with a heart rate range from 20 to 240 beats per minute and a splenic red cell reserve able to double packed cell volume and oxygen delivery during maximal exercise. However, studies on Thoroughbreds have shown that the proportion of skeletal muscle exceeds 50% of body weight, and so the energetic capacity of the muscular system far exceeds the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen. The heart and blood vessels contain approximately  of blood in a  horse, which equates to about 76 ml/kg (1.2 oz/lb). Frog\n\nThe horse hoof contains a structural component known as the \"frog\", which covers the deeper structure of the hoof known as the digital cushion, a vessel-filled tissue. When the horse places weight on a leg, the ground pushes upward on the frog, compressing it and the underlying digital cushion. Depending on cardiovascular fitness and the horse's response to exercise, this drops significantly within 15–30 seconds after the horse stops galloping. A two-year-old horse may have a slightly faster pulse, and a 2–4-week-old foal normally has a pulse between 70 and 90 bpm. Blood pressure\nAlthough blood pressure may vary greatly between animals, the average blood pressure for a standing horse is 120/70 mmHg. Gums\nThe gums of the horse can offer good clues to its circulatory health. The owner can assess the gums by lifting the upper lip with one hand, while holding the head still (via halter) with the other.

Forceps serve a number of purposes, including pinching or moving tissue for a better view during a procedure; blood vessel compression to stop bleeding; extracting human tissue or foreign objects in the body that include sponges, splinters and other materials; cutting bone; and applying or removing sterile gauze or bandages. There are also forceps designed to perform specific medical related tasks like wire twisting. The variety of forceps available today reflect the need for instruments able to assist surgeons, nurses and other healthcare professionals with precision during specific types of procedures. Surgical forceps include items like vascular tissue forceps, bone cutting forceps, biopsy forceps, gall bladder forceps, hysterectomy forceps and intestinal forceps, to name a few. There are forceps designed for major or micro surgery. High quality surgical forceps are stainless steel instruments that are made with different designs and in a variety of sizes. Some are locking forceps that can remain in place in order to free up the hands of the physician during a procedure. The forceps category includes forceps that open and close like tongs, tweezers and curettes for scraping tissue. Forceps also have different shapes and blade angles to enable medical personnel to better access different areas of the body. They include straight and curved forceps; forceps with a slight bend in the blade tips for grasping; steep-angled forceps blades for hard to reach areas; and heavy-duty forceps that look like pliers. Forceps blades are straight, curved or hooked; serrated or smooth; and different sizes. The single use tenaculum forceps are designed for IUD insertions and removals, and also for holding blood vessels. The single use Cheron forceps are used for holding swabs and cotton dressing in gynecology and other surgical procedures. The Cheron forceps are long and allow use in wound care as well as in IUD procedures. The length and the serrated jaws make the Cheron forceps a necessity in the medical treatment as an extremity of the healthcare professional arm. The Cheron single use forceps can be used for disinfecting and holding sponges during procedures. The ScopicLine™ is designed in a one dimensional line which allows an open clear view to see the procedures or to fit into the speculum using several instruments. The procedures are usually short and require 1-3 instruments. (These \n\n  Debakey forceps are a type of atraumatic tissue forceps used in vascular procedures to avoid tissue damage during manipulation. They are typically large (some examples are upwards of 12 inches (36 cm) long), and have a distinct coarsely ribbed grip panel, as opposed to the finer ribbing on most other tissue forceps. Outlet forceps, also known as low forceps or pelvic forceps, is a type of obstetric forceps used during childbirth. These forceps are specialized instruments designed to assist in the delivery of the baby when there are certain complications or difficulties during the pushing stage. In the outlet forceps technique, the baby's head is already visible at the vaginal opening and the forceps are applied to grasp it. The forceps are then gently applied to the sides of the baby's head and traction is applied during contractions to guide the baby's head through the birth canal. The forceps-assisted delivery should be carried out by a skilled healthcare provider, typically an obstetrician or a specially trained midwife, to minimize any potential risks and complications. The decision to use outlet forceps is based on several factors, including the mother's medical history, the condition of the baby, and the progress of labor. The healthcare provider will determine if the use of forceps is appropriate and will discuss the potential risks and benefits with the mother before proceeding. Overall, outlet forceps are a medical tool used to assist in the delivery of a baby when certain complications arise during labor.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The Concert for Bangladesh was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City to raise funds for Bangladeshi refugees. The first major benefit concert in history, it was organised by Harrison and Indian Bengali sitarist Ravi Shankar. The resulting Concert for Bangladesh, with appearances by Harrison, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and others was the first benefit concert of this magnitude in world history. The concert, record and film have raised millions of dollars for UNICEF. Harrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr. A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was released by Apple in December, followed by a concert film in 1972. The Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Like many spices, there is also the influence of a colonial legacy present within the rise of tandoori masala as Kundan Lal was a Hindu Punjabi-Pathan living in West Pakistan who ended up moving to Delhi, India in a time where communal violence rose after the Partition of India in 1947. While working in a restaurant in Peshawar in the 1920s, Kundan Lal experimented with the tandoor that was traditionally used for baking naan. In a stroke of genius, he was the first to cook chicken in the tandoor, and the spice blend he made and used for cooking the chicken in this manner became known as tandoori masala. In Delhi, Kundan Lal opened a restaurant called Moti Mahal, which is where dishes he created using tandoori masala reached national fame with politicians such as Jawaharlal Nehru favoring the taste and global fame as the restaurant became a global chain. The use of saffron in south Indian cuisine is perhaps best characterised by the eponymous Kesari bhath - a semolina based dessert from Karnataka. South Asian cuisines also use saffron in biryanis, which are spicy rice-vegetable dishes. The spice mixture may vary among regions, but usually it consists of a combination of ground shallot, garlic, Indian bay leaves, turmeric, lemongrass, tamarind juice, candlenut, galangal, salt and sugar.

It includes the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of microbial diseases. Medical Microbiologist innovates new diagnostic kits, discovers new drugs with antibiotic sensitivity tests and isolates unique species from extreme environments. Medical microbiologists diagnose diseases such as tuberculosis, meningitis, salmonella, thrush (Candida) and MRSA infection, to name a few. A medical microbiologist is a specialist in medical clinical microbiology. Medical Microbiologists establishes and directs infection control programs across public health care, infectious disease prevention and epidemiology. Medical microbiologists also play a key role in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The tasks of medical microbiology include studying microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, with a focus on their impact on human health and disease. Medical microbiologists play a crucial role in the practice of physicians by helping diagnose and treat infectious diseases. By studying the classification, morphology, and ultrastructure of microorganisms, medical microbiologists can identify specific pathogens and understand their characteristics and mechanisms of action. Medical microbiologists also study the nutritional requirements and metabolic processes of microorganisms. This knowledge helps in the development of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents that specifically target these organisms, aiding in the treatment and prevention of infections. Additionally, medical microbiologists investigate the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, helping physicians make informed decisions on the appropriate use of antibiotics and implement strategies to prevent the spread of resistant strains. Medical microbiologists study the immune response to infections and analyze the interactions between microorganisms and the immune system. This knowledge helps physicians understand how infections impact the immune system and develop strategies to enhance immune responses through vaccination or immunotherapy. In summary, medical microbiology contributes to the practice of physicians by providing essential knowledge and understanding of microorganisms, their characteristics, and their impact on human health. This understanding helps physicians in diagnosing, treating, and preventing infectious diseases more effectively. ; Perform various specializations (Hematology, Microbiology, Clinical Chemistry, Genetics,  Cytogenetics, Immunology, etc. This section contains a list of publications on microbiology. Contemporary microbiologists study chemosynthetic bacteria and their role in ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Today, the elective method is still an essential technique used by microbiologists to study specific microorganisms and their functions. Contemporary microbiologists continue to use the direct method to investigate microbial communities in diverse ecosystems, providing insights into their functions, interactions, and ecological significance. Furthermore, Winogradsky's work highlighted the importance of microbial ecology problems. The study of microbial ecology remains crucial today, as microbiologists seek to understand the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environments. This knowledge contributes to various fields, such as environmental microbiology, biogeochemistry, and microbial biotechnology. In summary, Sergei N. Winogradsky's contributions to microbiology, including the discovery of chemosynthesis, the development of the elective method, the application of the direct method, and his focus on microbial ecology, have had a lasting impact on contemporary microbiologists.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The debates were mainly about slavery. Douglas defended his Kansas–Nebraska Act, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of Missouri with popular sovereignty, which allowed residents of territories such as the Kansas to vote either for or against slavery. Douglas put Lincoln on the defensive by accusing him of being a Black Republican abolitionist, but Lincoln responded by asking Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. Illinois Republicans had nominated him to face Douglas because of his skill at making speeches and his ability to frame the issue of slavery in a manner that conveyed visceral opposition to the institution without antagonizing racist American voters.

But here's the rub: Doctors are ill-informed, too. And patients can even be turned away despite telltale symptoms, like happened to Le Keisha Ruffin just weeks after the birth of her daughter, Caitlyn. \"I like to call that my miracle bath,\" Ruffin said, because the sudden swelling proved the tip-off for doctors. The long, sharply pointed beak is pinkish-yellow and the legs are brown. The birds breed colonially in spring in \"heronries\", usually building their nests high in trees. A clutch of usually three to five bluish-green eggs is laid. In Ancient Egypt, the deity Bennu was depicted as a heron in New Kingdom artwork. Then I continued the treatment. He associated the symptoms with a possible illness. For I had never heard of side effects like these caused by a ‘simple’ antibiotic. I tried to treat it, but it was not solved with conventional medicines. Already exhausted from going to doctors and distressed by the situation, I decided to treat myself against the bacteria and bought Florax and Metronidazole. After some time I could not sleep, I had a psychotic outbreak, but I was conscientious enough to realize that my situation was on the edge and that it tended to get worse. That’s why I tried suicide. But I was rescued on time and interned. I was right. The people around me took a long time to understand what was happening to me, I myself only went deep into the subject after many months. I hoped that all the effects they would pass and tried to lead a normal life. It came to a point where I realized all my physical limitations and decided to retreat. I thought about giving up and tried suicide again. Because of that, I was placed in a psychiatric clinic. Of course it did not help. Except for the friendships I made and the resocialization that I had even in an environment not so conducive to it. I thought I had lost my youth and was afraid of getting old with all those symptoms. The situation is dramatic, I was a healthy young man but I became weak and could not do anything I liked and planned to do. My family even forbade me to go online after all the doctors were saying I was hypochondriac. Despite my distrust and disapproval of my family, I decided to do the treatment. I took several natural remedies such as magnesium, omega 3, high doses Vitamin D3, Probiotic Pool, Charcoal, Beer yeast, MSM, coconut oil, safflower oil, melatonin, alpha-lipoic acid, low doses of LDN, BIO21, suncushion, high doses of vitamin A, betaine hydrochloride, slug, etc. Anyway, it’s complicated to write a story that is still going on. For example, I just did ozonotherapy and the improvement I got was impressive. And I hope this time I just get better. I remember when I was desperately searching for a solution to the terrible effects I was having and how stunned I was when I could not find a quick and definitive solution to the problem. I believe that my story can help people who find themselves in this way at this time because it was not just a matter of positive thinking or psychological overcoming, it was clear and objective proof that there is a solution to the problem, but this solution is not as the pharmaceutical industry has accustomed us, there is no remedy for the disease, what exists is the organism that is so weakened that it becomes vulnerable to it. What was to be the beginning of a career of stability became a legal battle after Marcal was dismissed without justification in an internal process in the least confused. “Despite being a particular case, it portrays a series of vices and misconceptions that may occur in other public companies in general”; argues Marçal. According to him, the reason for the low performance were the health problems that even later removed him for medical treatment. “They said only that if I took the certificates, I would be guaranteed. Why? Difficulty believing is normal .. I became skeptical and gave up several times, because in conventional medicine managed by the Rockefellers, it is much easier to destroy your health than to recover it. I believe my story shows how strenuous the struggle is to strengthen and recover an organism deluged by the Pharmaceutical Industry, but it is possible. Good job, Marcal. Thank God for the Internet otherwise we’d all be still searching for answers. Glad you’re going do well. Your story can help instill hope and encouragement in others. Keep it up, and best of luck to you! That is such an awesome recovery you made!!!! I’m sure many floxies on here would love to hear more details to possibly help us heal more!!! How much and how often? I consider all the natural treatments I have done and supplements that I have made important. It is wonderful that you finally got better from such a nightmare, Marçal. Parabens! True, the cases are increasing more and more here in Brazil. But, of course, the mainstream media does not divulge. And I’m still called crazy or conspiracy when I complain.

He was a goldsmith and silversmith, and engaged in the diamond and jewellery business in New York City. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (Le Bon Marché) and in New York (Stewart's). Today, departments often include the following: clothing, cosmetics, do it yourself, furniture, gardening, hardware, home appliances, houseware, paint, sporting goods, toiletries, and toys. Since the 1980s, they have come under heavy pressure from discounters, and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010. The Outlet Company was formed in 1891 when brothers Joseph and Leon Samuels opened a department store at 176 Weybosset Street in downtown Providence. Known as The Outlet, it quickly became a Providence landmark to the point of occupying an entire city block and attracting shoppers from all over southern New England. For decades, the store remained strong with its sole flagship location and dominated the field of retail in not only Providence, but Rhode Island as a whole. With the changing field of retail in the mid-20th Century, the company diversified with opening suburban locations as well as buying some existing stores such as Philadelphia-based Phillipsborn and Bedya, the midwestern Hughes & Hatcher chain, and The Edw. Malley Co. department store chain in New Haven, Connecticut. However, the allure of building a broadcasting empire under the leadership of company president Bruce Sundlun led Outlet to leave the retail business in November 1980. In 1981, the Outlet Company sold the original downtown retail store (and other stores) to United Department Stores and the flagship Outlet location on Weybosset Street was shuttered in 1982. John G. Myers Company was a department store in Albany, New York built in 1887 and owned by John Gillespy Myers. After the collapse the store reopened at 37 N.

It is noted for its floating markets, rice paper-making village, and picturesque rural canals. It has a population of around 1,282,300 as of 2018, and is located on the south bank of the Hậu River, a distributary of the Mekong River. In 2007, about 50 people died when the Cần Thơ Bridge collapsed, causing Vietnam's worst engineering disaster. In 2011, Cần Thơ International Airport opened. The city is nicknamed the \"western capital\" (Vietnamese is Tây Đô), and is located 169 km from Hồ Chí Minh City. The conquest of the south of present-day Vietnam was a long process of territorial acquisition by the Vietnamese. It is called Nam tiến (Chinese characters: 南進, English meaning \"South[ern] Advance\") by Vietnamese historians. Vietnam (then known as Đại Việt) greatly expanded its territory in 1470 under the great king Lê Thánh Tông, at the expense of Champa. In 1516, Portuguese traders sailing from Malacca landed in Da Nang, Đại Việt, and established a presence there. They named the area \"Cochin-China\", borrowing the first part from the Malay Kuchi, which referred to all of Vietnam, and which in turn derived from the Chinese Jiāozhǐ, pronounced \n\nThe government of Vietnam has initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country with preventive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 in the country. Vietnam has prepared for the epidemic as early as the very first case in China emerged, around mid-December 2019, and pursued a zero-COVID strategy until September 2021. Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the spread of the disease into Vietnam, as well as to warn Vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks. Advance preparations\nAccording to Kidong Park, World Health Organization representative to Vietnam, the first risk assessment exercise was conducted by the Vietnamese in early January – soon after cases in China started being reported. On 3 January 2020, the day before the WHO said there was a cluster of cases in Wuhan, Vietnam tightened control at the Vietnam-China border. On 23 January, Vietnam confirmed its first case. Shortly afterward, the Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ramped up Vietnam's response by issuing an urgent document to ministries, provinces, and broadcasting agencies addressing the dangerousness of the virus and the need for measures to prevent local transmission. On 24 January, just one day after the first cases, the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam ordered the cancellation of all flights from and to Wuhan. As Vietnam celebrated the Tết holiday, the Prime Minister declared war on the coronavirus. \"Fighting this epidemic is like fighting the enemy\", he said at an urgent Communist Party meeting on 27 January. On the same day, Vietnam implemented stricter measures, suspending inbound and outbound flights related to the epicenters in China, restricting tourists, dosing train connection, and suggested people suspend trade and other exchange activities between the two countries. Vietnam has 63 provincial health departments, an approximately 600 district health centers and more than 11,000 primary health stations. Aggressive measures were also taken to combat possible outbreaks, from 14 days quarantine to restriction of outdoor activities (some sources believe it was more than 20 to 40 days under quarantine), the Vietnam People's Armed Forces also takes part on patrolling and controlling measures. Sixty-eight military camps with a capacity of 40,000 people were set up to receive people ordered into quarantine. The first case of mass quarantine in Vietnam took place on February 12 in Sơn Lôi, Vĩnh Phúc, an community of 10,000 people for 20 days over seven coronavirus cases – the first large-scale lockdown known outside China. On the night of 6 March, when the 17th case was reported in Hanoi, the city held an urgent meeting, then coordinated with related ministries — including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Security, and Ministry of Transportation — to prevent the virus from spreading to the community. On March 7, Hanoi locked down Trúc Bạch Street, where the patient resided along with 66 households and 189 people. When the Bạch Mai Hospital in Hanoi became a coronavirus hotspot with dozens of cases in late March, the authorities imposed a lockdown on the facility and tracked down nearly 100,000 people related to the hospital, including medics, patients, visitors and their close contacts. On 23 April 2020, Vietnamese government lifted social isolation rules, subsequently allowing re-opening of non-essential services including restaurants. Everyone who enters Vietnam from abroad, however, continued to be quarantined upon arrival for 14 days. Among the flights conducted was notably the first-ever direct flight in history operated by Vietnam Airlines from Vietnam to the United States on 7 May. On 11 May, Vietnamese government started a nationwide tourism campaign, named 'Vietnamese travel Vietnam', to increase domestic demand for travelling and promote domestic tourism. Da Nang lockdown \n\nIn late-July 2020, Vietnam was placed on high alert after the government confirmed dozens of community infections, the first since April, all in or around Da Nang. On 27 July, the government made the decision to evacuate 80,000 people from Da Nang. The government said the process would take four days with domestic airlines operating approximately 100 flights daily from Da Nang to 11 cities around the country. On the same day, the Da Nang Municipal People's Committee announced restrictions applicable for 15 days, starting from 28 July. Six districts in quarantine area include: Hai Chau, Thanh Khe, Son Tra, Ngu Hanh Son, Cam Le, and Lien Chieu District with more than one million people requested to stay at home and only go out in case of extreme necessity such as buying food, medicine,seeking essential goods and services, and medical emergencies. The Da Nang Department of Health was asked to promptly organize epidemiological investigation, contact-tracing in areas related to the confirmed cases, and massive testing to early detect infection sources and high-risk cases. The rural district of Hoa Vang was the last district to be quarantined, starts from 13:00, 28 July 2020. On 31 July, the neighboring city of Hội An were also placed under quarantine for 15 days after at least 4 people tested positive with COVID-19. According to the regulation of the Ministry of Transport issued on 27 July to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nOn 12 August, Da Nang has decided to continue social distancing for another two weeks when the number of cases in the community still shows no signs of stopping. July 2021-now \n\nFrom 9 February to 1 March 2021, facing an increase in cases, Ho Chi Minh City closed down spas, wedding halls, cinemas, clubs and other entertainment venues. On 31 May, strict social distancing measures were again imposed in all of Ho Chi Minh City, closing down all non-essential services. In Ho Chi Minh City and Bình Dương Province, officials instructed factories to follow the \"three on site\" model, which required workers to eat, sleep, and work on the factory grounds. Factory owners hurried to supply tents and bathrooms for their employees, who were crowded into warehouses and parking lots. Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong Province, known as the country's \"locomotive,\" are home to two of Vietnam's major industrial parks. The government of Ho Chi Minh City said on 22 October that workers willing to return would receive free transportation and lodging for the first month. Pouyuen Vietnam's workforce has returned to Ho Chi Minh City in large numbers, according to the company. For example in Ho Chi Minh City, COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a growing demand for a large amount of personal health declaration, but testing registration process in here still rely on verbal communication between local authorities and citizens without any online services. Administrative procedures in Vietnam are sometimes only symbolically available online and people still have to go to the government buildings to complete the important parts. In Vietnamese society, there is a lack of digital readiness among the generations. Public communication and propaganda\nThe Vietnamese government using social media platforms to keep the public informed of COVID-19 news and instructions. Thong Tin Chinh Phu (Governmental Information), the government's official Facebook page, provides nearly hourly updates on the country's pandemic situation. Vietnam is also relying on its propaganda apparatus to help tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. On the streets, public art in the style of Cold War-era propaganda posters has flourished, exalting nurses instead of guerrillas. Pictures and posts about overloaded hospitals, patients lying on the floor with ventilators or oxygen tanks, people calling for help because a relative has died are widely spread by people on social networks in Vietnam. Like many governments, Vietnam is also wary of becoming over reliant on any single country for its vaccines. The Vietnamese government has issued several incentives in the form of tax breaks, delayed tax payments, and land-use fees for businesses. According to the United Nations, Vietnamese government has issued and is implementing a multi-sectoral response to address the social and economic impact of the crisis. However, MOLISA reports indicated some key challenges in implementing this package, including complicated procedures leading to late delivery of cash and limited local funds (30-50% of total local funds) among poor provinces, such as Bình Định, Hòa Bình, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. In the capital city Hanoi, to receive the financial aid of $65 USD, the government requested people to print the approval documents when the print shops are closed, and go to get confirmation documents back in their hometown while Hanoi is under lockdown and every vehicle cannot get out of the city. Evacuation and repatriation \n\nAs of January 2022, more than 200,000 Vietnamese people have been flown back to the country on 800 repatriation flights from 60 countries and territories around the world. These flights are reported to cost several times more expensive than conventional commercial flights since embassy officials frequently collect illegitimate fees for their own personal gain. There are also discrepancies among individuals chosen to return, with those who have the relationships with embassy personnel often being picked over those who do not. On 28 July, Vietnam Airlines repatriation flight VN05 departed from Hanoi to Equatorial Guinea to bring 219 Vietnamese workers back to Vietnam. According to the airline statement, the Airbus A350 will fly directly from Noi Bai International Airport to the city of Bata for more than 12 hours, then stop picking up passengers and refueling for 3 hours, then return to Vietnam. On the plane, there are 2 doctors and 2 nurses of the Hanoi National Hospital of Tropical Diseases to promptly provide emergency and support to the patients. Reception\n\n2020\n\nIn comparison to other commended examples like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, Vietnam had experienced a much lower number of cases, and no fatalities for six consecutive months — an achievement recalling the success in 2003 when Vietnam became the first country to be cleared of the SARS outbreak. Even after dozens of deaths recorded during the second wave, the toll in Vietnam against its population, peaking at the rate of 0.4 deaths per million people, remains lower than most of the world. Researcher Martha Lincoln, the San Francisco State medical anthropologist, who has worked in Vietnam extensively, describes Vietnam's public health response as \"impeccable and relentless\". Vietnam responded to the pandemic \"early and proactively\", as complimented by World Health Organization representative Kidong Park, with risk assessment conducted just after first reported cases in China in January. The Guardian praised Vietnam's propaganda posters reflecting the wartime spirit and Vietnamese nationalism, along with early isolation and tracing objects in contact with the sick helped Vietnam avoid the disaster that Europe is suffering. Another the reasons Vietnam was able to act so quickly and keep the case count so low is that the country experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and human cases of avian influenza between 2004 and 2010. As a result, Vietnam had both the experience and infrastructure to take appropriate action. Vietnam makes many key containment decisions in a matter of days, which may take weeks for governments in other countries to make. Although Vietnam is a highly centralized country, a number of key decisions were made at the local level, which also contributed to the swift response. These sentiments imply an attitude of self-sacrifice on behalf of the broader community, a value that may be explained in part through Vietnam's socialist history and decades-long struggle for sovereignty. Analysts indicate transparency as the key difference between pandemic management in Vietnam and in the neighboring China, despite their similar communist institutions. Most international experts present in Vietnam refute skepticism and accord high credibility to statistics provided by the Ministry of Health. According to Professor Guy Thwaites, the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City had conducted 20,000 separate tests, of which the results matched those publicized by the government. An investigation by Reuters correspondents in April on 13 funeral organizers in Hanoi found no abnormal upsurge in the number of deaths, if not even a slight decrease due to reduction of traffic accidents during the lockdown. Huong Le Thu, analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, cites reports of deaths during the second wave as a further demonstration that the zero fatality rate in the previous phase \"should have not been questioned in the first place\". Trien Vinh Le and Huy Quynh Nguyen from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City highlight the difference from the censorship policy in China:\n\n2021\nThe fourth wave of infections came amidst the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant, coupled with low vaccination rates, and waning public opinion of Vietnam's performance in pandemic prevention. Pham Minh Duc, a senior research officer at the Burnet Institute said: \"The current outbreak has crippled [Vietnam's] preventive healthcare system and placed the country's health care under extreme stress.\" The ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, reached 4.5%, exceeding Indonesia's 3.7% and Thailand's 1%, placing further stress on the healthcare system, which was already overburdened and thus unable to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients. Another reason is Vietnam’s slow vaccine rollout. The weaker response to the pandemic than the previous government because of an overemphasis on growth has had a negative impact on Vietnam's worldwide reputation, as well as on local trust in the administration, signaling a rocky start for Phạm Minh Chính's new government. In some areas of Ho Chi Minh City, 11 health staff are in charge of the health of 140,000 people. The proportion of medical staff in Ho Chi Minh City is the lowest in Vietnam, only about 2.31 per 10,000 people, lower than the national average of 7. Director of the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Health Tang Chi Thuong said: \"Medical staff are exhausted, it has been almost eight months that they have not had a day off while the income is too low, this is the reason why many medical workers quit their job\". This is an inadequacy that has existed for many years in Vietnam. According to the director of Ho Chi Minh City's health department, in the long run, the government should have a mechanism to adjust and allocate health stations according to population, which means there is one health station for every 10,000 people. During the outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City in May 2021, the Vietnamese authorities blamed Ms. Loan, the Protestant pastor who traveled to Hanoi in late April for causing the outbreak. There is an opinion that the communist government uses Christian people as scapegoats to justify the outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City. Christians, usually to be seen in the eyes of the communist rulers as a threat due to their previous support for the French and Americans. For example, in Bắc Giang Province, a woman tested positive for COVID-19, and the authorities decided to take her to the hospital for treatment while leaving her 3-day-old child alone in an isolation camp. Vietnam has prepared for the epidemic as early as the very first case in China emerged, around mid-December 2019, and pursued a zero-COVID strategy until September 2021. Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the spread of the disease into Vietnam, as well as to warn Vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks. Advance preparations\nAccording to Kidong Park, World Health Organization representative to Vietnam, the first risk assessment exercise was conducted by the Vietnamese in early January – soon after cases in China started being reported. On 3 January 2020, the day before the WHO said there was a cluster of cases in Wuhan, Vietnam tightened control at the Vietnam-China border. On 23 January, Vietnam confirmed its first case. Shortly afterward, the Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ramped up Vietnam's response by issuing an urgent document to ministries, provinces, and broadcasting agencies addressing the dangerousness of the virus and the need for measures to prevent local transmission. On 24 January, just one day after the first cases, the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam ordered the cancellation of all flights from and to Wuhan. As Vietnam celebrated the Tết holiday, the Prime Minister declared war on the coronavirus. \"Fighting this epidemic is like fighting the enemy\", he said at an urgent Communist Party meeting on 27 January. On the same day, Vietnam implemented stricter measures, suspending inbound and outbound flights related to the epicenters in China, restricting tourists, dosing train connection, and suggested people suspend trade and other exchange activities between the two countries. Vietnam has 63 provincial health departments, an approximately 600 district health centers and more than 11,000 primary health stations. Aggressive measures were also taken to combat possible outbreaks, from 14 days quarantine to restriction of outdoor activities (some sources believe it was more than 20 to 40 days under quarantine), the Vietnam People's Armed Forces also takes part on patrolling and controlling measures.

James retained a keen interest in Scottish affairs, running the government by the rapid interchange of letters, aided by the establishment of an efficient postal system. He controlled everyday policy through the Privy Council of Scotland and managed the Parliament of Scotland through the Lords of the Articles. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and \n\n The Acts of Union between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a Kingdom of Great Britain governed by a unified Parliament of Great Britain according to the Treaty of Union. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate independent states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch, starting with James I of England (also James VI of Scotland)) into a single kingdom. The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, \n\n the parliament grew as he called them more frequently and its composition shifted to include more representation from the burghs and lesser landowners.

Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Famously, he strung along the opposition and was expected to make \n\n In 1978, while still leader of the opposition, Thatcher told ITV's World In Action that \"People [in Britain] are rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture\", which was seen as politicising the issue of race in UK politics. This perspective differed from her approach to welfare programs for poor families or work supports for women. Thatcher's view on nursery education influenced her approach to government spending on welfare programs in that she saw nursery education as a separate entity from these programs. While she advocated for cutting welfare spending in general, she made an exception for nursery education, considering it as an investment in the future of children rather than a form of welfare provision. It is important to note that although Thatcher's efforts to promote nursery education and early childhood care are not commonly associated with her legacy, her perspective on these issues challenged understandings about the formation and consistency of both Britain's childcare policy and 'Thatcherism'.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The character was originally conceived by creative director George Pal of the Wade Ad Agency and designed by illustrator Wally Wood. Speedy appeared in over 200 TV commercials between 1954 and 1964. Buster Keaton appeared along with the animated Speedy Alka-Seltzer figure in a series of 1950s commercials based on the product's then-current slogan, \"Relief is just a swallow away.\" Alka-Seltzer TV ads from the 1960s and 1970s in the US were among the most popular of the 20th century, ranking number 13, according to Advertising Age. Paul Margulies (father of actress Julianna Margulies) created the famous \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz\" ad campaign when he worked as a Madison Avenue ad executive. The ubiquitous jingle was composed by Tom Dawes—a former member of The Cyrkle. George Raft starred in the 1969 Alka-Seltzer commercial \"The Unfinished Lunch\". (The commercial was so popular that several weeks later, Raft appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Raft told Carson that it took more than 7 hours to tape the 30-second commercial. Raft was enraged by the end of the day, thus making his inmate portrayal that much more convincing for the final editing. The film crew gave Raft his crumpled tin cup, which he showed to Carson and the audience. An animated mid-1960s commercial, animated by R. O. Blechman, shows a man and his own stomach sitting opposite each other in chairs, having an argument moderated by their therapist in a voiceover. The stomach (voiced by Gene Wilder) accuses the man of purposely trying to irritate it. Alka-Seltzer had a series of commercials during the mid-1960s that used a song called \"No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)\". The ads were unique in that they featured only the midsections (no faces) of people of all shapes and sizes. A version of this ad can be seen briefly in the 1988 motion picture The In Crowd, immediately before the movie's first live broadcast of the fictitious \"Perry Parker's Dance Party.\" In an Alka-Seltzer commercial from 1969, an actor (played by Jack Somack) in a commercial for the fictional product \"Magdalini's Meatballs\" has to eat a meatball and then say \"Mamma mia, that's-a spicy meat-a ball-a!\" Take after take is ruined by some comedic trial or another (comedian Ronny Graham dropping the clapperboard). By the commercial's end, Jack has eaten so many meatballs that it's \"Alka-Seltzer to the rescue.\" With his stomach settled, Jack does a perfect take, except that the oven door falls off. The director (off-camera) sighs and says, \"OK, let's break for lunch.\" A 1970 commercial shows a newlywed couple in the bedroom after the woman (played by Alice Playten) has finished serving her husband (played by Terry Kiser) a giant dumpling; the implication is that her cooking skills are severely lacking, despite her husband's lament, \"I can't believe I ate that whole thing! \", the commercial's catchphrase. She offers her beleaguered husband a heart-shaped meatloaf; he disappears to take some Alka-Seltzer. He returns to the bathroom for more Alka-Seltzer. The catchphrase, Howie Cohen told the Los Angeles Times, was inspired when he ate too much of the food at a London commercial shoot because \"I am a nice Jewish kid from the Bronx, so I ate everything,\" and when he told his wife \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing\", she said, \"There's your next Alka-Seltzer commercial.\" A 1971 commercial featured another catch-phrase from Cohen (along with Bob Pasqualina), \"Try it, you'll like it!\" In 1972, an actor (Milt Moss) spent the commercial moaning, \"I can't believe I ate that who-o-o-o-o-ole thing,\" while his wife (Lynn Whinic) made sarcastic comments and finally advised him to take some Alka-Seltzer. In 2005, this ad was also remade, featuring Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts from the 1996–2005 TV sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. Both the big band and rock versions had additional lyrics (with at least one verse unique to each song) written by Tom Dawes, former lead singer of The Cyrkle who wrote the original jingle. Miniature figures of the Speedy mascot were shown with each. In December 2010, Alka-Seltzer began a series of new commercials featuring Speedy, using a CG character, created by Animation Director David Hulin, to recreate the stop-motion puppetry of the 1950s and 1960s, with Speedy voiced by Debi Derryberry.

The ubiquitous jingle was composed by Tom Dawes—a former member of The Cyrkle. George Raft starred in the 1969 Alka-Seltzer commercial \"The Unfinished Lunch\". (The commercial was so popular that several weeks later, Raft appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Raft told Carson that it took more than 7 hours to tape the 30-second commercial. Raft was enraged by the end of the day, thus making his inmate portrayal that much more convincing for the final editing. The film crew gave Raft his crumpled tin cup, which he showed to Carson and the audience. An animated mid-1960s commercial, animated by R. O. Blechman, shows a man and his own stomach sitting opposite each other in chairs, having an argument moderated by their therapist in a voiceover. The stomach (voiced by Gene Wilder) accuses the man of purposely trying to irritate it. Alka-Seltzer had a series of commercials during the mid-1960s that used a song called \"No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)\". The ads were unique in that they featured only the midsections (no faces) of people of all shapes and sizes.

By the commercial's end, Jack has eaten so many meatballs that it's \"Alka-Seltzer to the rescue.\" With his stomach settled, Jack does a perfect take, except that the oven door falls off. The director (off-camera) sighs and says, \"OK, let's break for lunch.\" A 1970 commercial shows a newlywed couple in the bedroom after the woman (played by Alice Playten) has finished serving her husband (played by Terry Kiser) a giant dumpling; the implication is that her cooking skills are severely lacking, despite her husband's lament, \"I can't believe I ate that whole thing! \", the commercial's catchphrase. She offers her beleaguered husband a heart-shaped meatloaf; he disappears to take some Alka-Seltzer. He returns to the bathroom for more Alka-Seltzer. The catchphrase, Howie Cohen told the Los Angeles Times, was inspired when he ate too much of the food at a London commercial shoot because \"I am a nice Jewish kid from the Bronx, so I ate everything,\" and when he told his wife \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing\", she said, \"There's your next Alka-Seltzer commercial.\" A 1971 commercial featured another catch-phrase from Cohen (along with Bob Pasqualina), \"Try it, you'll like it!\" In 1972, an actor (Milt Moss) spent the commercial moaning, \"I can't believe I ate that who-o-o-o-o-ole thing,\" while his wife (Lynn Whinic) made sarcastic comments and finally advised him to take some Alka-Seltzer. In 2005, this ad was also remade, featuring Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts from the 1996–2005 TV sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. Both the big band and rock versions had additional lyrics (with at least one verse unique to each song) written by Tom Dawes, former lead singer of The Cyrkle who wrote the original jingle. Miniature figures of the Speedy mascot were shown with each. In December 2010, Alka-Seltzer began a series of new commercials featuring Speedy, using a CG character, created by Animation Director David Hulin, to recreate the stop-motion puppetry of the 1950s and 1960s, with Speedy voiced by Debi Derryberry. Marketing\n\nThe product has been extensively advertised since its launch in the United States.

Additionally, when used in back-end transcription, it has the potential to increase productivity for transcriptionists. However, there are also some limitations and weaknesses associated with speech recognition technology. Compared to human transcription, speech recognition is not as accurate. Major errors can occur up to three times more frequently with speech recognition. Moreover, in front-end use, medical doctors may need to spend more time on dictation and correction when using speech recognition compared to human transcription. The success of implementation depends on factors such as system reliability, accuracy, user-friendly interfaces, and effective training programs. Technical issues, such as poor recognition accuracy, can be a barrier to its implementation. Additionally, resistance from healthcare professionals who are accustomed to traditional dictation methods may hinder adoption. Effective training programs and support for users can also facilitate the successful implementation of speech recognition technology. Phones are the generator of choice to be inferred and it encodes the word in a noisy, highly variable way. In real situations, the signal is further complicated by background noises such as cars driving by or artifacts such as a cough in mid sentence (Mumford's 2nd underpinning). Hidden Markov Models were first applied to speech recognition by James K. Baker in 1975. Continuous speech recognition occurs by the following steps, modeled by a HMM. Feature analysis is first undertaken on temporal and/or spectral features of the speech signal. The feature is then compared to all sequences of the speech recognition units. Similar to the lexicon decoding, the system path is further constrained by the rules of grammar and syntax. In the last decade, there have been significant advancements in speech technology, largely due to new machine learning paradigms. Some key areas of progress in speech technology include:\n\n1. Speech production and auditory perception: New machine learning paradigms have enabled better understanding and modeling of the human speech production system and how it is perceived by the auditory system. This has improved the accuracy and naturalness of speech synthesis systems. This has led to advancements in speech recognition systems and language processing algorithms. Speech recognition: Machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and neural networks, have significantly improved speech recognition accuracy. These systems utilize natural language processing techniques and dialogue management algorithms to provide a more user-friendly and personalized experience. These developments have enhanced the accuracy, naturalness, and usability of speech technologies, leading to their widespread adoption in various applications. Despite its potential benefits, speech recognition technology also faces challenges. One main challenge is the high error rates that have been associated with early implementations. Improving the accuracy and reducing errors remain significant hurdles. However, advancements in hardware such as improved processors and increased memory capacities are addressing these limitations. Privacy and security concerns also pose challenges when implementing speech recognition technology. However, addressing challenges such as errors, training the system for diverse speech patterns, and maintaining privacy and security are vital for successful implementation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

In this film, Chen Zhen rescues a Manchu princess, starting an adventure in which he helps the princess and a Chinese resistance fighter (portrayed by Yuen Biao) defend China from Japanese invaders. First portrayed by Bruce Lee in the 1972 film Fist of Fury, the character has been the subject of numerous film and television series, including remakes and adaptations of Fist of Fury. Although Chen Zhen's story varies in the different remakes and adaptations, most have an ending similar to the original Fist of Fury. Wuxia films experienced a revival in recent years with the films of Ang Lee and Zhang Yimou. His 2001 film Shaolin Soccer combined kung fu, modified using CGI, with the sports and comedy genres.

Due to its location on the Delaware River, the ballpark offered a clear view of the Philadelphia skyline. The \"Riversharks\" name referred to the location of Camden on the Delaware River, and the primary logo incorporated the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that links Camden to Philadelphia. On October 21, 2015, the Camden Riversharks announced they would cease operations immediately due to the inability to reach an agreement on lease terms with the owner of Campbell's Field, the Camden County Improvement Authority (the authority had purchased Campbell's Field from Rutgers University two months prior). A crowd of 600 was on hand to see Dover defeat Wilmington in the league opener. Camden began play under manager J.R. Richardson. The league records and standings on the folding date of July 25, 1889 were: Dover (8–2), Milford (6–5), Wilmington (5–4) Camden (3–6) and Smyrna (1–6). Camden was 4.5 games behind Dover in the standings.

Following a lineup change in early 1972, they toured the world from 1972 to 1973.

After Santana found themselves without a label in the mid-1990s, founding member and guitarist Carlos Santana began talks with Arista president Clive Davis. Santana and Davis collaborated with A&R man Pete Ganbarg, as Santana wanted to focus on pop and radio-friendly material; Santana collaborated with contemporary guest artists including Eric Clapton, Rob Thomas, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Maná, KC Porter and CeeLo Green. He is the son of ten-time Grammy winning guitarist Carlos Santana and poet/author/activist Deborah Santana. His maternal grandfather, Saunders King, is an icon of American blues and his paternal grandfather, Jose Santana, is a violinist and mariachi bandleader. In 1999, Santana collaborated with his father on composing the Grammy winning track \"El Farol\" on the album Supernatural. While Santana himself and most of the other musicians were in their early 20s, some were older; for instance Lewis was 32, Hadley Caliman 40, and Peraza 47. During this period, Santana's relationship with longtime keyboardist/vocalist Gregg Rolie rapidly deteriorated (keyboardist Tom Coster performed on one song before replacing Rolie shortly after the album's release). It was also the last Santana album to feature guitarist Neal Schon, who went on to co-found Journey the following year. Caravanserai marked a major turning point in Carlos Santana's career as it was a departure from his critically acclaimed first three albums. The album is the first in a series of Santana albums that were known for their increasing musical complexity, marking a move away from the popular rock format of the early Santana albums toward a more contemplative and experimental jazz sound.

Charles David Kelman (May 23, 1930June 1, 2004) was an American ophthalmologist, surgeon, inventor, jazz musician, entertainer, and Broadway producer. Known as the father of phacoemulsification, he developed many of the medical devices, instruments, implant lenses and techniques used in cataract surgery. Kelman was given the National Medal of Technology by President George H. W. Bush and recognized as the Ophthalmologist of the Century by the International Congress of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in Montreal, Canada. He was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, and received the 2004 Lasker Award. Born in New York, Kelman graduated from Tufts University and earned his medical degree from University of Geneva before returning to New York to intern at Kings County Hospital and complete his residency at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. He was later an attending surgeon at the Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and maintained a private practice. Kelman pursued a career as an entertainer alongside his medical career. While in medical school in Geneva, he appeared on two jazz radio shows and one on television. After inventing phacoemulsification, in part to promote the procedure, he began appearing regularly on television, first on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1975. Early life and education \nCharles David Kelman was born on May 23, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York, to Eva and David Kelman. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Greece who never received the proper compensation and recognition for his inventions, including the first tar-free cigarettes and cellophane Christmas wreaths. He inspired his son's desire to proudly seek recognition of his own inventions. When Charles admitted he had not, his father announced: \"You'll be a doctor.\" Kelman attended Boston's Tufts University and graduated in just two years to earn a B.S. He then studied medicine at the University of Geneva and, after learning that his father was diagnosed with cancer, accelerated his studies with the hope of having his father see him becoming a doctor. He obtained his M.D. degree in 1956, but not before his father's death the year before. Career\n\nAs an ophthalmologist and surgeon \nIn 1960, Kelman started an ophthalmology private practice and began to experiment with the use of cryosurgery. His first invention in 1962 was the cryoprobe which he used to freeze a cataractous lens before removal in intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), which removed the lens with the capsule intact. He began testing the procedure on animals in April 1966. In 1967, Kelman secretly conducted his first surgery on a blind patient, awaiting enucleation, who volunteered knowing that the procedure would not bring back his vision. His first patient's eye became infected and was removed. However, he was successful on subsequent attempts. Kelman's developments allowed the incision necessary for ECCE to be reduced from  to  and minimized recovery time. Kelman's critics said the procedure was \"ridiculous\" or \"malpractice\". That same year, the Kelman Satellite Teleconference was presented at the annual AAO conference, allowing the more than 400 in attendance to observe a live broadcast of Kelman performing five procedures. Hedy Lamarr, who Kelman treated in October 1980, said \"I was blind for more than seven years. At various times in his career, Kelman served as clinical professor of ophthalmology at New York Medical College and as an attending surgeon at the Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Later in his career, he invented a way to create collagen from a patient's skin to avoid allergic reactions. Kelman held more than 100 patents for his instruments and innovations, and became known as the father of phacoemulsification. While attending medical school in Geneva, he regularly performed on two jazz radio shows and another on television. Just as his medical practice flourished, Kelman's celebrity grew after appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1975, where he sang a song about a blind girl and promoted his surgical innovations. He continued to appear regularly on television shows hosted by Merv Griffin, Barbara Walters, Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. Awards and honors \n\nIn 1970, Kelman was awarded by the American Academy of Achievement. In 1982, he was a recipient of the Congressional Salute in the U.S. Senate, 97th Congress, in Washington, D.C. The lecture series was named in his honor in 2003.

His first invention in 1962 was the cryoprobe which he used to freeze a cataractous lens before removal in intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), which removed the lens with the capsule intact. He began testing the procedure on animals in April 1966. In 1967, Kelman secretly conducted his first surgery on a blind patient, awaiting enucleation, who volunteered knowing that the procedure would not bring back his vision. His first patient's eye became infected and was removed. However, he was successful on subsequent attempts. Kelman's developments allowed the incision necessary for ECCE to be reduced from  to  and minimized recovery time. Kelman's critics said the procedure was \"ridiculous\" or \"malpractice\". That same year, the Kelman Satellite Teleconference was presented at the annual AAO conference, allowing the more than 400 in attendance to observe a live broadcast of Kelman performing five procedures. Hedy Lamarr, who Kelman treated in October 1980, said \"I was blind for more than seven years. At various times in his career, Kelman served as clinical professor of ophthalmology at New York Medical College and as an attending surgeon at the Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Later in his career, he invented a way to create collagen from a patient's skin to avoid allergic reactions. Kelman held more than 100 patents for his instruments and innovations, and became known as the father of phacoemulsification. While attending medical school in Geneva, he regularly performed on two jazz radio shows and another on television. Just as his medical practice flourished, Kelman's celebrity grew after appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1975, where he sang a song about a blind girl and promoted his surgical innovations. He continued to appear regularly on television shows hosted by Merv Griffin, Barbara Walters, Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. Awards and honors \n\nIn 1970, Kelman was awarded by the American Academy of Achievement. In 1982, he was a recipient of the Congressional Salute in the U.S. Senate, 97th Congress, in Washington, D.C. The lecture series was named in his honor in 2003. He also delivered the ASCRS's Binkhorst Lecture in 1989, the Ridley Medal Lecture at the International Congress of Ophthalmology in 1990, and the Arthur J. Bedell Memorial Lecture at Wills Eye Hospital in 1991. In June 1992, Kelman was awarded the National Medal of Technology from President George H. W. Bush. The following year, he received a Doctor of Letters from Thomas Jefferson University's Wills Eye Hospital Retina Service and the hospital also named its research facility the Charles D. Kelman Laboratory and Library. In 2003, Kelman received the Laureate Recognition Award from the AAO and the annual AAO Charles D. Kelman Lecture was established in 2005. In February 2004, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. He was also awarded the 2004 Lasker Award, with the jury making an exception to the rules to allow the award to be given posthumously. In January 2010, the New York public television station WLIW aired a documentary titled Through My Eyes: The Charlie Kelman Story; his autobiography published in 1985 was also titled Through My Eyes. Personal life and death \nKelman was an avid golfer and learned to fly a helicopter later in life. He and his first wife Joan Kelman (later Bernstein) had three children: David Joseph (who died in 2003), Lesley, and Jennifer. With his second wife Ann, he had three sons: Evan, Jason, and Seth.

Forceps serve a number of purposes, including pinching or moving tissue for a better view during a procedure; blood vessel compression to stop bleeding; extracting human tissue or foreign objects in the body that include sponges, splinters and other materials; cutting bone; and applying or removing sterile gauze or bandages. There are also forceps designed to perform specific medical related tasks like wire twisting. The variety of forceps available today reflect the need for instruments able to assist surgeons, nurses and other healthcare professionals with precision during specific types of procedures. Surgical forceps include items like vascular tissue forceps, bone cutting forceps, biopsy forceps, gall bladder forceps, hysterectomy forceps and intestinal forceps, to name a few. There are forceps designed for major or micro surgery. Specific-use forceps are also used for to perform tasks like removing objects from the ear, assisting with the delivery of a fetus, clamping a blood vessel to prevent bleeding, suturing and handling sterile materials. High quality surgical forceps are stainless steel instruments that are made with different designs and in a variety of sizes. Some are locking forceps that can remain in place in order to free up the hands of the physician during a procedure. The forceps category includes forceps that open and close like tongs, tweezers and curettes for scraping tissue. Forceps also have different shapes and blade angles to enable medical personnel to better access different areas of the body. They include straight and curved forceps; forceps with a slight bend in the blade tips for grasping; steep-angled forceps blades for hard to reach areas; and heavy-duty forceps that look like pliers. Forceps blades are straight, curved or hooked; serrated or smooth; and different sizes. Outlet forceps, also known as low forceps or pelvic forceps, is a type of obstetric forceps used during childbirth. These forceps are specialized instruments designed to assist in the delivery of the baby when there are certain complications or difficulties during the pushing stage. In the outlet forceps technique, the baby's head is already visible at the vaginal opening and the forceps are applied to grasp it. Outlet forceps are specifically designed to accommodate the shape and size of the baby's head, providing a gentle grip without causing harm. The forceps are then gently applied to the sides of the baby's head and traction is applied during contractions to guide the baby's head through the birth canal. The forceps-assisted delivery should be carried out by a skilled healthcare provider, typically an obstetrician or a specially trained midwife, to minimize any potential risks and complications. It is important to note that the use of forceps during childbirth is always carefully considered and reserved for certain situations where it is deemed necessary. The decision to use outlet forceps is based on several factors, including the mother's medical history, the condition of the baby, and the progress of labor. The healthcare provider will determine if the use of forceps is appropriate and will discuss the potential risks and benefits with the mother before proceeding. Overall, outlet forceps are a medical tool used to assist in the delivery of a baby when certain complications arise during labor. Obstetrical forceps are a medical instrument used in childbirth. Medical uses\n\nForceps births, like all assisted births, should only be undertaken to help promote the health of the mother or baby. In general, a forceps birth is likely to be safer for both the mother and baby than the alternatives – either a ventouse birth or a caesarean section – although caveats such as operator skill apply. Advantages of forceps use include avoidance of caesarean section (and the short and long-term complications that accompany this), reduction of delivery time, and general applicability with cephalic presentation (head presentation). Maternal factors for use of forceps:\n Maternal exhaustion. Fetal factors for use of forceps:\n Non-reassuring fetal heart tracing. Structure\n\nObstetric forceps consist of two branches (blades) that are positioned around the head of the fetus. The branches usually, but not always, cross at a midpoint, which is called the articulation. Most forceps have a locking mechanism at the articulation, but a few have a sliding mechanism instead that allows the two branches to slide along each other. Forceps with a fixed lock mechanism are used for deliveries where little or no rotation is required, as when the fetal head is in line with the mother's pelvis. Forceps with a sliding lock mechanism are used for deliveries requiring more rotation. The blade of each forceps branch is the curved portion that is used to grasp the fetal head. The forceps should surround the fetal head firmly, but not tightly. The blade characteristically has two curves, the cephalic and the pelvic curves. Forceps used for rotation of the fetal head should have almost no pelvic curve. Forceps with longer shanks are used if rotation is being considered. Short forceps are applied on the fetal head already descended significantly in the maternal pelvis (i.e., proximal to the vagina). Long forceps are able to reach a fetal head still in the middle or even in the upper part of the maternal pelvis. At present practice, it is uncommon to use forceps to access a fetal head in the upper pelvis. Long forceps are still in use elsewhere. These are used when there is substantial molding, that is, temporary elongation of the fetal head as it moves through the birth canal. Elliot forceps (1860) are similar to Simpson forceps but with an adjustable pin in the end of the handles which can be drawn out as a means of regulating the lateral pressure on the handles when the instrument is positioned for use. Kielland forceps (1915, Norwegian) are distinguished by having no angle between the shanks and the blades and a sliding lock. The pelvic curve of the blades is identical to all other forceps. Because the handles, shanks, and blades are all in the same plane the forceps can be applied in any position to affect rotation. Because the shanks and handles are not angled, the forceps cannot be applied to a high station as readily as those with the angle since the shanks impinge on the perineum. Wrigley's forceps, named after Arthur Joseph Wrigley, are used in low or outlet deliveries (see explanations below), when the maximum diameter is about  above the vulva. Wrigley's forceps were designed for use by general practitioner obstetricians, having the safety feature of an inability to reach high into the pelvis. Obstetricians now use these forceps most commonly in cesarean section delivery where manual traction is proving difficult. Piper's forceps has a perineal curve to allow application to the after-coming head in breech delivery. High forceps are never indicated in the modern era. Mid forceps can occasionally be indicated but require operator skill and caution. At this point, the two blades of the forceps are individually inserted, the left blade first for the commonest occipito-anterior position; posterior blade first if a transverse position, then locked. Outlet, low, mid or high\n\nThe accepted clinical standard classification system for forceps deliveries according to station and rotation was developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and consists of:\n Outlet forceps delivery, where the forceps are applied when the fetal head has reached the perineal floor and its scalp is visible between contractions. High forceps delivery is not performed in modern obstetrics practice. It would be a forceps-assisted vaginal delivery performed when the baby's head is not yet engaged. The forceps were used most notably in difficult childbirths. The forceps could avoid some infant deaths when previous approaches (involving hooks and other instruments) extracted them in parts. In the interest of secrecy, the forceps were carried into the birthing room in a lined box and would only be used once everyone was out of the room and the mother blindfolded. After this fundamental improvement, the forceps would become a common obstetrical instrument for more than two centuries. Tarnier's idea was to \"split\" mechanically the grabbing of the fetal head (between the forceps blades) on which the operator does not intervene after their correct positioning, from a mechanical accessory set on the forceps itself, the \"tractor\" on which the operator exercises traction needed to pull down the fetal head in the correct axis of the pelvic excavation. Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the cesarean section. Forceps had a profound influence on obstetrics as it allowed for the speedy delivery of the baby in cases of difficult or obstructed labour. Over the course of the 19th Century, many practitioners attempted to redesign the forceps, so much so that the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists' collection has several hundred examples. In the last decades, however, with the ability to perform a cesarean section relatively safely, and the introduction of the ventouse or vacuum extractor, the use of forceps and training in the technique of its use has sharply declined. Before the obstetrical forceps, this had to be done by cutting the baby out piece by piece. However, with the introduction of the obstetrical forceps the male doctor had a more important role. Although the use of the forceps in childbirth came with its own set of risks, the positives included a significant decrease in risk to the mother, a decrease in child morbidity, and a decrease risk to the baby. The forceps gave male doctors a way to deliver babies. In addition, with the use of forceps, male doctors invented lying in hospitals to provide safe, somewhat advanced obstetrical care because of the use of the obstetrical forceps. However, the introduction of obstetrical forceps also had a negative effect, because there was no medical oversight of childbirth by any kind of medical professional, this exposed the practice to unnecessary risks and complications for the fetus and mother. Furthermore, if the forceps' handler were to twist his or her wrist while the grip was on the baby's head, this would twist the baby's neck and cause damage to a cranial nerve, resulting in strabismus. The addition of obstetrical forceps came with complication to the mother during and after childbirth. In addition, the use of forceps could cause more difficulty evacuating during the recovery time as compared to a mother who did not use the forceps.

Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were wild horses and were probably hunted for meat. How and when horses became domesticated is disputed. The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated c. 2000 BCE. However, an increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes approximately 3500 BCE; recent discoveries in the context of the Botai culture suggest that Botai settlements in the Akmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse. Use of horses spread across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work, and warfare. As evidence, they note that zoologists have found no skeletal changes in the Botai horses that indicate domestication. Moreover, because they were hunted for food, the majority of the horse remains found in Botai-culture settlements indeed probably were wild. On the other hand, any domesticated riding horses were probably the same size as their wild cousins \n\n The inhabitants of Al-Magar, who lived in stone houses built with dry masonry, were one of the first communities in the world to practice the art of agriculture and animal husbandry before climate changes in the region resulted in desertification. Discoveries such as that of a large statue of a bridled horse indicates that the domestication of horses occurred about 9000 years ago in the Arabian peninsula, much earlier than in other parts of the world where domestication of the horse is thought to have occurred. The earliest evidence for small horse riding comes from the Sredny Stog communities of east Ukraine and with south Russia the domestication of the Bactrian camel date to c. 4000 BCE.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The most common criticisms concern various pre-existing sources that Quran relies upon, internal consistency, clarity and ethical teachings. According to Toby Lester, many Muslims find not only the religious fault-finding but also Western scholarly investigation of textual evidence \"disturbing and offensive\". The suras, also known as chapters of the Quran, are not placed in chronological order. Because the structure of the Quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen, Hadith were the main source of chronological order. The Hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context. He replied, \"O you, wrapped-up' (Al-Muddaththir).\" Surat Al-Alaq) Abu Huraira reported: We performed prostration along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (as he recited these verses: )\" When the heaven burst asunder\"(Al-Inshiqaq) and\" Read in the name of Thy Lord(Al-Alaq)\" The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.

Revelation of the Quran is described as being \"sent down\" in verse It is also called kalam allah — the word of God — and to most Muslims is eternal and uncreated attribute of God, as opposed to something written or created by God. Commonly, Injil and the Islamic notion of Torah are thought to be part of the Heavenly Quran. The idea of a holy book or other religious totem being based on an archetype preserved in heaven is not unique to Islam but goes back \"thousands of years\" to \"the early Summerians\" according to Alfred Guillaume.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Still, it had been no way for a boy to grow up, with a hole in his chest for everyone to stare at.He could not even feel it when visiting doctors touched the lung—or, rather, the thin, translucent leathery membrane covering the organ.It did not hurt; nor did it hinder his movements.What else could he do?He had learned to live with it as he grew into a man.But it had not killed Montgomery, either.The doctor, who had served in the army during the recent war with France, had blanched when he pulled back the boy's shirt to examine the wound. He'd announced that there would be no fixing the shattered bones. And it was big enough that three fingers and a thumb could be inserted. The man's strong hands had trembled as he took measurements. But it had not killed Montgomery, either. The man, a janitor, had struggled against his disease for a lifetime, already living decades beyond what doctors had predicted when he was born.The couple's troubled life story was laid out.Instead, Lawrence went back to the wife of the man wheezing on the ventilator at the University of Colorado Medical Center.Looking back at three previous years, however, he could find no single such lot.June 14\n\nDENVER\n\nWith his white shirts, plaid ties, black oxfords, and thinning dark hair that fell over earnest dark eyes, Dr. Dale Lawrence looked like everybody's favorite biology teacher in high school. He had to positively eliminate the chance that the man might have been involved in gay experiences or, perhaps, some kind of drug use or medication that could have engendered his immune deficiency. Maybe there was just one bad lot that was making people sick, and the Pneumocystis diagnosis was a wicked coincidence. Looking back at three previous years, however, he could find no single such lot. Instead, Lawrence went back to the wife of the man wheezing on the ventilator at the University of Colorado Medical Center.

He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and Stephen Jay Gould as \"the cleverest man I have ever known\". Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\". Early life and education \nMedawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \"towards the end of the war\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. And also because of its preference on sports, in which he was weak. His proudest moments at the college were with his teacher Ashley Gordon Lowndes, to whom he credited the beginning of his career in biology. He recognised Lowndes as barely literate but \"a very, very good biology teacher\". Young and Richard Julius Pumphrey. Yet Medawar was inherently weak in dissection and was constantly irked by their dictum: \"Bloody foolish is the boy whose drawing of his dissection differs in any way whatsoever from the diagram in the textbook.\" Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947. Reading the draft of the manuscript, Howard Florey commented that it was more philosophical than scientific. Santa J. Ono, the American immunologist, has described the enduring impact of this paper to modern science. Research outcomes \nMedawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 with Burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. It directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans, specifically kidney transplantation, carried out by an American physician Joseph Murray, who eventually received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Oxford, he at Magdalen and Taylor at Somerville College. Taylor's family objected to their marriage as Medawar had \"no background, and no money.\" Medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. John Young [probably referring to John Zachary Young] was not a PhD either. He was regarded as the philosopher Karl Popper's best-known disciple in science. He even asked his wife \"to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.\" Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:\n\nLater life and death \nIn 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual Reith Lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled The Future of Man, Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve. While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. It was, as he said, \"monstrous bad luck because Jim Whyte Black had not yet devised beta-blockers, which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career\". Medawar's failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. Awards and honours\n\nMedawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1949. With Frank Macfarlane Burnet he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\". He was awarded the UNESCO  Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1985. He was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1961 by the University of Birmingham. Medawar was awarded the 1987 Michael Faraday Prize \"for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture\". Since 2007, the lecture has been merged with two older ones honouring John Wilkins and John Desmond Bernal, and became Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Lecture and the accompanying award, Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Medal. Peter Brian Medawar Medal, awarded by the State Medical Academy of Rio de Janeiro. The University of Oxford has established a research consortium named the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research. Publications \nMedawar was recognised as a brilliant author. Richard Dawkins called him \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and New Scientist magazine's obituary called him \"perhaps the best science writer of his generation\". His books include\n\n The Uniqueness of the Individual, which includes essays on immunology, graft rejection and acquired immune tolerance. The author was a P. B. Medawar. The evidence that this was indeed the future Sir Peter Medawar—then a schoolboy of 15—was discussed in \"Gramophone\" in 1995 (\"‘Gramophone’, Die Meistersinger and immunology\", by John E. Havard, December 1995). Citations\n\nGeneral sources\n\nExternal links \n\n The Personal Papers of Peter Medwar are available for study at the Wellcome Collection. He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and Stephen Jay Gould as \"the cleverest man I have ever known\". Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\".

He was regarded as the philosopher Karl Popper's best-known disciple in science. He even asked his wife \"to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.\" Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:\n\nLater life and death \nIn 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual Reith Lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled The Future of Man, Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve. While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. It was, as he said, \"monstrous bad luck because Jim Whyte Black had not yet devised beta-blockers, which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career\". Medawar's failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. Awards and honours\n\nMedawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1949. With Frank Macfarlane Burnet he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\". He was awarded the UNESCO  Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1985. He was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1961 by the University of Birmingham. Medawar was awarded the 1987 Michael Faraday Prize \"for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture\". Since 2007, the lecture has been merged with two older ones honouring John Wilkins and John Desmond Bernal, and became Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Lecture and the accompanying award, Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Medal. Peter Brian Medawar Medal, awarded by the State Medical Academy of Rio de Janeiro. The University of Oxford has established a research consortium named the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research. Publications \nMedawar was recognised as a brilliant author. Richard Dawkins called him \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and New Scientist magazine's obituary called him \"perhaps the best science writer of his generation\". His books include\n\n The Uniqueness of the Individual, which includes essays on immunology, graft rejection and acquired immune tolerance. The author was a P. B. Medawar. The evidence that this was indeed the future Sir Peter Medawar—then a schoolboy of 15—was discussed in \"Gramophone\" in 1995 (\"‘Gramophone’, Die Meistersinger and immunology\", by John E.

Following the critical success of her debut, Knudsen has been considered one of the top Danish actresses of her generation. Knudsen has also received award nominations for her roles in Monas Verden (Mona's World) and Efter brylluppet (After the Wedding). Knudsen achieved international recognition for her leading role as fictional Danish Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg in the Danish TV series Borgen, and for her role as Theresa Cullen in the HBO science fiction-Western television series Westworld.

Ingham of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien of Georgia as Attorney General, and William T. Barry of Kentucky as Postmaster General. Jackson's first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip. Jackson blamed Adams in part for what was said about Rachel during the campaign, and refused to meet him after arriving in Washington. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would \"...kill him [Van Buren] dead, sir, kill him dead. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging. Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson, while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened. Later, in 1832, Calhoun, as vice president, cast a tie-breaking vote against Jackson's nomination of Van Buren as Minister to Great Britain in a failed attempt to end Van Buren's political career. ; Van Buren is honored on the AMERIPEX presidential issue of 1986.

Hedlund co-starred with Gwyneth Paltrow, Leighton Meester and his Friday Night Lights co-star, country musician Tim McGraw in the musical drama Country Strong, which was released on December 22, 2010. He recorded a number of songs for the film including \"Chances Are\" which appeared on Country Strong: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. His performance was well received by critics. Noting voice similarities between Hedlund and Charlie Robison, Roughstock said \"the best song on this album belongs to him\" and Country Weekly wrote that of all the songs performed by actors in this film, his was \"the most convincing\". Six other songs, including a duet with Meester, \n\n The following year, in 2010, Cassel played Thomas Leroy in Darren Aronofsky's critically acclaimed Black Swan (2010), alongside Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, which attracted considerable acclaim. For his performance in Black Swan, he was nominated alongside his cast for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Screen Daily praised his performance, writing that \"Cassel exudes otherworldly gravitas and his singular looks are perfect for the role.\" That year, he also starred in the German-Canadian historical film A Dangerous Method, directed by David Cronenberg; in the latter, he starred opposite Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, and Mortensen (marking their second \n\nMichael Dunn (born Gary Neil Miller, October 20, 1934 – August 30, 1973) was an American actor and singer. He inspired a number of actors significantly smaller and shorter (those with dwarfism) than most people, including Zelda Rubinstein, Eric the Actor, Mark Povinelli, and Ricardo Gil. As an adult, Dunn stood 3' 10\" and weighed about 78 pounds (117 cm, 35 kg). Early life\nDunn was born to Jewell (née Hilly; died 1990) and Fred Miller (died 1981) during the time of the Dust Bowl drought. He chose his stage name in order to differentiate himself from another Gary Miller in the Screen Actors Guild. However, according to his Columbia Studios press kit biography, his studies were interrupted when he was knocked down a flight of stairs during a \"student rush\", which resulted in a three-month hospital stay. However, he was a high spirited and well-known figure about campus who sang in the talent show and facetiously joined the football cheerleading squad. At various points, he held different odd jobs—singing in a nightclub, answering telephones for the  Miami Daily News, and working as a hotel detective. Dunn was later quoted in the New York Post explaining that he had wanted to be of service, since he was unfit for the military: \"Everyone my age was going to Korea and I had this feeling that singing wasn't exactly doing my part.\" Dunn left of his own accord on May 8, 1958, in order to pursue a stage career in New York. He also befriended actress Phoebe Dorin in an off-Broadway show, Two by Saroyan, in which both had small parts in the early 1960s. Eventually, on the advice of fellow actor Roddy McDowall, the pair started a nightclub act of songs mixed with conversational patter, titled \"Michael Dunn and Phoebe\". The act received favorable reviews in Time magazine and The New York Times and ultimately led directly to the pair being cast on The Wild Wild West television series, a Western spy spoof with elements of historical fiction and science fiction, which debuted in 1965. Dunn was probably best known for his recurring role on that series as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a mad scientist who devised passionately perverse schemes and gadgetry to ensnare Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin). According to Dorin, Dunn saved her from drowning during filming of the episode \"The Night of the Murderous Spring\", plunging underwater to tear her free, when her costume became entangled in machinery used to sink a boat on the set. Dunn appeared as Dr Loveless 10 times on The Wild Wild West (four times apiece in the first two seasons and one time apiece in the remaining two seasons). In the pilot episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry television spy spoof Get Smart, Dunn showed his skill with comic farce as the well-heeled gangster Mr. Big, leader of international crime organization K.A.O.S. He also appeared in an episode of Bonanza, \"It's a Small World\" (January 4, 1970), portraying a recently widowed circus performer trying to start a new life, and as a killer clown in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \"The Wax Men\" (5 March 1967). In 1963, he received the New York critics' Circle Award for best supporting actor and was nominated for a 1964 Tony Award, for his performance as Cousin Lymon in Edward Albee's stage adaptation of The Ballad of the Sad Café, by Carson McCullers. Dunn received an Oscar nomination and the Laurel Award as the best supporting actor for his role as the cynical Karl Glocken in Ship of Fools (Columbia Pictures, 1965, directed by Stanley Kramer). In 1969, The New York Times drama critic Clive Barnes praised Dunn's portrayal of Antaeus in the tragedy The Inner Journey by British novelist and playwright James Hanley, performed at the Lincoln Center: \"Michael Dunn as the dwarf is so good that the play may be worth seeing merely for him. Controlled, with his heart turned inward, his mind a pattern of pain, Mr. Dunn's Antaeus deserves all the praise it can be given.\" Between those career highlights, he accepted roles in many pulp horror movies, as well as a role in the 1968 film No Way to Treat a Lady, starring Rod Steiger and George Segal. However, at the time of his death, he was in London playing Birgito in The Abdication (Warner Brothers, 1974, directed by Anthony Harvey), starring Peter Finch and Liv Ullmann. Author Günter Grass had already asked him to play in a film adaptation of his novel, The Tin Drum, a role that ultimately went to the young David Bennent after Dunn's death. Various accounts describe him as an aviator, skydiver, judo master, football player, and concert pianist, despite clear evidence on film of a severe, waddling limp, permanently flexed limbs, and gnarled fingers. In published interviews, he did hint at his childhood limitations both in football—\"I was a great passer\"—and in baseball: \"I wasn't a very fast runner. I had to depend on sliding.\" He also received human transport from friend and stuntman Dean Selmier, who often carried Dunn on his shoulders through the streets of Manhattan. Dunn may have needed the drugs in order to tolerate the physical demands of shooting a movie.

Written in the key of G major, \"Hot \n\n \"Peacock\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry, taken from her third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). Because the song was filled with suggestive lyrics pertaining to male genitalia, Capitol Records initially opposed the idea of including it on her record. Similar to what happened with another song of hers – \"I Kissed a Girl\" (2008) – she refused to withdraw it from the record. \"Peacock\" was panned by music critics and, musically, was compared to the 1980s song \"Mickey\" by Toni Basil, and Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" (2005). When performing the track, the singer usually wears colorful or glittery clothing. \"I Hate Boys\" is a song recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera for her sixth studio album, Bionic (2010). Lyrically, it is a hate-driven song about ridiculing all boys. It was serviced to Australian radio on June 28, 2010, and released as a digital single in Australia and New Zealand on September 3. The song divided music critics; while some called it fun and a \"girl anthem\", others felt its lyrics were too juvenile and regarded it as filler. The song was written by Perry, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin and produced by Luke and Benny Blanco for her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). It was released as the album's second single on September 9, 2008. The lyrics address an unstable romantic relationship caused by a partner's mood swings. The song reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Perry's second consecutive top five single, following \"I Kissed a Girl\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Having been barred from releasing an album since 2007, the duo had had enough.

The park's centerpiece is Federal Hill, a former plantation home owned by United States Senator John Rowan in 1795. During the Rowan family's occupation, the mansion became a meeting place for local politicians and hosted several visiting dignitaries. Foster was a cousin of the Rowan family and reputedly an occasionally visitor to Federal Hill, though Foster was likely inspired to write the ballad by Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. After the popularity of the song increased throughout the United States, Federal Hill was purchased by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, dedicated as a historic site, and renamed \"My Old Kentucky Home\" on July 4, 1923. The Federal Hill mansion was featured on a U.S. postage stamp in 1992, and it is one of the symbols featured on the reverse of the Kentucky state quarter issued in 2001.

Although the song also is about the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, the city never officially adopted it as its theme song. My Old Kentucky Home is a short animation film originally released in June 1926, by Max and Dave Fleischer of Fleischer Studios as one of the Song Car-Tunes series. This cartoon features the original lyrics of \"My Old Kentucky Home\" (1853) by Stephen Foster, and was recorded in the Lee de Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system. My Old Kentucky Home appears to be the first attempt at animated dialogue in cartoon history, as an unnamed dog, an early prototype of future studio mascot Bimbo, in the film mouths the words \"Follow the ball, and join in, everybody\" in remarkable synchronization though the animation was somewhat limited, making sure that lip-synch was synchronized perfectly.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

'East Ocean Federation') and after 1947 as the Indochinese Federation (Fédération indochinoise; Liên đoàn Đông Dương), was a grouping of French colonial territories in Southeast Asia until its demise in 1954. It comprised Cambodia, Laos (from 1899), the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan (from 1898 until 1945), and the Vietnamese regions of Tonkin in the north, Annam in the centre, and Cochinchina in the south. The capital for most of its history (1902–45) was Hanoi; Saigon was the capital from 1887 to 1902 and again from 1945 to 1954. An all-out independence war, known as the First Indochina War, broke out in late 1946 between French and Viet Minh forces. To counter the Viet Minh, the State of Vietnam, led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, was proclaimed in 1949. Following the Geneva Accord of 1954, the French withdrew from Vietnam, which had been split into the two countries (until 1976), and French Indochina was no more. French Indochina was designated as a colonie d'exploitation (colony of economic exploitation) by the French government. The French administration established quotas of consumption for each Vietnamese village, thereby compelling villagers to purchase and consume set amounts of these monopolised goods. The colony's principal bank was the Banque de l'Indochine, established in 1875 and \n\n France obtained control over northern Vietnam following its victory over China in the Sino-French War (1884–85).

The region's economic development is also supported by the Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), established in 2010 as the private sector-led board comprising political and business leaders from around the city region. From the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline, with the advent of containerisation making the city's docks obsolete. Liverpool's economy has grown faster than the national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average — unusually low for an urban area. The inner city districts of Vauxhall, Everton, Edge Hill, Kensington and Toxteth mark the border with Liverpool city centre which consists of the L1, L2 and L3 postal districts. Liverpool was granted borough status in 1207, and the original seven streets of the settlement can now be found within the commercial district of Liverpool city centre. Many of Liverpool's most famous landmarks are located in the city centre and in 2006 Liverpool was visited by 625,000 international visitors alone, making it the fourth most visited city in the United Kingdom. Merseyside is a metropolitan and ceremonial county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey and sits within the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. Merseyside spans 249 sqmi of land. It borders the ceremonial counties of Lancashire (to the north-east), Greater Manchester (to the\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

It was formed as the Basildon District on 1 April 1974 from the former area of Basildon Urban District and the part of Thurrock Urban District that was within the Basildon New Town. The local authority is Basildon Borough Council. Basildon was a (famously) Conservative seat between 1979 and 1997 as the quintessential \"Essex man\" constituency based on the new town of Basildon. Both the successor seats that replaced Basildon in 2010 were considered to be much less favourable to Labour than the old Basildon seat, ending Basildon's bellwether status. Woodlands School is a secondary school in Basildon, Essex. The school currently educates more than 1600 students from Basildon and South East Essex. Occasional proposals have been made to move Billericay and Wickford to other districts, leaving Basildon more focused on the new town. The other, largest, population centre is commonly referred to as Basildon and comprises three original settlements: Laindon, Basildon and Pitsea (from west to east) which have merged with other minor settlements to form the New Town, which is a continuous urban area. The remaining land, approximately half of the district is designated as green belt, has several sites of \n\n Basildon depot is on Cherrydown East.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

A stand-alone sequel to 2015's Goosebumps, it is based on the children's horror book series of the same name by R. L. Stine. The plot follows two young boys who accidentally release the monsters from the Goosebumps franchise in their town after opening an unpublished Goosebumps manuscript titled Haunted Halloween, causing a wave of destruction on Halloween night. Unlike the previous \n\n One Day at HorrorLand is the sixteenth book in the original Goosebumps, the series of children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine.

While St. Trinity ultimately takes on a perverse aura as its rulers look to exploit the island paradise for tourism, Michael finds his hometown lifestyle transformed upon his return. Kristin discovers two boarding passes with Lara and Michael's names on them in his luggage. Michael is reduced to living on campus. But Yayati is traumatised when his father, Nahusha, dies, and for the first time he realises the destructive power of death. He is gripped by fear and helplessness. He later meets Alaka and experiences sisterly love. But Alaka ultimately falls prey to the Queen \n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. They won't talk about the blisters. They will talk about the pain. Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. In fact, I just had to email her the last night I worked to once again reset me. How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. In fact, when we do so, we are communicating that we are in the perfect position. from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" Have hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" It does a wonderful job of illuminating the darkness even at a distance. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. I have pondered this often. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. Choose wisely. The Valley of the Shadow. I have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\" The thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. It doesn't say \"through the valley of death.\" David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. Our dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? When my own father died, a close friend called the next morning. There was nothing better that could have been said. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home. That statement is so true. Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. I have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child. I have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. Jackson is only a year older than Emma, but he is in every way the \"big brother\". If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. Finally he moved away from the window and watched her on the big screen television above the window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love. I see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning. Don't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). For the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. So these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). As as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren. Emma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend. I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Only I'm not really alone, I still have to converse with Emma through the bathroom door where she waits for me to come out. .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. Emma's little voice is sweet to me, too. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. Let me tell you about Irene. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. .warm, sweet and irresistible. By the time we checked out, we felt as if we had known her forever. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. Before he was wheeled away to the hospital, the player on the cart waved to the fans to let them know he was better than we thought and again applause erupted from the stands. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. .I wonder if that plane will actually land or will it crash? Sometimes I wonder if people have forgotten that horrible morning of September 11, 2001. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. No wonder this attack shook the world. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later. As the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. let all the people praise Thee.\" The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" Of course, I knew it wasn't going to happen that way. There was little sleep. He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. There is no safe haven apart from Him. If that be the case, what have we to fear, of what cause is there to worry? .we can rest. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. My trek to Labor and Delivery was in every way unexpected. Ouch! Another ouch! I worked in the Cardiac department of that hospital for three months by the calendar and three years by how it felt to me. I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. The pace of time sped up. It reminds me of a ride on a roller coaster. Then the roller coaster takes it's first plunge and after that it only seems to go faster and faster. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. Your life is more than half over. Then the frightening thought begins.. . It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\" This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. \"This is how long you have left to live!\" But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. We were discussing when to stop making interventions in hopes of trying to save his father’s life. “It’s just one thing after another,” his son lamented when I told his family this news. Which direction was it really going? We didn’t know. His liver, on the other hand, was definitely coming back. Which could improve and which couldn’t? The answers changed every day as the enormous volume of data we collected on every aspect of his body’s function changed. Given enough time, all demented patients will become non-verbal and stop eating. Keeping a sharp eye on both, knowing which to believe more on any given day, is extremely challenging. In the end, my patient survived. But the injury to his brain proved extensive: he was no longer able communicate in any way other than through grunts and could no longer bathe, dress, or feed himself. I wanted to ask him if he was glad he’d survived, if we’d made the right choices for him. But it wasn’t clear to me at that point if he would have even understood the question. That’s so sad. I hoped when half way through the story it would have a happy ending but not so. Thank you for sharing your insight as a physician and as always, your wisdom and your compassion. I think I know his answer. Not me and not anyone I have asked. And I believe God was telling this man it was his time to die. No one listened and he is paying the price! To what end? Both my head and my heart tell me that comfort care is the path to follow. But the outcome—death—is the same. It just takes a lot longer. I don’t remember the author of this quote, but I think he had a point. It’s not enough to ask ALL patients’ families, What do you want done? We also need to help them understand that in some instances and at a certain point, interventions are futile. Patients with end-stage disease often live longer if they enter hospice programs than if they continue intensive medical interventions. So, how did the son/family feel about the outcome? Did he/they have any advance directives in place? Chris: I’m afraid I don’t know the answers to any of your questions except the last (and to that one, yes). Alex, I read your story with a heavy heart. Maybe now, as he lives, he doesn’t have an inclination of his total debility and need for total care? Isn’t end-stage dementia terribly hard on the family, with the pt not really understanding the degree of their debility? It was draining her financially and emotionally. It broke my heart seeing her in such sorrow, not being able to offer anything to her except listening. Maybe that was enough at that time? The cost is extremely high, both financially and emotionally. Does it have to do with the inability to let go, the fear of the unknown, and the fear of the emotional pain that comes with loss? I work with end-stage dementia often…no one is home upstairs, and yet, the family just wants them to be who they were…which will never happen. It truly saddens me. How sad. This man deserved comfort & palliative care. I know I wouldn’t want to survive in his condition. If we have never looked closely at end-of-life issues; if we have thought that those issues are only for medical people to think about/meditate upon; if we have never looked at a frail elderly person or a person with dementia and tried to imagine ourselves in his/her position; if we have never developed the habit of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes; if we have never learned to identify with another, not matter what their age or stage . then we will hang on and be unable to let go. We will be blind and fearful about decisions around end-of-life. Why do we set ourselves up to be blind and fearful?! Alex prompts us, with posts such as this, to consider our mortality and that of others. Never mind the anxiety that this consideration may bring. In time, the anxiety diminishes a little or a lot. Alex, thank you for an insightful essay. Oftentimes when I have “end-of-life” discussions with my well patients, to help them fill out their Living Will documents, they tell me of situations where a loved one had a living will but ended up with multiple interventions anyway, to no good end. Your case illustrates well how that happens: it is not always clear at the onset what that outcome will be. The difficulty, as you discuss, is in deciding when enough is enough. If we all had a crystal ball to look into the future, there are a lot of decisions we might make differently! We do the best we can with the information we have on hand, and sometimes people surprise us by full recovery when things have looked extremely bleak, and other times the outcome, sadly, is as you describe. And yet in that case, we are allowed to use our medical judgment and gently say no, it will not help. In those three months outside the ICU, I grew up ten years. And other than the last one day, he was conscious, he knew, he knew he was going. I count the days, I go on. Trying to see how things will turn out in the end. From a spiritual standpoint, I have the task of helping families turn to their faith and know that it’s ultimately ok to let their loved one go when the time comes. What I appreciate about this entry is how it clarified the issue. So often in these situations we carry on valiantly without pausing to consider the overall process of what’s going on. For myself, it’s the heartache caused by trying to do more, and more, with less and less effect that makes these types of circumstances so difficult, combined with the lack of easy answers to such dilemmas. It provides me a valuable reminder of the need to practice compassion when these situations arise; to extend it to all the people involved, and also to myself. I prayed that God would take her. The dementia had seen to that. I prayed that she would be released from this world. She would never want to live the way she was living. She came through the surgery with flying colors. She went on to recover quickly and fully and is walking again. My husband swears that she recovered as quickly as she did because she had no idea what was wrong and what was happening—she never worried about a thing. Her body is healthy but her mind is gone. It is so unfair. Barbara: It is so unfair. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It seems like relief from suffering is what people are hoping for (at least, suffering without a positive goal or purpose). I’ve heard it said that the spiral into dementia is thought by some to be a sort of unwinding of the brain as it loses function, but not necessarily felt as suffering by the individual. I often wondered how it seemed from her side. The relief from suffering of those around the patient seems to be a real puzzle, however. I would guess that the son feared this outcome, which is why he asked the question. I never doubted that we did the right thing. Your explanation of dementia—always fatal, loss of appetite and memory—was very helpful. She lived in Florida, near her daughter, who did everything possible to help her mom. One thing that is not addressed in the original post or any of the comments I’ve read so far is time. I do not think that having to make end-of-life decisions in that situation is comparable to making them for a person who has over the years succumbed to dementia or another progressive disease. There is TIME to think and accept in those situations. The major depression that sometimes follows traumatic brain injury is a doozy. Yet… he (not my husband, but another relative) has today told jokes, laughed at mine, and expressed a desire to die. How do you deal with that kind of mercurial change of mood? The point I want to make is that these kind of decisions cannot be addressed morally with policies or rules written by bureaucrats—each case is different. OMG, I am feeling terrible, watching this helpless man. The story itself is repeating from time to time and people getting caught and diagnosed too many times too late. In Mile End, Montreal, Adam Levy, a Jewish teenager, falls in love with Yasmine Gibran, a Lebanese girl… On his way to audition for music school, Adam meets Yasmine, who is participating in a student protest. Adam, handsome and shy, and Yasmine, exquisite and passionate, are instantly drawn to one another. Adam fears that his orthodox Rabbi grandfather, who he's lived with since his parents were killed in Israel, will stop at nothing to end his relationship with \"the Arab girl\". The renewed conflict in the Middle East feels closer and closer to home, as Yasmine's life dives into a tailspin when she learns that her mother has gone missing in bombarded Beirut.

He is featured in the books Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, and their corresponding film adaptations, and the novel Midnight Sun—a re-telling of the events of Twilight from Edward's perspective. Edward is a telepathic vampire who, over the course of the series, falls in love with, marries, and fathers a child with Bella Swan, a human teenager who later chooses to become a vampire as well. In the Twilight film series, Edward is played by actor Robert Pattinson. Since the release of the Twilight series, the character of Edward has developed somewhat of a cult following, with millions of devoted, mostly female, fans worldwide. Gina R. Dalfonzo of the National Review Online described Edward's character as mentally unstable and a \"predator\", using behavioral examples such as spying on Bella while she sleeps, eavesdropping on her conversations, dictating her choice of friends, and encouraging her to deceive her father as reasons why Dalfonzo believes he is \"one of modern fiction's best candidates for a restraining order.\" In addition to the traits he shares with his fellow vampires, Edward has certain abilities that are his alone. Edward is \n\n Edward Cullen (born Edward Anthony Masen) is Bella's primary love interest. As stated in the first and second novels, he was born on June 20, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, and was frozen in his 17-year-old body while dying of the Spanish influenza, when he was changed into a vampire by Dr. Carlisle Cullen. As shown in Twilight, Carlisle only did so because Edward's dying mother, Elizabeth, begged him to save Edward. Edward knows that he could kill Bella easily, a fact that torments him so much that, in the book New Moon, he decided to leave Forks with his family so they wouldn't be able to hurt her. Edward marries Bella in Breaking Dawn and they have a daughter, Renesmee. Robert Pattinson plays Edward in the Twilight film series.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

In 1976, Chapman was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to five years in a Texas prison. Chapman served 18 months at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Chapman came to international notice as a bounty hunter for his successful capture of Max Factor heir Andrew Luster in Mexico in 2003 and, the following year, was given his own series, Dog the Bounty Hunter (2004–2012), on A&E. Chapman, after decades of bounty hunting, was featured on Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. This led him and the show's production company to do a spin-off about his work in capturing bail fugitives, in particular Chapman's efforts in hunting down Andrew Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. By now Chapman's profile had come to the attention of the American public. Chapman was born as son of Duane Chapman Sr. and his first wife, La Fonda Sue Darnall (née Honeycutt). Chapman spent his early years in Pampa, Texas, but during his teen years, moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a teenager Chapman ran away from home, began skipping school, and joined a gang. At seventeen, Chapman began training in boxing and mixed martial arts with the help of his good friend Sonny Westbrook (who has appeared many times on Dog the Bounty Hunter). On September 14, 2006, Leland Chapman was arrested along with Duane \"Dog\" Chapman and Tim Chapman by U.S.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Molly Cates is a journalist with the Lone Star Monthly, who interviewed Mordecai two years previously and is the only person outside the cult to have had any contact with him. The book is set in the last four days of the siege and has two narrative streams: one of them underground, as the driver battles to keep up the spirit of the children and prepare for the end of the fifty days; the other follows Molly Cates as she investigates Mordecai's past to find a key to breaking his fanatical resolve as it becomes increasingly apparent that the children are to be sacrificed as part of his apocalyptic plan.

Mao Zedong worked in the library there, where he was among the leaders of the May Fourth Movement that lent its name to Wusi Street, an experience that later led him to help found the Communist Party of China. The university moved out to a larger campus in the Haidian District when Mao established the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the Honglou is now a museum. Shortly after the university moved, Mao established the Central Academy of Drama, the only institution of higher education currently in the district.

It was formed as the Basildon District on 1 April 1974 from the former area of Basildon Urban District and the part of Thurrock Urban District that was within the Basildon New Town. The local authority is Basildon Borough Council. Basildon was a (famously) Conservative seat between 1979 and 1997 as the quintessential \"Essex man\" constituency based on the new town of Basildon. Both the successor seats that replaced Basildon in 2010 were considered to be much less favourable to Labour than the old Basildon seat, ending Basildon's bellwether status. Apart from some small industrial areas and a modest but busy shopping area, Shenfield serves predominantly as a dormitory town for commuters to London and surrounding towns such as Romford and Basildon. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and St Mary's primary school is located nearby. The town of Hutton, to the east of Shenfield, is now largely part of the built-up area. Basildon depot is on Cherrydown East.

Jeremy Poldark continues the story of the Poldark marriage and family. The previous novel in the series (Demelza) ended on several dark notes in January 1790. Jeremy Poldark closes in June 1791, one month after the birth of the child for whom the novel is named. During the course of the novel, Ross defends himself in court, sells his interest in Wheal Leisure, enters into partnership with a smuggler, deepens his quarrel with George Warleggan, continues his admiration of Elizabeth Poldark, grows in his understanding of Demelza's virtues, and mends his estrangement with Francis Poldark. The third season is based on the first half of the novel A Storm of Swords. Benioff had previously said that A Storm of Swords would need to be adapted in two seasons on account of its length. According to Benioff, the third season contains a particularly memorable scene from A Storm of Swords, the prospect of filming which was part of their motivation to adapt the novels for television in the first place. Poldark is a British historical drama television series based on the novels of the same title by Winston Graham and starring Aidan Turner in the lead role. The first series was based on the first two Poldark novels by Graham. It is the second screen adaptation of Graham's novels, following a television series broadcast by BBC One between 1975 and 1977.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

He is nearly killed by a Trade Federation transport, only to be saved at the last minute by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Qui-Gon and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), persuade Jar Jar's tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans. After the death of Qui-Gon, he becomes the Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi. During the invasion, Qui-Gon rescues a Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, \n\n fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

From 1834 until 1952, Zwickau was the seat of the government of the south-western region of Saxony.

Relations quickly improved following the establishment of the Vainakhish Republic as a sovereign entity within the Soviet Union. In September 1989, at the 2nd Congress of the Ingush people, some participants used terms such as \"Vainakhish people\" and \"Vainakhish nation\". It includes the historic lands of Vainakh Chechnya, Ingushetia, the eastern part of North Ossetia and parts of north and west Dagestan. In 2004, rebels attempted to create a Vainakh republic by merging Chechnya and Ingushetia. The region was originally known as the Chechen-Ingush ASSR when it was established in 1934. The Chechens and Ingush were among the many people who were forcibly relocated by Joseph Stalin, but were allowed to return by the early 1960s. After Chechnya made its initial declaration of sovereignty, the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic split in two in June 1992 amidst the Ingush armed conflict against another Russian republic, North Ossetia. The newly created republic of Ingushetia then joined the Russian Federation, while Chechnya declared full independence from Moscow in 1993 as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the early 2000s. In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The name comes from the Jamaican Patois term riddim, which refers to the instrumental of dub, reggae and dancehall music. It is said that those who enjoy this style of music describe it as \n\n The music website Allmusic has described dubstep's overall sound as \"tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals.\" According to Simon Reynolds, dubstep's constituents originally came from \"different points in the 1989—99 UK lineage: bleep 'n' bass, jungle, techstep, Photek-style neurofunk, speed garage, [and] 2 step.\" Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the 2-step \n\n In Jamaica, a form of popular electronic music emerged in the 1960s, dub music, rooted in sound system culture. Dub music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, King Tubby, Errol Thompson, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, and Scientist, producing reggae-influenced experimental music with electronic sound technology, in recording studios and at sound system parties. Despite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge. King Tubby, for example, was a sound system proprietor and electronics technician, whose small front-room studio in the Waterhouse ghetto of western Kingston was a key site of dub music creation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Nazi Germany's overall plan was to invade the Low Countries which would make the French and British troops leave their current position and position their forces in Belgium. Then, a second force would navigate through the Ardennes Forest and move around the Maginot Line at the weakest part of the Allied defences. The Germans would then capture Paris, eliminate any resistance that remained, cross the English Channel, and invade the United Kingdom. ; 13 May - German armies open 60-mile wide breach in Maginot Line at Sedan. ; 19 May - General Maxime Weygand replaces Maurice Gamelin as commander-in-chief of all French forces. ; 20 May - German forces, under General Erwin Rommel, reach the English Channel. ; 26 May - Dunkirk evacuation of British Expeditionary Force starts. ; 3 June - Paris is bombed \n\n The German invasion of the Netherlands (Slag om Nederland) was a military campaign part of Case Yellow (Fall Gelb), the German invasion of the Low Countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and France during World War II. The German Luftwaffe used paratroopers in the capture of several airfields in the vicinity of Rotterdam and The Hague, helping to quickly overrun the country and immobilise Dutch forces. The best, most modernised French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost their best heavy weaponry and their best armored formations. Between May and June, French forces were in general retreat and Germany threatened to occupy Paris. While French resistance continued with the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle, the surrender of Metropolitan France ended any further attempts by the British to unite the two countries. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. From 1940 to 1942, while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

The peoples of Middle-earth vary from the hobbits of The Shire in the Northwest, evil \"Easterlings\" in the East, and \"imperial sophistication and decadence\" in the South. Indeed, while Middle-earth was still \"in a twilight under the stars\", the \"oldest living things had arisen: ... on earth, the shadows of great trees\". For Tolkien critic Tom Shippey, the mention of Mirkwood is an echo of the Norse mythology of the Elder Edda, with the pathless forests of the North over the \n\n outside Time itself maybe\". Both for Tolkien personally, and in his Middle-earth writings, caring about trees really mattered. Tolkien.\" Tolkien stated that primeval human understanding was communion with other living things; critics note that Middle-earth was set in the distant past, when primeval forests still existed. In her view, this makes sense in terms of theology, and indeed in a mythology like The Silmarillion: but a novel like The Lord of the Rings demanded rounded characters rather than symbols of good or of evil.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

By the 1870s, gin was becoming increasingly popular and many of the finer establishments in England were serving pink gins. According to some unconfirmed accounts, gin originated in Italy.

Gin is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe, particularly in southern France, Flanders and the Netherlands, to provide aqua vita from distillates of grapes and grains. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor that was originally a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange–led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured, gin-based liqueurs, for example sloe gin, traditionally produced by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Biographer Dennis Fischer says it was Nimoy's \"most important role,\" and Nimoy was later credited by others for bringing \"dignity and intelligence to one of the most revered characters in science fiction.\" Originally played by actor Leonard Nimoy, Spock first appeared in the original Star Trek series serving aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer and first officer, and later as commanding officer of two iterations of the vessel. After retiring from active duty in Starfleet, Spock serves as a Federation \n\n Nimoy made his directorial debut in 1973, with the \"Death on a Barge\" segment for an episode of Night Gallery during its final season. It was not until the early 1980s that Nimoy resumed directing on a consistent basis, ranging from television shows to motion pictures. Nimoy directed the second most successful movie (critically and financially) in the franchise, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), and then Three Men and a Baby, the highest-grossing film of 1987. From 1967 to 1970, Nimoy had a music career with Dot Records, with his first and second albums being mostly recorded in character of Spock. After the original Star Trek series, Nimoy starred in Mission: Impossible for two seasons, hosted the documentary series In Search of..., and made several well-received stage appearances. Nimoy's portrayal of Spock made a significant cultural impact and earned him three Emmy Award nominations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Frisians are also known to have founded the Freston area of Ipswich. As climatic conditions improved, there was another mass migration of Germanic peoples into the area from the east. This is known as the \"Migration Period\" (Volksverhuizingen). The northern Netherlands received an influx of new migrants and settlers, mostly Saxons, but also Angles and Jutes. Many of these migrants did not stay in the northern Netherlands but moved on to England and are known today as the Anglo-Saxons. Around the 7th century a wave of Frisian migrants moved to several islands in the North Sea, and a second wave moved to what is now Nordfriesland in northern Germany and South Jutland in southern Denmark in the 11th century. The English people are an ethnic group and nation native to England, who speak the English language and share a common history and culture. Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD. The English largely descend from two main historical population groups – the tribes who settled in southern Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans (including Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians), and the partially Romanised Britons already living there.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Written and produced by Cyrus and Oren Yoel, \"Inspired\" is a country ballad about creating a difference in the world. Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign inspired Cyrus to write the track, which references her father Billy Ray and her childhood in Tennessee.

About 5–10% of cases of ALS are directly inherited from a person's parents. Overall, first-degree relatives of an individual with ALS have a 1% risk of developing ALS. ALS has an oligogenic mode of inheritance, meaning that mutations in two or more genes are required to cause disease. C9orf72 is the most common gene associated with ALS, causing 40% of familial cases of ALS, as well as a small percentage of sporadic cases; it also causes about 25% of familial cases of frontotemporal dementia. People without ALS tend to have fewer than 25 repeat units, while people with ALS due to a mutation in C9orf72 tend to have hundreds or thousands of repeat units. SOD1, which codes for superoxide dismutase 1, is the second most common gene associated with ALS and causes about 12% of familial cases and about 2% of sporadic cases. More than 150 mutations in SOD1 have been described, almost all of which have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The four main genes associated with FTD–ALS are C9orf72, CHCHD10, SQSTM1, and TBK1. Additionally, about 15% of people with FTD have symptoms of motor neuron dysfunction that resemble ALS. These associations include:\n\nOther genes\nThe following genes associated with ALS have been discussed in a June 2018 literature review, but have not yet been added to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. SOD1 \n\nIn 1993, scientists discovered that mutations in the gene (SOD1) that produces the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme were associated with around 20% of familial ALS and 5% of sporadic ALS. To date, over 110 different mutations in SOD1 have been linked with the disorder, some of which (such as  H46R) have a very long clinical course, while others, such as A4V, are exceptionally aggressive. When the defenses against oxidative stress fail, programmed cell death (apoptosis) is upregulated. 8-oxoG accumulates in the mitochondria of spinal motor neurons of persons with ALS. In transgenic ALS mice harboring a mutant SOD1 gene, 8-oxoG accumulates in mitochondrial DNA of spinal motor neurons. Thus oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA of motor neurons due to altered SOD1 may be a significant factor in the etiology of ALS. Mutations in UBQLN2 interfere with protein degradation, leading to neurodegeneration and causing dominantly inherited, chromosome X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. As a result, motor neurons can no longer produce a functional autophagosome leading to the inhibition of autophagy. Mitochondria\n\nMitochondrial abnormalities, such as increased free radical production and impaired ATP production, have been observed but these mechanisms are unproven causes of ALS. SOD1 and TDP-43 mutations may play a role in causing mitochondria dysfunction. Increased markers of oxidative stress have been observed in sporadic cases of ALS, including 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-Hydroxynonenal. This hypothesis is further supported by various risk factors observed for ALS, such as trauma and exposure to certain chemicals that may play a role in increasing oxidative stress. One proposed mechanism of ALS incorporating both the genetic mutations of RNA binding proteins and oxidative stress, suggests that with age cells lose their ability to buffer against the genetic changes due to increasing oxidative stress resulting in the death of sensitive cells. It was the first time that linkage analysis was successful in identifying the genetic cause of a rare neurodegenerative disorder.

References\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\n Motor neuron diseases or motor neurone diseases (MNDs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body. They include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), pseudobulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA), as well as some rarer variants resembling ALS. Motor neuron diseases affect both children and adults. While each motor neuron disease affects patients differently, they all cause movement-related symptoms, mainly muscle weakness. Most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes, but some forms are inherited. Studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes (e.g. SOD1) that are thought to be important in understanding how the disease occurs. Symptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life. Most of these diseases worsen over time; while some, such as ALS, shorten one's life expectancy, others do not. Currently, there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders, and care is mostly symptomatic.

This hypothesis is further supported by various risk factors observed for ALS, such as trauma and exposure to certain chemicals that may play a role in increasing oxidative stress. One proposed mechanism of ALS incorporating both the genetic mutations of RNA binding proteins and oxidative stress, suggests that with age cells lose their ability to buffer against the genetic changes due to increasing oxidative stress resulting in the death of sensitive cells. It was the first time that linkage analysis was successful in identifying the genetic cause of a rare neurodegenerative disorder. SOD1 is one of the most common genes associated with ALS, accounting for about 12% of fALS and 1-2% of sALS. VCP was identified in 2010 and accounts for 1% of fALS and 1% of sALS; ATXN2, OPTN, and UBQLN2 were associated with ALS that same year. C21orf2, CCNF, and NEK1 were associated with ALS in 2016. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ALS was published in 2007, and 14 GWASs total had been published through 2013. In outbred populations, thousands of cases (people with ALS) and controls (people without ALS) are required for a GWAS to have sufficient statistical power to confidently identify a gene's association with ALS. References\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nThere are more than 25 genes known to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as of June 2018, which collectively account for about 70% of cases of familial ALS (fALS) and 10% of cases of sporadic ALS (sALS). About 5–10% of cases of ALS are directly inherited from a person's parents. Overall, first-degree relatives of an individual with ALS have a 1% risk of developing ALS. ALS has an oligogenic mode of inheritance, meaning that mutations in two or more genes are required to cause disease. C9orf72 is the most common gene associated with ALS, causing 40% of familial cases of ALS, as well as a small percentage of sporadic cases; it also causes about 25% of familial cases of frontotemporal dementia. People without ALS tend to have fewer than 25 repeat units, while people with ALS due to a mutation in C9orf72 tend to have hundreds or thousands of repeat units. It is not clear exactly how many repeat units are needed to cause disease. SOD1, which codes for superoxide dismutase 1, is the second most common gene associated with ALS and causes about 12% of familial cases and about 2% of sporadic cases. More than 150 mutations in SOD1 have been described, almost all of which have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The four main genes associated with FTD–ALS are C9orf72, CHCHD10, SQSTM1, and TBK1. Additionally, about 15% of people with FTD have symptoms of motor neuron dysfunction that resemble ALS. These associations include:\n\nOther genes\nThe following genes associated with ALS have been discussed in a June 2018 literature review, but have not yet been added to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. SOD1 \n\nIn 1993, scientists discovered that mutations in the gene (SOD1) that produces the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme were associated with around 20% of familial ALS and 5% of sporadic ALS. To date, over 110 different mutations in SOD1 have been linked with the disorder, some of which (such as  H46R) have a very long clinical course, while others, such as A4V, are exceptionally aggressive. When the defenses against oxidative stress fail, programmed cell death (apoptosis) is upregulated. 8-oxoG accumulates in the mitochondria of spinal motor neurons of persons with ALS. In transgenic ALS mice harboring a mutant SOD1 gene, 8-oxoG accumulates in mitochondrial DNA of spinal motor neurons. Thus oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA of motor neurons due to altered SOD1 may be a significant factor in the etiology of ALS. Mutations in UBQLN2 interfere with protein degradation, leading to neurodegeneration and causing dominantly inherited, chromosome X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. As a result, motor neurons can no longer produce a functional autophagosome leading to the inhibition of autophagy. Mitochondria\n\nMitochondrial abnormalities, such as increased free radical production and impaired ATP production, have been observed but these mechanisms are unproven causes of ALS. SOD1 and TDP-43 mutations may play a role in causing mitochondria dysfunction. Increased markers of oxidative stress have been observed in sporadic cases of ALS, including 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-Hydroxynonenal. This hypothesis is further supported by various risk factors observed for ALS, such as trauma and exposure to certain chemicals that may play a role in increasing oxidative stress.

Producer Al Ruddy eventually made a deal with the league and Joe Colombo to cut the word Mafia from the script, and the league would back the production of the film. It was in 1971, when Montana was acting as a bodyguard for a senior Colombo Family member, that he met Francis Ford Coppola and Al Ruddy. None of his architectural productions are mentioned, and there remain but a few of his etchings, all of which were reproductions of his paintings. One of his pictures, \"St. Basil dictating his doctrine\", is in the Louvre, and another, \"St. Matthew\", is in the Dresden Gallery. Herrera left two sons, \"el Rubio\" (the ruddy) who died before he fulfilled the great promise of his youth, and \"el Mozo\" (the younger). He was also the godfather of the Spanish-born Portuguese painter Josefa de Óbidos. When the company vice-president Samuel Z. Arkoff received The Beast with a Million Eyes he was unhappy that it did not even feature \"the beast\" that was implicit in the title. Paul Blaisdell, responsible for the film's special effects, was hired to create a three-foot-tall spaceship (with \"beast\" alien) for a meager $200. Notably, the Art Director was Albert S. Ruddy, who would later win two \"Best Picture\" Academy Awards for The Godfather (1972) and Million Dollar Baby (2004).

A light comedy of manners, the play is a satire on \"Modern Art\", criticism, artistic pretension and the value placed on art. It is set in Paris in 1956 and portrays the effect on the family and associates of a famous artist when it is revealed after his death that he painted none of the pictures signed by him and sold for large sums. Its original London production, opening on 7 November 1956, was successful, running for more than a year, starring, successively, John Gielgud, Michael Wilding and Robert Helpmann. Coward played the lead role in the Broadway production in 1957. The play's opening scene shows Sir Humphrey Dryground, a member of the landed gentry, mortgaging his last estate to an old usurer called Vermine. Dryground expresses his remorse over his past actions; he says that his \"project\" in mortgaging his estate involves reparations to Brookall, and he proposes an arranged marriage between the \n\n In the first scene, Max accuses his distant and travelling wife, Charlotte, of adultery. The audience is gradually led to realize that Charlotte is an actress, and the first scene was her performance in a play that Henry, her husband, wrote. As they walk from room to room, they watch as bumbling Silvano (Bo) attempts to hide his two girlfriends, Charlotte (Chaplin) and Emily (Birkin), from each other in this same crowded apartment. While the actors feel frustrated at the shambles of a set they must work with, the play's author, Clément Roquemaure (Kalfon), is silently auditioning them for his new play, to be held at his strangely empty mansion. As the rehearsal progresses, the two actresses' visions start to unearth a romantic calamity that took place at the mansion. Distraught, Agatha tells him that there is no certificate: she was seduced at the age of seventeen by Baron Wildenhaim upon promise of marriage.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

From that time many people began to approach the monk with their needs, but he sought complete solitude and fled to the Rouva wilderness, where he dwelt five years more. There, he lived and worked for about 2 years but was not permitted to become a monk. As he rang the bell for prayer one day, the rope broke and after this he was required to leave this monastery. Subsequently, he became known for his saintly life, silence and asceticism. Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria said of Saint Yustos that \"he is the living example of the 4th century monks\". Separation from the world for contemplative prayer is essential to the life of the Carmelite Monks, their monasteries are founded in the mountains to ensure geographical enclosure. In modern times where noise abounds, the monks desire true silence and an atmosphere of natural solitude. The monks explain how the mountains provide this: \"In the mountains, often wild and remote, the soul can make a swift journey towards union with God; the beauty of the wilderness alone raises the mind and heart to the Eternal Father who created the things of this world. This reflects the continual effort of Carmelites throughout the centuries to return to the eremitical life of a hermit in the mountains in imitation of Elijah from the Book of Kings in the Old Testament. They are known for their loyalty to the Magisterium of the Catholic Church and to the ancient traditions of Carmel. Their life includes strict separation from the world and the living of the cloistered Carmelite spirituality and way of life established by St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Jesus. In accord with the Carmelite Rule, they engage in manual labor and the study of Carmelite spirituality in the solitude of the mountains, with the firm hope of attaining to Union with God.

In March 2015 the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) refused to issue a certificate to the film for a video-on-demand release, stating: \"It is the Board's carefully considered conclusion that the unremitting manner in which [the film] focuses on physical and sexual abuse, aggravated by racist invective, means that to issue a classification to this work, even if confined to adults, would be inconsistent with the Board's Guidelines, would risk potential harm, and would be unacceptable to broad public opinion.\" James Cullen Bressack commented that he was \"honoured to know that [his] mind is officially too twisted for the UK.\" Though some reacted positively to the ban, which was the BBFC's first (and as of 2018 only) complete refusal of certification since 2011's The Bunny Game, Bressack stated: \"As a Jewish man, and a victim of anti-Semitic hate, I made a horror film that depicts the very thing that haunts my dreams.

One major factor is political turmoil in Cuba, such as the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s and subsequent communist regime under Fidel Castro. Economic factors have also played a role in Cuban migration. Difficult economic conditions in Cuba, including limited job opportunities, low wages, and a centrally planned economy, have driven many Cubans to seek better economic prospects in the USA. Furthermore, migration has created a sense of nostalgia and attachment to Cuba among Cuban-Americans. Born in Jonesville, Virginia, Williams received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Milligan College in 1940, and enrolled in the fall of 1941 at the University of Virginia School of Law. After the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the United States Navy, having never seen the ocean. During his officer training, he was a roommate of Herman Wouk, who told of their experiences in the opening chapter of The Caine Mutiny.

His writing is clear, concrete, down to earth and based on his observations of children and how they learn from what interests them.

As with all of his books, this work exhibits the great respect he had for children and insights into how they learn. John explores how children learn and think and demonstrates that children can and do pick up \"the basics\" (reading, writing, math) from the world around them. But it conveys also the ambivalence of the 1980s period of perestroika in which it was written.

It is about a woman on death row for killing a man. She is best known for her collaborations with her husband, filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Oculus (2013), Hush (2016; she also wrote the screenplay with him), Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016), and Gerald's Game (2017), as well as in his television series The Haunting of Hill House (2018), The Haunting of Bly Manor (2020) and Midnight Mass (2021). Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Today, local barbecue restaurants use a specific meat in their recipes, usually pork, chicken, or mutton, which, along with the spices used, creates a flavor unique to each restaurant. Typically, since burgoo is a slow-cooked dish, the starch from the added vegetables results in thickening of the stew. In addition, soup bones can be added for taste and thickening. The ingredients are combined in order of cooking time required, with meat first, vegetables next, and thickening agents as necessary.

Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, taking pills that contain estrogen without progesterone, a history of tamoxifen use, late menopause, and a family history of the condition. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include prior radiation therapy to the pelvis. A diagnosis of uterine sarcoma may be suspected based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, and medical imaging. Endometrial cancer can often be cured while uterine sarcoma typically is harder to treat. Endometrial cancer is relatively common while uterine sarcomas are rare. In the United States, uterine cancers represent 3.5% of new cancer cases. Types \nThe terms uterine cancer and womb cancer may refer to several different types of cancer that occur in the uterus, namely:\n\nEndometrial cancer \n\n Endometrial carcinomas originate from cells in the glands of the endometrium (uterine lining). These include the common and readily treatable well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, as well as the more aggressive uterine papillary serous carcinoma and uterine clear-cell carcinoma. Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors (also known as uterine carcinosarcomas) are rare endometrial tumors which show both glandular (carcinomatous) and stromal (sarcomatous) differentiation. Uterine sarcomas \n\nLeiomyosarcomas originate from the muscular layer of the uterus (or myometrium). Endometrial stromal sarcomas originate from the connective tissues of the endometrium, and are far less common than endometrial carcinomas. Treatment \nTreatment of uterine cancer may differ depending on the type of cancer and staging of the tumor. For endometrial cancer, five main types of treatments are used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The most common treatment modality for endometrial cancer is surgery, whereby the uterus is removed via a total hysterectomy. Prognosis \nPrognosis varies for the different types of endometrial cancer. Factors that influence prognosis across types of uterine cancer are age at diagnosis, the stage of the cancer, the grade of the cancer, histology, depth of invasion into the myometrium, and the presence of spread to nearby lymph nodes or other regions. Endometrial cancer typically has a good 5-year-survival when diagnosed early. Generally, the prognosis is poorer for uterine sarcomas as compared to endometrial cancers. Epidemiology\n\nUterine cancer effects approximately 3.1% of females during their lifetime. Uterine cancer resulted in 45,000 deaths worldwide in 1990, with this number increasing to 58,000 deaths in 2010. North America and Northern Europe have the highest rates of uterine cancer. About 81% of women with uterine cancer survive for five years. United States\n\nUterine cancer has a high prevalence in the United States, with approximately 772,247 women with the disease in 2016. In the United States, uterine cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic cancer. The rates of incidence and death for uterine cancer differ depending on race. For the death rates of uterine cancer, black females had the highest rates, 8.5 deaths per 100,000 persons.

Factors that influence prognosis across types of uterine cancer are age at diagnosis, the stage of the cancer, the grade of the cancer, histology, depth of invasion into the myometrium, and the presence of spread to nearby lymph nodes or other regions. Endometrial cancer typically has a good 5-year-survival when diagnosed early. Generally, the prognosis is poorer for uterine sarcomas as compared to endometrial cancers. Epidemiology\n\nUterine cancer effects approximately 3.1% of females during their lifetime. Uterine cancer resulted in 45,000 deaths worldwide in 1990, with this number increasing to 58,000 deaths in 2010. North America and Northern Europe have the highest rates of uterine cancer. About 81% of women with uterine cancer survive for five years. United States\n\nUterine cancer has a high prevalence in the United States, with approximately 772,247 women with the disease in 2016. In the United States, uterine cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic cancer. The rates of incidence and death for uterine cancer differ depending on race. For the death rates of uterine cancer, black females had the highest rates, 8.5 deaths per 100,000 persons.

Endometrial cancer forms from the lining of the uterus, and uterine sarcoma forms from the muscles or support tissue of the uterus. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, taking pills that contain estrogen without progesterone, a history of tamoxifen use, late menopause, and a family history of the condition. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include prior radiation therapy to the pelvis. A diagnosis of uterine sarcoma may be suspected based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, and medical imaging. Endometrial cancer can often be cured while uterine sarcoma typically is harder to treat. Endometrial cancer is relatively common while uterine sarcomas are rare. In the United States, uterine cancers represent 3.5% of new cancer cases. Types \nThe terms uterine cancer and womb cancer may refer to several different types of cancer that occur in the uterus, namely:\n\nEndometrial cancer \n\n Endometrial carcinomas originate from cells in the glands of the endometrium (uterine lining). These include the common and readily treatable well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, as well as the more aggressive uterine papillary serous carcinoma and uterine clear-cell carcinoma. Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors (also known as uterine carcinosarcomas) are rare endometrial tumors which show both glandular (carcinomatous) and stromal (sarcomatous) differentiation. Uterine sarcomas \n\nLeiomyosarcomas originate from the muscular layer of the uterus (or myometrium). Endometrial stromal sarcomas originate from the connective tissues of the endometrium, and are far less common than endometrial carcinomas. Treatment \nTreatment of uterine cancer may differ depending on the type of cancer and staging of the tumor. For endometrial cancer, five main types of treatments are used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The most common treatment modality for endometrial cancer is surgery, whereby the uterus is removed via a total hysterectomy.
