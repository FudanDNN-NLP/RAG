Bagdasarian sang and recorded the song, varying the tape speeds to produce high-pitched \"chipmunk\" voices, with the vocals credited to Alvin and the Chipmunks, Seville's cartoon virtual band. The album features the Chipmunks and Chipettes singing Disney songs. However, coincidentally, the home entertainment division Buena Vista Home Video (now Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) had released several Chipmunks cartoons on home video in the early 1990s. David \"Dave\" Seville is a fictional character, the producer and manager of the fictional singing group Alvin and the Chipmunks. The character was created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. Bagdasarian had used the name \"David Seville\" as his stage name prior to the creation of the Chipmunks, while writing and recording novelty records in the 1950s. Bagdasarian would later use that technique in \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", which would introduce both Alvin and the Chipmunks as a singing group and\n\nQuestion: Who was the man behind The Chipmunks?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1830, following the death of George IV and when the Duke of Wellington resigned on the question of Parliamentary reform, the Whigs finally returned to power, with Grey as prime minister. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. He remained as prime minister until Gladstone's Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish nationalists at the 1892 general election. The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900. He relinquished the premiership to his nephew Arthur Balfour in 1902 and died in 1903. He was the last prime minister to serve from the House of Lords.

Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, \"like the woman herself ... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling for the fun and goodness of life\". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes. For The Manchester Guardian, Cardus \n\n  Paul Ferrier (29 March 1843 - September 1920) was a French dramatist, who also provided libretti for several composers, especially Varney and Serpette. Ferrier was born in Montpellier. One of Ferrier's biggest successes was the production with Fabrice Carré of Josephine vendue par ses sœurs (1886), an opera bouffée with music by Victor Roger. His opera libretti include La Marocaine (1879), music of Jacques Offenbach; Le Chevalier d'Harmental (1896) after the play of Alexandre Dumas, père, for the music of André Messager; La Fille de Tabarin (1901), with Victorien Sardou, music of Gabriel Pierné. Ferrier died in Nouan-le-Fuzelier (Loir-et-Cher), at age 77.\n\n and though she was eventually better known as a teacher and director, she always considered herself to be a singer, and continued to give solo vocal performances into the 1970s. He soon fell into ill-health, and died at Biarritz, France, on 2 July 1858, aged 35. She appeared at Jullien's promenade concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857, when her ballad singing, the branch of art in which lay her greatest power, was much applauded. She died in the house of a friend, Henry Lee, at Roccles, Upper Sydenham, Kent, on 11 August 1861, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery on 17 August. In 2006, Watts won the Kathleen Ferrier Award.

Her recordings include \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,\" \"We're All Alone\", \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\"\tand the theme song for the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy: \"All Time High\". Natural Act is the third and final duet album by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, released in 1978 on A&M Records. When the couple recorded their first duet album Full Moon in 1973, Kristofferson was the bigger recording star, having won several awards for his songwriting and scoring a massive hit with “Why Me” from his gold selling LP Jesus Was a Capricorn, while Coolidge was still developing as an artist. Although he was now an established film star, Kristofferson’s previous album, Easter Island, was a commercial disappointment. The couple’s marriage was floundering by this time - in the A&E episode of Biography about his life, Kristofferson admits to having a steamy love affair with costar Sarah Miles on the set of 1976's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea - and Natural Act would be their final studio album together. Albums from this era include: Reflections, Payin' Our Dues, Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind (named after their hit cover of The Five Keys song), and Movie Grabbers, which included a rendition of \"You Only Live Twice\", the James Bond motion picture theme. This song was originally recorded by The Imperials – expressly for the film and its soundtrack – but was later given instead to Nancy Sinatra for the film, due to her father Frank's greater influence.\n\nQuestion: Rita Coolidge sang the title song for which Bond film?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On March 21, 1933, Congress enacted the Cullen-Harrison Act, which redefined \"intoxicating beverage\" as one with 3.2 percent alcohol by weight. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, saloons across America were often tied houses, with breweries having exclusive contracts with drinking establishments, including helping business start-ups. Competition was fierce among competing breweries' tied houses within cities. Tied-house restrictions have been construed as forbidding virtually any form of vertical integration in the alcoholic beverage industry. As the Supreme Court of California \n\n Oregon Ballot Mesure 7 (1940) was an initiative proposed for the general election on the November 5, 1940, ballot to repeal the present liquor law, and allow private sales, with regulation and tax. After the repeal of prohibition by the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 5, 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was established to regulate and control the sales and consumption of alcoholic liquor in Oregon. Prior to national Prohibition, beginning in the late 19th century, many states and localities had enacted Prohibition within their jurisdictions. After the repeal of the 18th Amendment, some localities (known as dry counties) continue to ban the sale of alcohol, but often not possession or consumption. Between 1832 and 1953, US federal law prohibited the sale of alcohol to Native Americans. The federal legislation was repealed in 1953, and within a few years, most tribes passed their own prohibition laws. As of 2007, 63% of the federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states had legalized alcohol sales on their reservations.\n\nQuestion: What was the last US state to reintroduce alcohol after prohibition?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Athletes competed in skeleton for the first time, but unlike the previous Olympic Games there was no curling competition and military patrol was a demonstration event rather than a medal event. Both men and women competed in these Games, although women were only allowed to compete in the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs events. This was the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having competed in all editions in the modern era from 1920 onwards, except the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In this edition, Brazil beat both its previous highest number of gold medals obtained at one Olympics until this games (five gold medals in Athens 2004), and its record of total medals won at a Games (17 medals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012). It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). The Men's 110 metres hurdles event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal was held on July 26, 1976, and on July 28, 1976. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. It was the first time in Olympic history that the United States failed to win either gold or silver in the event; the Americans had won the last 9 straight editions of the event and 15 of 17 overall, with silver (and bronze) medals in the other two times (1920 and 1928). This was only the fourth time that the United States failed to win a medal in the men's 200 metres, Wallace Spearmon finishing fourth with a time of 19.90, 0.06 seconds outside of a medal placing (the others being the 1928 Olympics, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow which the country boycotted, and the 2000 Olympics).

Like boxing rings, wrestling rings are also known by the poetic name of the \"squared circle\", which derives from how combative exhibitions would often be held in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. Around the ring are three ring ropes, one fewer than modern boxing rings, which have had four ropes since the 1970s. Some, \n\n The field for the competition was a square measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, which could be constructed by teams for practising prior to competitions. In the centre of the field there is a vertically constructed set of pegs, which are arranged in a three-by-three grid (as a tic-tac-toe board). The ends of the turnbuckles facing into the ring are padded, either individually, or with a large pad for all three similar to a boxing ring, as in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the \"protection area\". The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the \"passivity zone\". This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. Boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\nQuestion: Why is the site of a boxing match called a ring when it's square?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return, while other significant American runners included the winners of the past three Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and 1904 winner Michael Spring. Cuba and South Africa each made their first appearance in the event, while the United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first three Olympic marathons. The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who happened to be in St. Louis as part of the South African exhibit at the 1904 World's Fair. The first marathon was perhaps a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. In April 1944 he finished third in 2:38:31 at Boston to four-time winner Canada's Gérard Côté and two-time champion (and seven-time runner up) John A. Kelley. Nine years later, he ran Boston in 2:43:56. When Sherm Miller, who worked for the St. George City Parks and Recreation Department, returned to St. George after running the Deseret News Marathon in Salt Lake City, he was inspired to host a marathon in St. George. Although others were not as enthusiastic about the idea, he was allowed to hold his marathon. Of the 58 who started the race, only 38 reached the finish line, a finish line on a course that was later \n\n The race was the idea of Tommy Leonard, an avid runner and popular bartender in Boston and Falmouth. After Shorter won the marathon Leonard was quoted as saying \"Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get Frank Shorter to run in a race on Cape Cod?\" One year later, in the summer of 1973, with the help of a local high school track coach John Carroll, and the town's recreation director Rich Sherman, the first Falmouth Road Race was run by approximately 100 people. The next year there were 445 runners, and the year after that Frank Shorter joined 850 other runners in the race, bringing Leonard's wish true.\n\nQuestion: In the very first Boston Marathon, 15 runners competed.

Under Muammar Gaddafi's leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only flag in the world to have one color and no design. During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology.

Harry Richman sang it in the original revue. Although the musical was a flop, \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\" became instantly popular. The song was debuted in the Broadway show Revenge with Music. The show originally opened on November 28, 1934, ran for 22 performances, after which it closed. Authors Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, in their book Song by Song: 14 Great Lyric Writers, say that “...the musical yielded two enduring hits and a profit although it was an artistic failure.”\n\n Show Boat is a 1936 romantic musical film directed by James Whale, based on the 1927 musical of the same name by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in turn was adapted from the 1926 novel of the same name by Edna Ferber. It was originally scheduled to be made in 1934, but plans to make this version with Russ Columbo as the gambler Gaylord Ravenal fell through when Columbo was killed that year in a shotgun accident, and production of the film was rescheduled. The film, with several members of the original Broadway cast, began principal photography in late 1935 and was released in 1936. In addition to the songs retained from the stage production, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three additional songs for the film. The Gershwins wrote ten songs for the musical, eight of which were used in the production, which premiered in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on March 21, 1921.

The \"plot\" originated on 12 April when the British arrested Joseph Dowling after he was put ashore in County Clare by a German U-boat. President Harry S. Truman was shocked when he was informed how small the stockpile really was. By June 1948, components for about fifty Fat Man and two Little Boy bombs were on hand. These were not bombs, but components that had to be assembled by specially trained Armed Forces Special Weapons Project assembly teams known as special weapons units. Fritz Kuhn, the German born leader of the American Nazi movement, was revoked of his United States citizenship by the U.S. District Court in New York City. Kuhn, who had once led the German American Bund, had been incarcerated at the Clinton Prison at Dannemora, New York, after having been convicted of embezzling the Bund's treasury. Its mandate was to get \"information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it\". In 1934, the Special Committee subpoenaed most of the leaders of the fascist movement in the United States. Beginning in November 1934, the committee investigated allegations of a fascist plot to seize the White House, known as the \"Business Plot\". The Bundschuh was to serve as a Europe-wide information network of \"high-grade\" agents that could be used by sabotage and terrorist organizations as they waged a guerrilla war against the Allies. However, the events of the war moved too quickly for the Bundschuh plotters, and Buchardt had to retreat 200 miles to the Austrian-German border.\n\nQuestion: \"Who was the target of the failed \"\"Bomb Plot\"\" of 1944?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The screenplay by Dudley Nichols is an adaptation of \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox. The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in both films as well as Dark Command the following year, Trevor is top-billed over Wayne due to her greater name value at the time. After all, no one knew Stagecoach was going to be a masterpiece, let alone win two Oscars; up until then, no Western had ever been a masterpiece. Gruenberg soon composed an original film score under his sole credit for So Ends Our Night (1941) adapted from famous German exile \n\nStagecoach (1939) ; The Howards of Virginia (1940) ; The Long Voyage Home (1940) ; The Frozen Ghost (1945) ; The Fugitive (1947) ; Fort Apache (1948) ; 3 Godfathers (1948) ; She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) ; Wagon Master (1950). Seven of the scores were for films directed by John Ford; Kathryn Marie Kalinak has written that Ford \"got great work out of the people he worked with, and often those he was hardest on produced the best work of their careers. John Ford's landmark Western film Stagecoach (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made John Wayne a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), My Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), and Red River (1948).\n\nQuestion: Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The band changed tack with the advent of punk in 1977 and Finney and Perrin recruited a new line-up of Pip Nicholls (bass), Adrian Wright (guitar), and Alec Sidebottom (drums, formerly of The Purple Gang), now mixing punk rock with sixties influences. They shared bills with the likes of Buzzcocks, Magazine and Joy Division, and their debut EP, You're Not Going Out Dressed Like That, released in 1979, led to a deal with Factory Records, who released the follow-up, Time Goes By So \n\n \"Speak to Me\" is the first track on British progressive rock band Pink Floyd's 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, on which it forms an overture. Mason states that he created the track himself, whereas Richard Wright and Roger Waters stated the credit was a \"gift\" to Mason to give him some publishing income (subsequently regretted by the latter, following his acrimonious departure from the band). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979).\n\nQuestion: Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story \"The Bubble Bursts.\" The Broadway Musical: A Critical and Musical Survey explained that the song contains a greater number of Jewish \"commonplaces\" than any other number in the score, and added the song does twofold: it \"offers such a strong dose of idiom early in the show [which] is good for the overall unity\", and the \"important dramatic function\" of introducing the central character of Tevye through song. The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase \"if I were a rich man\" to the Cowardly Lion's \"if I were king of the forest\" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine. The musical, with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, was based on the stories of Sholem Aleichem. Before opening on Broadway, the play had been perfected during the summer in performances in Detroit and in Washington, D.C..

There is, however, debate about this among Christians. The disciples (students) then wonder aloud if any person can fully keep Jesus' commandments. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking. The premise of this woodcut is based on a passage from the Bible, John 10:1-42. This passage articulates Christ as the shepherd, his followers as the flock, and all others as thieves. \"All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. an error occurred due to the translator's limitations when the original scrolls were being transferred into Greek.

G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical 1984 novel of the same name. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers. Spielberg was attracted to directing the film because of a personal connection to Lean's films and World War II topics. He considers it to be his most profound work on \"the loss of innocence\". Rising Sun is a 1992 novel by Michael Crichton. Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture. Jones, hunted by natives in revolt, flees through the jungle and slowly disintegrates psychologically. Son of the Stars is a science fiction novel by American writer by Raymond F. Jones, first published in the United States in 1952 by The John C. Winston Company. The typical protagonist in these books was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers. In 2011, Barcelona-based production company Filmax announced that it was producing a film adaptation of the novel. Scott Kosar was set to adapt Ballard's story, and Brad Anderson was to direct. Bale, who played the lead in Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Ballard's Empire of the Sun, apparently is no longer attached to the project.\n\nQuestion: In the 80s who wrote the novel Empire of The Sun?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Oversized commercial vehicles are prohibited from using the bridge, as mandated by the British Columbia Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement agency. Bridge of Four Lions (Львиный мост, Мост о четырех львах) is a 28-metre-long pedestrian bridge over the Griboedov Canal in St Petersburg, connecting L'vinyi Drive to Malaya Podyacheskaya Street. The Lion Bridge is in the Admiralteysky District of St. Petersburg, connecting the Kazansky and Spassky Islands. The structure, suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of lions, was constructed in 1825 according to the design of two well-established bridge builders, Tratter and Kristianovich. It is an outstanding monument of bridge-building architecture of the first quarter of the 19th century [5]. The point, which as its name suggests, is a viewpoint, landmark and tourist attraction in Stanley Park and has a restaurant and other facilities, is just west of the Lions Gate Bridge. The location of the point is known in the Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) language as Chay-thoos, meaning \"high bank\". Two road bridges (the Lions' Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway.

In 2008, former jailed members of Sendero Luminoso and other supporters of the Shining Path established an organisation, MOVADEF, following the aim of Abimael Guzman, the former leader of Shining Path. The Shining Path waged a 13-year-long conflict with both the Peruvian government and rival leftist militants. Osmán Morote Barrionuevo, one of Efraín Morote's sons, became the Shining Path's second-in-command. Efraín Morote's other two children also became members of the Shining Path. Some observers, such as British writer Nicholas Shakespeare (who fictionalized the capture of Abimael Guzmán in his novel The Dancer Upstairs), have argued that Efraín Morote was probably the true intellectual leader of the Shining Path. The government responded with helicopters being called in to respond to the incident to hunt down the perpetrators, at the same time reassuring that elections would still take place, and that nothing had changed regarding them. The ambush marked the deadliest Shining Path attack in years and a resurgence of the group in order to disrupt the Peruvian general elections. According to the deputy minister of interior, migration, and justice, representatives of terrorist organizations from eight countries held another meeting in Santa Cruz in February 1986. In early 1987, Peru's Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) began to concern Bolivian civilian and military authorities after they learned that its strategic plan called \n\n Comrade José (Camarada José, nom de guerre of Víctor Quispe Palomino; born 1 August 1960) is a Peruvian communist militant, leader of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru, a offshoot of the Maoist guerrilla Shining Path.

His actions are noticed by his tribe's totem, who visits him in a dream. In the second half of the poem the narrator has been reincarnated as a present-day poet. In January 1892 H. D. Traill had published an article \"Our Minor Poets\". In March he published a sequel which added Kipling to the list. This stanza was omitted when the poem was published in The Idler. The poet finds his fellows still neglecting their own work to criticize others. Periodontal disease affects more people worldwide than any other illness, according to the Guinness World Records. But a drug developed in Japan regenerates gum and bone, and saves teeth. It is an enormous undertaking for Teresa, and for Tim and Sat, too. In another, a simple exercise helps people overcome the fear of pain and promotes recovery. Fresh or processed, white or red - how does meat measure up? It's been getting a lot of bad press recently with new links to cancer and heart disease. But 98 per cent of us in the UK are still meat eaters. This unique National Geographic docudrama traces the life of a man, Adam, from the Cradle to the Grave, explaining the science behind our highs and lows, the rites of passage we all go through and exploring the inner workings of our bodies and how they change through time. The 90-year-old narrator, Adam, reflects on his life from conception through boyhood, adolescence and beyond, revealing the events that shape him. Along the way we meet the class bully, Adam's first love and the sergeant major preparing him and fellow recruits for Vietnam. One in five families eat convenience foods at least three times a week and a government survey showed only one in six mothers cook from scratch every day. It’s no surprise; they are cheap, convenient and easy. If you were told you could get fit with just a few minutes of exercise a week would you believe it? Over your lifetime you undergo an extraordinary change - no other animal on earth goes through such a dramatic metamorphosis. In recent years, eating has become a health hazard. And we still continue to consume these products in ever greater quantities. So, why do we consume so much processed food and why are we so hooked on it? How exactly does the relentless agribusiness keep us coming back for more? How does it mold our tastes, influence our cravings and feed our addictions?

We will hear from scientists tracking sugar addiction, the businessmen playing on our weaknesses, legal experts preparing to challenge the might of the industry, and simple lovers of good food. As his name suggests, rapper and documentary maker Professor Green has a past relationship with cannabis. As he comes to reflect on his background and wrestle with his own past, Stephen explores addiction and the links between cannabis use and mental health. Gloria and Chris settle the argument over whether tea and coffee are good or bad for us - and if the same is true for both. There is also the truth about a food often touted as a way to fight cancer. In Britain, hundreds are already dying of these infections - mainly the very young or the frail and elderly. The World Health Organisation has described stress as 'the health epidemic of the 21st century'. We meet a man who can taste words and find out how his condition is helping develop new ways to enable blind people to navigate and even recognise colours. And we encounter a man who was immobilised by MS but can now cycle and scuba-dive thanks to a pioneering new treatment that has reversed his disease. Gabriel uncovers the stories of a man with bones as strong as granite, a woman who became pregnant with twins in two separate wombs, a girl whose arm won't stop growing and a woman who gets lost in her own home. We meet a man who injects himself with deadly snake venom, a woman who leads a normal life with only half a brain, a girl who collapses 50 times a day and the only man in the world to be completely cured of HIV. Perhaps even more fascinating is the manner in which the neurosynapses develop, creating the essence of what will become a new personality and intellect. This film explores the amazing mechanics behind the initial milestones in a human infant's life, and even compares them to babies of other species. Is sugar the new tobacco? It all starts with a secret PR campaign dating back to the 1970s. The story of a human life, from first cry to final breath, told from within the body. Throughout life we undergo a continuous second-by-second transformation, every move we make and every outside stimulus triggers a reaction through the skin, bones, organs, muscles and cells. Embark on an incredible journey tracing the story of one everywoman using milestones to examine the everyday workings of a living, functioning body in ways not seen before. Stunning photography reveals universal moments in human development at the most minute level, providing insight into both our own individual metamorphosis and our shared human experiences. A woman narrates her story, portrayed in animated format, of her life with depression and the difficulties that come with it. Growing up in the streets of Dundee, actor Brian Cox was surrounded by tobacco. To find out why not, Brian travels to Virginia in the US to discover how the habit of smoking kick-started the British Empire and created a global market of addicts. We spend an astonishing 2.3 billion pounds on pills, potions and lotions from the chemist's shop every year to beat common ailments from headaches to colds to indigestion. But how much do we really know about what we're buying? Giles Coren, the food critic takes up three extreme diet regimes in a bid to push the very limits of life expectancy. Like many, Michael Mosley wants to get fitter and healthier but can't face hours on the treadmill or trips to the gym. Help may be at hand. He discovers the hidden power of simple activities like walking and fidgeting, and finds out why some of us don't respond to exercise at all. He wants to worry less and become more of an optimist. And he travels to the frontiers of genetics and neuroscience to find out about the forces that shape all our personalities. Speaking to professionals in high-pressure careers - including airline pilots, firemen and Formula One pit workers - he explores the coping mechanisms they each employ when faced with emergency situations, and looks at how these tactics could be transferred to the world of surgery. The programme investigates this claim by conducting a unique experiment with two allergic families in order to find out just what it is in the modern world that is to blame. When pioneering developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith started her training back in the 1960s, she met a group of beautiful, bright-eyed young children who seemed completely detached from the rest of the world. He can do calculations to 100 decimal places in his head, and learn a language in a week. His dream was to get a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the first human lie detector.

He knows he is going to live a happy and contented life. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I travel a lot, and I heard of an outbreak of yellow fever in Uganda. What is this disease, and should I be worried? The total population living in these countries is more than 900 million. All these statistics would be much greater were it not for vaccination. Enough to be vaccinated, and to encourage those who may be at risk to do likewise. The killers came on a Sabbath, brought onto the Seventh-day Adventist church’s compound by the mission president himself and his son, a physician who served as medical director of the church-owned Mugonero Hospital. MUGONERO ADVENTIST HOSPITAL: Some people ran toward the hospital, trying to escape the killing, but were caught by people waiting with machetes. People from all over the country descended on the compound to kill the Adventists. Some of the killers were Adventist. They came with grenades, machetes, knives, anything that could kill a human being. A pastor was preaching when killers entered his church. They first shot and killed him. My wife and children ran to the president’s house for help, but he turned them away. The outbreak of the genocide made it impossible for me to return home. From Kigali I was taken by a group of soldiers to a camp for internally displaced people in a northern province of the country. Even though we were homeless, those who had some money gave tithe and offerings faithfully, as if they were still at home. Sometimes people from Uganda came to visit and gave us money, which we also tithed and used for offerings. So I went throughout the city, pleading with people to return to church. Slowly people returned to the churches. My favorite Bible verse is John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” If God had not loved everyone in the world, I would have gone and killed the killers. When people speak badly about the killers, I remind them that we have a God who is patient with everyone. That’s the only thing that can help someone like me, who has gone through such circumstances. Anytime anyone comes to God and asks for forgiveness, God forgives. The Gospel of Luke focuses on Jesus’ prayer life more than any other book in the Bible. Luke was a Gentile physician who longed to share the eternal truths of salvation with both Jews and Gentiles. Luke wrote his Gospel around A.D. 60 to a growing Christian community. Significantly, it is addressed to someone named Theophilus, which means “lover of God” or “a friend of God.” Luke’s purpose was to lead readers to become God’s friends. The Gospel of Luke presents a revolutionary concept: Jesus, the divine Son of God, dwelt in human flesh and, as a human, developed an intimate relationship with God in prayer. 1. What two significant principles in Jesus’ prayer life do we discover in Luke 5:16 and 9:18? For Jesus, prayer was not a spasmodic practice. He did not pray occasionally, when He “felt” a need. For Jesus, prayer was a way of life. And not only did Jesus pray often—He had regular, planned times to be alone with God (see Luke 11:1 and Mark 1:35). 2. Compare Luke 9:28 with Matthew 18:19, 20. Why do you think praying with others is vital to our prayer experience? Jesus often prayed with and for His disciples. Praying together unites our hearts, encourages our spirits, and lifts our vision. When we hear someone pray for us, we are strengthened by their prayers. When we unite in prayer, seeking God and interceding for others, God moves in unusually powerful ways in response to those prayers. 3. What impact does this incident have on your prayer life? Why would it encourage each one of us? What rich assurance that Jesus, the divine Son of God, knows our names and is praying for us. What encouragement for us to join Jesus and pray for others as He did. 4. What does Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane reveal about the purpose of prayer? Read Luke 22:41-46. It’s not to get from God what we want, but to discover what He wants. 5. In at least two instances in the Gospel of Luke Jesus encouraged His disciples to pray for very specific things. Read Luke 22:39, 40 and 10:2, and describe why these things are so important. Jesus urged His disciples to pray for power over the temptations of the devil, and to pray for laborers to share His love and truth with receptive multitudes. 6 How is Jesus’ prayer on the cross so vital for our own spiritual lives? Read Luke 23:33, 34. Condemned unjustly, treated unfairly, and wrongfully accused, Jesus forgave His tormentors. What a model for us! 7 Read Luke 23:44-46. Jesus had one desire: to please His Father. May our prayer lives be so deep, so complete, that our hearts will be united to Christ’s heart and we will be consumed with the desire to do His will. I had expected the hundreds gathered under the big pavilion roof to be at least quietly pleased at the news of the Seventhday Adventist Church’s largest-ever evangelistic campaign total, but I wasn’t prepared for the scope of their delight. The news was truly “new”—and electrifying—to many, as though they were witnessing the first showers of the promised latter rain. Their joy reminded me that a deep sense of expectation undergirds all Adventist outreach—a hope that this moment, this ingathering, this harvest of souls, might be the one that inaugurates a new Pentecost. And whether the result is 100 or 100,000 (for revival always has a local context), the Spirit clearly intends to restore our confidence and courage as He brings more friends and neighbors to worship and witness with us. As the stories in this journal well illustrate, the Holy Spirit clearly stirred tens of thousands of church members in Rwanda to move assertively into personal mission—each in their own way, each using the gifts uniquely given them. Who dares to say that the sermon preached was more important than the loaf of bread distributed or the house built or the arm placed around a sagging shoulder? Each act— each bit of faithfulness to Jesus—matters greatly to Christ’s kingdom. Sooner or later we will be confronted with all kinds of problems in this world. For a moment the image of what must have been the beautiful perfection of the Garden of Eden comes to mind. What a contrast between the freshness of that perfect creation and the dull winter colors! Desperate, he had decided to end his life. How desperate must a person feel to see suicide as the only way out of their misery! How disastrous when humans discover personally the secret of the knowledge of good and evil! Were Adam and Eve able to imagine the consequences of their sinful choice and what the terrible cost would be? I can only thank God for having protected me from a serious accident. Moreover, I feel a deep gratitude for His care in a world in which death is the major rule of the game. I put a CD into the car stereo, and a song plays whose text exalts Christ as the Lord of life. He offers life to me: to me, a mortal being with a body destined for death; to me, who cannot contribute anything to redeem myself from sin. He wants to reverse the countdown that began the day we were born and put us on the path to life. He who is life, “for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily” (Col. 2:9), has by His death on the cross put us once more within reach of the divine breath that breathed life into mud, which ultimately became Adam. He came to this world of dried-up raisins to invite us to become vines bursting with life. When we accept Christ, we have passed from death to life, because “the world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever” (1 John 2:17, NIV). Clinging to this faith can help us face the worst tragedies without falling apart. While others despair, we have the assurance that God has a plan and that suffering will not last forever. As no marathon runners abandon their race a few meters from the finish line because of blisters on their feet, God’s children go forward in spite of trials. They may have their vision blurred by tears, but they keep their eyes fixed on the goal. It is almost too easy to believe. If we do not grasp this, we may pray for a miracle; and when no miracle comes, we will be discouraged by God’s apparent silence. We may even be tempted to think that God simply doesn’t hear our prayers, or even doubt His existence. And if it sometimes seems that He remains silent it is because He has already given the answer: “She is not dead, but sleeping” (Luke 8:52). It’s vital that we human beings possess this kind of “life insurance,” which guarantees life in the face of death (cf. Christ is the wonderful formula that transforms death into a slumber. This seems too simple. I can neither provide scientific evidence nor explain this medically. “But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope,” writes Paul. “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. . . . For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. 4:13-16). I sense that, today, God helped me to see something important more clearly. And because I believe unshakably in the superabundant sufficiency of God’s power I follow the advice of the apostle Paul when he adds: “Therefore comfort one another with these words” (1 Thess. 4:18). But how could he participate in the Total Member Involvement program, which would culminate in a nationwide evangelistic series in late May? While hundreds of preachers were needed at evangelistic meeting sites across the African country, Nsengiyumva couldn’t take the time off work to prepare and deliver the two weeks of sermons. So Nsengiyumva took stock of what he had: a caring wife, Marianne, and four children; an aging but reliable car; some cash; and fluent English skills obtained during five years of studies in India. “First and foremost, I am an active member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and you know an active member has to tell the truth that he or she knows to others,” said Nsengiyumva, an elder at the Gates of Hope Adventist Church in the resort city of Gisenyi. Nsengiyumva’s three daughters and son—Hope, 12; Friend, 9; Meek, 7; and Merciful, 5—went through their clothes and chose some to give away to those who needed them. Their mother washed and ironed them to make them look like new. “We have to teach them to be cheerful givers,” Nsengiyumva said. In addition, Nsengiyumva signed up to serve as an interpreter for a visiting preacher from the United States, and to drive the speaker to the meeting site, an hour-long roundtrip that followed his regular day of teaching. It is the active involvement of people like Nsengiyumva that paved the way for the largest baptism in the Adventist Church’s history, local church leaders said. Church members studied the Bible with their neighbors and went door-to-door, inviting people to the evangelistic meetings. Rwanda, with a population of 11.8 million people, stands as an example for Adventist believers worldwide, church leaders said. Even the president of the Adventist Church in Zambia, which is located in another church division, flew to Rwanda to view the proceedings firsthand. The previous record for baptisms was 30,000, after a two-week evangelistic series in Zimbabwe in May 2015. Some two dozen came from France. Many funded their own way. Speakers called the event unforgettable and spoke of related blessings in their own lives. A 22-year-old international student studying in the United States told how a Muslim woman and a public university funded her trip. Abner De los Santos, a general vice president of the Adventist world church, described his joy at unexpectedly joining two overwhelmed local pastors in a church baptismal tank to baptize 528 people at a church in Kigali on Sabbath, May 28. De los Santos and his wife, Leticia, a music teacher, preached at two churches in Kigali’s Rusororo district. Adventist Church president Ted N. C. Wilson, who led evangelistic meetings in Gisenyi, thanked local church members for their participation on the last Sabbath. “You are an example for the entire world. Among those present were 1,971 people who had been baptized in nearby Lake Kivu in the morning, and Nsengiyumva, the university teacher who found several ways to participate in Total Member Involvement. Nsengiyumva said he couldn’t be happier. “I praise God that He fulfilled my wishes to participate in the preaching of His message,” he said. “It’s just one thing after another,” his son lamented when I told his family this news. We see this commonly, I told him. Additionally, if there’s one adage in medicine that’s both tragically true and unappreciated by laypeople it’s that interventions (like ventilators) to reverse or manage complications (like brainstem injury) frequently lead to more complications (like aspiration pneumonia). So many difficult questions confronted us, questions we needed to ask not just once but every day: which systems were improving? Which were worsening? Which could improve and which couldn’t? The answers changed every day as the enormous volume of data we collected on every aspect of his body’s function changed. Given enough time, all demented patients will become non-verbal and stop eating. At what point, then, do we withhold antibiotics for pneumonia, for example? Or insert a feeding tube (via the skin overlying the stomach) to augment declining nutrition? For a doctor lacking a personal connection to the human being their severely demented patient once was, these choices are difficult at best. For family members who retain a vivid picture of their loved one in full possession of all their faculties, they’re agonizing. We try to balance a reaction to today’s data and the interventions they suggest we make with the broader picture and the likely long-term outcome. Keeping a sharp eye on both, knowing which to believe more on any given day, is extremely challenging. But this is where the art of medicine lives and wisdom and compassion are most vitally required. In the end, my patient survived. Afterward, he required twenty-four hour care. But it wasn’t clear to me at that point if he would have even understood the question. I think I know his answer. Who would want to live like that? Not me and not anyone I have asked. Quality of life is much more important than quantity. And I believe God was telling this man it was his time to die. You have raised an interesting question, but there is one issue you haven’t addressed: money. Why even begin? Yes, I am saying that at least partly, it’s a matter of money. (The NEJM agrees.) But the outcome—death—is the same. I don’t remember the author of this quote, but I think he had a point. We also need to help them understand that in some instances and at a certain point, interventions are futile. Society may pay the financial costs, but the patients pay dearly in suffering, confusion and lost quality of life. And especially, physicians need to convey that in the case of a demented patient, no intervention can ever bring back the person their loved one once was. So, how did the son/family feel about the outcome? Or did family members assume his care? Maybe now, as he lives, he doesn’t have an inclination of his total debility and need for total care? She was crying, telling me for the first time her husband didn’t recognize her when she visited him, and she didn’t know how much longer she could afford to pay for his care, at over $4,000/month. I believe as our bodies last longer and longer, way past the time our brains are functioning, the questions and the decisions will get harder and harder. The cost is extremely high, both financially and emotionally. If we have never looked closely at end-of-life issues; if we have thought that those issues are only for medical people to think about/meditate upon; if we have never looked at a frail elderly person or a person with dementia and tried to imagine ourselves in his/her position; if we have never developed the habit of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes; if we have never learned to identify with another, not matter what their age or stage . . . Never having considered death, our own or that of someone close to us . . . is blindness. Alex prompts us, with posts such as this, to consider our mortality and that of others. Never mind the anxiety that this consideration may bring. Guts is what we need in order to keep ourselves from being blind and fearful! Alex, thank you for an insightful essay. The difficulty, as you discuss, is in deciding when enough is enough. We do the best we can with the information we have on hand, and sometimes people surprise us by full recovery when things have looked extremely bleak, and other times the outcome, sadly, is as you describe. And yet in that case, we are allowed to use our medical judgment and gently say no, it will not help. My dad, a fit and fine 86 year old, went on a walk, fell down and suffered a femur fracture. And then as you say one cog leading to another: 13 bottles of blood, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, mesenteric angiography to try find out what on earth was the matter, finally a high risk colonoscopy, yes, on the ventilator, arrhythmia, lung infection that was on and off, and then very bad, and finally renal failure. And other than the last one day, he was conscious, he knew, he knew he was going. In India, the patient pays, or God bless. From a purely medical standpoint you have the unenviable task of playing God. What I appreciate about this entry is how it clarified the issue. It provides me a valuable reminder of the need to practice compassion when these situations arise; to extend it to all the people involved, and also to myself. The dementia had seen to that. My husband swears that she recovered as quickly as she did because she had no idea what was wrong and what was happening—she never worried about a thing. It is so unfair. It seems like relief from suffering is what people are hoping for (at least, suffering without a positive goal or purpose). But how much are the demented suffering? I often wondered how it seemed from her side. The relief from suffering of those around the patient seems to be a real puzzle, however. I would guess that the son feared this outcome, which is why he asked the question. (We were told this might have been because it was a Catholic hospital.) A well-meaning pulmonary technician actually said to me that I shouldn’t worry because he could live for years like this! Your explanation of dementia—always fatal, loss of appetite and memory—was very helpful. Her response, “Yes.” My oldest sister was 75, but most of my relatives lived until their late 80s or early 90s with very sharp minds. We should consider this more often in making all our decisions. There is TIME to think and accept in those situations. Am I wrong in thinking that until the body recovered, the state of the man’s mental condition was not known? I am not a newcomer to caring for people with dementia. Yet… he (not my husband, but another relative) has today told jokes, laughed at mine, and expressed a desire to die. The point I want to make is that these kind of decisions cannot be addressed morally with policies or rules written by bureaucrats—each case is different. The story itself is repeating from time to time and people getting caught and diagnosed too many times too late.\n\nQuestion: \"According to Rudyard Kipling what were the \"\"two imposters\"\" to meet and treat the same day?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\" Its name was coined by the English cartoonist and author Osbert Lancaster, as Curzon Street in Mayfair was an address popular with London high society. Giovannetti started to work as a draughtsman producing materials for the British satirical magazine Punch. There he published different comic book characters’ stories. The British humorous magazine Punch (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's Comic Almanac (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier.

During Labor Day weekend 1961, they, their cousin Mike Love, and a friend Al Jardine, gathered here to record a tape of their breakthrough song “Surfin’.” This marked the birth of the rock group known worldwide as the Beach Boys, and the beginning of a historic musical legacy. The lineup of the Beach Boys at that time was Brian, Carl, and Dennis; their cousin Mike Love; and David Marks (who grew up in a house across the street from the Wilson home.) Al Jardine, the group's original bassist, would later rejoin the band soon before David's departure.

McMahon told Barry Divola from Stars of Oz that Ben is characterised as a \"lovely guy, he's very honest, very open.\" In the 1992 Home and Away Annual, Kesta Desmond and David Nicholls described Ben as being \"relaxed\" and \"easy-going\" for a twenty-one-year-old male. Ben's lifelong friend was Dave Porter (John Adam) and he helped Ben through school as he suffered racist taunts because of his ethnicity. Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as creating a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show \"Ben\", which is hosted by a bear named \"Gentle Ben\" wearing a microphone on its head, reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. Dennis Franz was the writers' second choice for the actor who plays Homer in the television dramatisation.

Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. The goal was achieved with Apollo 11, which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited the Moon in Command Module Columbia. During the Apollo 11 mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969. On 20th July 1969, the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, Eagle, landed on the Moon's surface with two astronauts aboard. There were four Apollo missions in total in 1969, three of which traveled to the Moon, with Apollo 12 also landing on the surface. In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy challenged his nation to land an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth. NASA achieved its goal with Apollo 11, which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

In 1967, producer Bones Howe had asked Webb to create a pop song with different movements and changing time signatures. Webb delivered \"MacArthur Park\" to Howe with \"everything he wanted\", but Howe did not care for the ambitious arrangement and unorthodox lyrics and the song was rejected by the group the Association, for whom it had been intended. Three of the songs on the album are written or co-written by Harold Gay, one of the members. The album is best remembered for its version of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park,\" which rose to #23 on the Billboard country charts and won a Grammy for Best \n\n MacColl ended up doing her own version at the request of her label as part of an intended album of \"teen ballads\". Speaking of the song's titular character, MacColl told Smash Hits in 1983: \"Terry seems to be a really good name for a lovable rogue. The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop music composer Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach's frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit went to Minnelli's ex-husband, Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager: the line \"When you get caught between the moon and New York City\" from the chorus was taken from an unreleased song Allen and Bayer Sager had previously written together. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, A Tramp Shining, included the seven-minute hit song \"MacArthur Park\" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as \"MacArthur's Park\"). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the 1973 TV special \"Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La\", after singing Webb's \"Didn't We\", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the song MacArthur Park?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Recorded in New York City, \"Colour My World\" was rush released in December 1966 in an attempt to counteract the disappointing performance of Clark's preceding single \"Who Am I?\" which had fallen short of the US Top 20 and more seriously had become the first Petula Clark single since \"Downtown\" (1964) to not rank in the UK Top 50. \"Chalk up another chart topper in this intriguing Hatch-Trent rhythm number featuring the popular Indian sitar sound and exceptional Clark vocal work.\" The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and the Breakaways vocal group. Beginning with her American breakout, \"Downtown,\" Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: \"Who Am I?\" It was recorded in 1965 by Petula Clark at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured drummer Bobby Graham and the Breakaways vocal group. Released as the follow-up to \"Downtown\", which it strongly resembles both in musical structure and the story conveyed by the lyrics, \"I Know a Place\" became Clark's second consecutive Top Ten hit in the United States, remaining on the charts for twelve weeks. Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on \"Downtown\", her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. Clark's next UK single \"You're the One\" would boost her UK chart profile considerably with a #23 peak but it would be the subsequent \"My Love\" - ironically a record the singer disliked - which would consolidate the stardom augured for Clark by \"Downtown\".

Live recordings by Hendrix are found on several albums; more recently, the Monterey version is included on Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001) and Live at Monterey (2007). It was used as the closing number at a Saville Theatre show in London on June 4, 1967. Hendrix \"ended the gig by smashing a guitar handed to him for the finale ... and hurling it into the audience\". The show was dubbed a \"farewell\" concert by Shapiro and Glebbeek, before the band headed to the US and their appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. A performance recorded at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, on October 10, 1968, was released on the 1982 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts album. All that remains of that historic night are seconds of a video of Jimi plugging into his amps, pictures taken by few professional photographers, and a horrible distorted audio recording that's barely audible. By most eyewitness accounts, the Harlem crowd was slow to warm up to Jimi, with someone even throwing an object on stage. In 1966, during his residency as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha? in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became \"Red House\". In an effort to out-do the Who's destruction of their instruments earlier at the same event, Hendrix poured lighter fluid over his guitar and set it on fire, even though \"I'd just finished painting it that day\" as he would later remark. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine included this in their list of \"50 Moments That Changed Rock & Roll\" alongside Townshend's first guitar smashing in 1964.\n\nQuestion: Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By 1896, Isabella and Jack Gardner recognized that their house on Beacon Street in Boston's Back Bay, although enlarged once, was not sufficient to house their growing collection of art, including works by Botticelli, Vermeer, and Rembrandt.

She purchased land for the museum in the marshy Fenway area of Boston, and hired architect Willard T. Sears to build a museum modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice.

However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths that have yet to have occurred due to the disaster's long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 cases in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. This no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Note also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. Differing direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. For their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia. 2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\". However—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context. Others have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident. Liquidator mortality \n\nThe uncertain and contested mortality rate of the Chernobyl liquidators is a major factor in the lack of consensus on the Chernobyl disaster's accurate death toll. Following the disaster itself, the Soviet Union organized an effort to stabilize and seal off the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of an estimated 600,000 \"liquidators\" recruited or conscripted from all over the Soviet Union. The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low. For their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health. Addressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated based upon his team's research. In 2020, Hauptmann and many international scientists studying the numerous damages resulting from the \"low doses\" that have afflicted the populations of survivors of the explosions of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and also in numerous accidents of nuclear plants that have occurred in the world, concluded in an extensive meta-analysis that the new epidemiological studies directly support excess cancer risks from low-dose ionizing radiation; and Venturi has reported in Russian journal \"Biosfera\" a correlation between radioactive caesium and world increase of incidence and death for pancreatic cancer. By 2016, some Ukrainian and Belarussian physicians charged with treating large numbers of former liquidators in the decades since the accident were calling for more comprehensive studies and urging that the IAEA's estimated toll of disaster-related deaths from long-latency diseases be revised upwards, claiming that their own data indicates a former liquidator death rate of several thousand per year as a result of diseases related to the disaster. Greenpeace have projected up to a million excess, cancer-related deaths from the Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl Forum, the WHO, and other international agencies do not accept this number. Methodological debates \nThe use of differing, contested methods to identify and tally deaths—including anticipated deaths due to long-latency diseases—has also contributed to the wide range of estimates of the Chernobyl disaster's death toll. Indeed, at the August 1986 meeting of the first international conference on the disaster, the IAEA scaled down from 40,000 to 4,000 the projected disaster-related deaths estimate of Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official commission—after objecting to Legasov's use of a statistical model based on radiation data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Similarly, some theoretical estimates of the disaster's deaths are disputed on the grounds that they rely upon contested models such as the linear no-threshold model (LNT) or hormesis in order to compare the disaster's estimated cancer rates to background rates of cancer. Yet even estimated death tolls that have acknowledged and attempted to mitigate for such methodological debates have yielded a body of divergent estimates—including the Union of Concerned Scientists' 2011, LNT-model-based conclusion of 27,000 deaths due to the accident; the death toll of 93,000 to 200,000 that Greenpeace has posited since 2006; and Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment (published in 2007 by Russian affiliates of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, but without NYAS' explicit approval), which estimates 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity the accident released. Surviving evacuees' accounts \nSince 1986, officials have tended to discount as inaccurate, inexpert opinion the claims of some surviving Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve evacuees that their own observations of deaths attributable to the disaster are not reflected in official records and tallies. For example, authorities have long dismissed as 'urban legend' some Pripyat evacuees' claims of high death rates among fellow citizens who gathered on a railway bridge—the so-called 'Bridge of Death'—to watch the exploded reactor's blazing fire and glowing, electric blue column of ionized air in the midst of visible nuclear fallout on the night of the accident. Indeed, some authorities have argued that post-disaster psychological trauma—sometimes characterized as Radiophobia or labeled a mental aspect of the collection of post-accident symptoms that some physicians term 'Chernobyl Syndrome'—has led some former residents of the region surrounding the plant to attribute deaths to the accident based on anecdotal evidence alone. In this vein, the Chernobyl Forum, the World Nuclear Association (WNA), and other groups posit an increase in psychological problems among those exposed to the disaster's radiation, due in part to poor communication of radiation's effects, disruption to their way of life, and trauma surrounding the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response, some former residents of the region that now comprises the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve—including Lyubov Sirota, a Ukrainian poet and Pripyat evacuee, in her 1995, Chernobyl Poems verse, \"Radiophobia\", and her 2013 memoir, The Pripyat Syndrome—decry such questioning of survivors' psychology and discernment as efforts to dismiss and de-legitimize both evacuees' claimed long-term experience of the disaster's lethal impacts and evacuees' allegations of the accident's tangible, ongoing effects upon their physical health. She wrote:\n\nStill more controversially, some surviving Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve evacuees take particular issue with the longstanding position of constituent United Nations agencies to discount as misinformation, \"urban legend\", or radiophobia the claims of some evacuees that during the weeks and months directly after the accident, they witnessed more immediate disaster-related deaths due to trauma and radiation sickness that they argue are not reflected in the official record.

See also \n Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment\n Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\nAftermath of the Chernobyl disaster\nDeath in Ukraine\nChernobyl disaster\n\n  The worst nuclear accident to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\". Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. WHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. The wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high. According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n Evidence can be seen from the 1986 Chernobyl event. Due to the violent nature of accident in Chernobyl, a sizable portion of radioactive contamination resulted from the atmosphere were particles that where dispersed during the explosion. Many of these contaminates settled in groundwater systems in immediate surrounding areas, but also Russia and Belarus. Radionuclides carried by groundwater systems in and around the areas of Chernobyl have resulted in the uptake to plants in the region and up the food chains into animals, and eventually, humans – as one of the largest \n\nThe Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine.

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. Both the cultural and the political thaws were effectively ended with the removal of Khrushchev as Soviet leader in October 1964, and the installment of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1964. When Khrushchev was dismissed, Alexei Kosygin took over Khrushchev's position as Soviet Premier, but Kosygin's economic reform was not successful and hardline communists led by Brezhnev blocked any motions for reforms after Kosygin's failed attempt. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was the leader. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko \n\n and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov.\n\nQuestion: Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative. The moment a baby is placed in the \"baby bin\" care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. Baby M was the first baby that came through the \"baby bin\", arriving \n\n\"Hu (Boulter) Armach, Primate of All-Ireland, being in the chair, ordered that a turning-wheel, or convenience for taking in children, be provided near the gate of the workhouse; that at any time, by day or by night, a child may be layd in it, to be taken in by the officers of the said house.\" Baby hatches have existed in one form or another for centuries. In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century, but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches, Czech Republic (76), Poland (67), and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006. The hatch is known in German-speaking countries as a Babyklappe (baby hatch or flap), Babyfenster (baby window) or Babywiege (baby cradle); in Italian as Culla per la vita\n\nQuestion: In the late 60s Owen Finlay MacLaren pioneered what useful item for parents of small chldren?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-Communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. This was soon followed by the dismantling \n\n In 1980, Andrzej Wieckowski assumed a leadership role in Solidarity at the University of Warsaw, a Polish non-governmental trade union, which over time evolved to become non-violent anti-communist social movement, generally viewed today as having greatly contributed to the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989–1990. The organisation grew from this protest, and demanded Objective One regional funding for Cornwall, an exclusively-Cornish European Parliament constituency, a Cornish university, support for Cornwall's traditional industries and local control over Cornwall's health service; these demands were broadly similar to those being made at the time by Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party that had recently relaunched itself. On July 8, 1980 a strike started in the WSK factory, which quickly spread to other factories in the Lublin region and brought the local economy to a standstill. However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland's Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers seized arsenals, took control of the shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the rights of freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion, as well as the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Walentynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.\n\nQuestion: In which city's shipyard was Solidarity set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film also included extended family members created specifically for this production, such as Gomez's brother Pancho (played by Henry Darrow) and two additional children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr. The latter two were portrayed as near copies of the original children, now known as Wednesday Sr. and Pugsley Sr., who were once again played respectively by Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax, the original Wednesday and Pugsley in the \n\n The Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\" (a.k.a.

Gaidamachuk killed her final victim, Alexandra Povaritsyna, whose neighbor had seen her leave around the time of the murder. After the police received the information from Povaritsyna's neighbor, they arrested Gaidamachuk who quickly confessed to the killings. Another woman who had been initially suspected for the crimes, and after pressure from authorities, had already confessed to the murders. Gaidamachuk stated that she committed the murder-robberies to pay for vodka to feed her \n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. They mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. In February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered. In a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless. In 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role. Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. In the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.

The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. They mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. In February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered. In a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless. In 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role. Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. In the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.

Two years after the Atlanta Games, FINA banned Smith for four years for tampering with her urine sample using alcohol; the testers also found traces of a metabolic precursor of testosterone, Androstenedione. Smith was not stripped of her medals, as the test upon which the ban was based was conducted well after the Games. In May 2014, Sun was banned for three months by the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) after he tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug that was banned four months earlier and classified as a stimulant at the time by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The substance was at the time prohibited in competition only; the ingestion of trimetazidine by an athlete out of competition \"is inconsequential\" and constitutes illicit behaviour only if the athlete later participates in competition before the substance clears their system. WADA requested for a ban of between two and eight years according to a later media release from CAS. According to Sun's coach Dennis Cotterell, the drug test conducted on the 4 September 2018, was the swimmer's ninth drug test in two weeks. Sun Yang \n\n De Bruin married Irish swimmer Michelle Smith in 1996.

He is the first player to win 14 grand slam men's singles titles, since surpassed by Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic. The career of American former tennis player Pete Sampras started when he turned professional in 1988 and lasted until his official retirement in August 2003. During his career Sampras played in 266 official tournaments and won 64 singles titles, including 14 titles at Grand Slam events. Sampras reached the No. In April 1993, Sampras attained the No. 1 and fellow American Jim Courier in the final. In the 2000s, they met three more times on the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests. In 2000, the top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the Australian Open in five sets, which was an important win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous 5 matches against Sampras.

She also won a bronze medal in 30 km classical as well as a silver medal in the relay. In 1998, she won Tjejvasan. Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross-country skiing; her teammates Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen won silver and bronze respectively. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men's race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold. Hallgeir Brenden won the 18-kilometer race and helped Norway take the silver in the 4 × 10-kilometer relay. In 1956 he also served as the flag bearer for Finland at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics and won the jumping event at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. The existing world record for two handed javelin throw by Eric Lemming was 91.28 metres, but with their enhancement, Jarl broke it with 91.41 metres. It was then improved by Evert to 98.47, followed by Lemming imitating their grip and taking back the record with 104.40 metres.

Moss took his seventh Grand Prix victory by 2.7 seconds over Italian driver Luigi Musso (Ferrari 246 F1). Musso's British teammate Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari 246 F1) was third. This race was won by Nino Farina in a Ferrari, just over 1 minute ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio. Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari clinched his second consecutive World Drivers' Championship as neither Mike Hawthorn nor Juan Manuel Fangio won the race and now couldn't beat his points total with two races left. Initially Mike Hawthorn was assigned to drive the Ferrari 412 MI #12 for the 1958 edition of the Race of Two Worlds. But when he felt unwell, his teammate Luigi Musso had to run the race.

She wrote the book as an apologia to defend her husband from perceived attacks, and to preserve his legacy. Critics generally considered the book to be \"delightful\" as a \"collection of episodes\", but especially those writing at publication predicted it would be of little historical value except for its account of Woodrow Wilson's stroke and last days in office. However it has been used by academic historians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to examine a variety of topics related to Edith Wilson.

Although Hawaii is further away from equator than Fiji, and therefore there is a slightly greater variation in the daylight length, Hawaii does not observe DST. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, and Oahu, Kauai and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. Therefore advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June. Hawaii did experiment with DST for three weeks between April 30, 1933 and May 21, 1933; there are no known official records as to why it was implemented or discontinued. Hawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the Uniform Time Act, having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967. Mexico uses DST (or \"Summer Schedule\") widely, with clocks in most of the country changing on the first Sunday of April and the last Sunday of October. Some areas (including the state of Baja California) change on the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in November, matching the schedule in most of the U.S.A.. Some others, including Quintana Roo and Sonora, do not observe DST. The territory of Nunavut comprises three time zones: Mountain Time in the west, Central Time in the centre and Eastern Time in the east. Daylight saving time is observed throughout Nunavut with the exception of Southampton Island, including Coral Harbour, and Eureka—a permanent research station on Ellesmere Island—both of which remain on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. On February 19, 2007, Nunavut added parts of March and November to its daylight saving period, following the United States' Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n\nQuestion: If it is 3 a.m. in Nevada, what time is it in Montana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It then moves east under the Suez Canal in four tunnels. It continues on the other side of the Suez Canal as the El-Sheikh Jaber canal. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km wide. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa. Without recourse to a port on the Red Sea Israel would have been unable to develop its diplomatic, cultural and trade ties \n\n  The Suez Canal, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the sea journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and\n\nQuestion: The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea to which other Sea?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors. There were attempts to incorporate democracy, republicanism, and industrialism into Chinese philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-sen at the beginning of the 20th century In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President. While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming, refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan Shikai. Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.

Largely denied access to personal relationships with men of their own rank, several of the daughters of George III embarked on such romances with gentlemen at court. As she wrote to her brother, the future King George IV, then Prince Regent, in 1812, the two had entered into an understanding around 1803, while Spencer was stationed in England. The couple conducted their romance with the utmost privacy, and Augusta asked the Prince Regent in 1812 to consent to her marrying Spencer, promising further discretion in their behaviour. It was Spencer who informed Augusta of her mother's death later that year, and Spencer was said to be holding a locket with Augusta's picture when he died in 1828.\n\n the Baronetage of England. Spencer strongly disapproved of the match, but Compton's influence at court enabled him to procure Spencer's imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in March 1599 for ill-treating his daughter. The marriage quickly followed, but Spencer gave his daughter no marriage portion. But some reconciliation apparently took place soon afterwards, it is said, through the intervention of Elizabeth. Georgiana Spencer (1757–1806), daughter of the 1st Earl Spencer, married William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire ; Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Sunderland, married in 1731 John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford ; Diana, Princess of Wales (born Lady Diana Spencer), daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, married in 1981 Charles, Prince of Wales, and had issue. ; Clarissa Spencer-Churchill, daughter of Jack Spencer-Churchill (younger brother of Sir Winston Churchill), married Sir Anthony Eden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. ; Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, married Clementine\n\nQuestion: In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Fayed was a student at Collège Saint Marc before attending the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. Fayed was the first cousin of the late Washington Post Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. Fayed also worked for his father on Harrods' marketing. In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities. Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz's Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed's offer of a formal partnership. Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company \n\n He earned a degree in philosophy from Cairo University in Khartoum before moving from Sudan to the United States in the 1980s. Later that year, the London-based Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods at that time, signed a fifty-year lease on the villa. Al-Fayed extensively refurbished and restored what he termed the Villa Windsor, and for his efforts was promoted to an Officier in the Légion d'honneur in 1989. Al-Fayed's son Dodi visited the villa with Diana, Princess of Wales, for half an hour on the day before their deaths in 1997. Mohammed Mahdi Al Tajir was born in December 1931 in Bahrain, and educated at Preston Grammar School in Lancashire. Al Tajir also owns London's Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million. In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam.\n\nQuestion: In which North African country was Mohammed Al-Fayed, owner of Harrods department store in London, born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film. Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, Griffith founded United Artists, enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. The new company was to be made with finance from Art Cinema, a subsidiary company of United Artists, in a deal brokered by Joseph Schenck. However, when Schenck presented the deal to Art Cinema's board, it was turned down. An embarrassed Schenck decided personally put up half the cost of the three films, with the other half met by Small and Goetz. Others active in the 1930s included Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Ogden Nash, Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Maurice Rapf. The film studios responded by refusing to hire Guild members and forming \n\n Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Rowland was the head of Metro Pictures Corporation from 1915 to 1920, a studio he founded in 1915 along with Louis B.

Fairbanks was a founding member of United Artists. He was also a founding member of The Motion Picture Academy and hosted the 1st Academy Awards in 1929. With his marriage to actress and film producer Mary Pickford in 1920, the couple became 'Hollywood royalty', and Fairbanks was referred to as \"The King of Hollywood\", a nickname later passed on to actor Clark Gable.\n\nQuestion: Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Théâtre des Noctambules was a former Parisian cabaret established in 1894 by the chansonnier Martial Boyer (1872–1941) and located at 7 rue Champollion in the 5th arrondissement of Paris (Latin Quarter). Fernand Voiturin became manager in 1952 until the venue closed down in June 1956, when the theatre was turned into a Revival house (Art et Essai) under the same name. Dugravier lives with his daughter Reine, his niece Louise and his servants Julie and Bertrand. The latter is in love with Julie but she favours Jasmin, a valet in a nearby house, visiting the Dugravier home. With Dugravier gone, Louise confides to Julie that she has a lover, Charles, with whom she has an assignation that night, while Reine confesses that she too is to meet her own César. The three young men then escape through a window, but return shortly after, claiming to have fought off the imaginary bandits.

In the song, the main character, Tevye, explains the roles of each social class (fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters) in the village of Anatevka, and how the traditional roles of people like the matchmaker, the beggar, and the rabbi contribute to the village. The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. and Broom-maker, the Fiddler explains why they are there: the city fathers, proud of their wealth and affluence, want the wise woman to identify a king to lead them. Happy with this prophecy, the Broom-maker and Woodcutter return to town. The Fiddler, however, has glimpsed the Goose-Girl through the window, and stays behind. They have come to fetch the Fiddler back to town. He swore he would never return there, but the Broom-maker says they need him: everything has gone to pieces in town; the children do not trust the adults, and there is conspiracy and mutiny everywhere. The Innkeeper's little Daughter shoves them away and addresses the Fiddler directly: the children, she says, know he was right and their parents were wrong; the King's Son and the Goose-Girl belong on the throne.

Michener's 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific. The screenplay, adapted by Joshua Logan (who directed the previous 1958 film version) and Lawrence D. Cohen, tells the story of a war-torn romance between a young American nurse (Close) and an older French plantation owner (Sherbedgia). It was first introduced by Mary Martin in the original Broadway production and sung by Mitzi Gaynor in the 1958 film adaptation. In the show, Nellie sings this song after being convinced that despite the racial differences between her and Emile, there is good in him. They introduced it to Mary Martin one night when they were at Joshua Logan's house fine-tuning the script. Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for South Pacific, knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for the lead in the film version of South Pacific and she reportedly wanted the part. They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband Martin Melcher would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to Mitzi Gaynor.

It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Europe is a landmass variously recognised as part of Eurasia or a continent in its own right, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east.

In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. Following the delays in the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the Danish opt-outs, the treaty came into force on 1 November 1993 under the third Delors Commission. The new European Union introduced the pillar system, formalising European Political Cooperation as the Common Foreign and Security Policy and adding the new area of Justice and Home Affairs. Furthermore, on 25 May, the European Investment Fund was established by the EIB and the European Police Office was created on 26 July 1995 with the signing of the Europol convention. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,: Following the end of the Cold War, the European Economic Community pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries.

Beovoz was the suburban/commuter railway network that provided mass-transit services in the city, similar to Paris's RER and Toronto's GO Transit. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways. Belgrade is one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro or subway or other rapid transit system. It ran for a distance of 8 km from the port of Piraeus to Thissio in center of Athens. From 1911 it was also possible to run through freight trains on the Piraeus Harbour Tramway using dual system electric locomotives.

It is introduced to the protagonists Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the antagonist 'Prock' (the Whangdoodle's second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity.

Parton also covers the Jeannie C. Riley hit \"Harper Valley PTA\", Tammy Wynette's \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\", and Porter Wagoner's hit, \"The Carroll County Accident\". The series went on to flesh out the story in the song, as it told of the adventures of Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden), a widowed single mother to teenager Dee (Jenn Thompson), who lived in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio. The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr (George Gobel). Her most notable foes were the wealthy and completely snobbish Reilly family, which consisted of the snobby head of the family, Flora (Anne Francine); her snotty daughter, Wanda (Bridget Hanley); her husband, Bobby, (Rod McCary) and their daughter, \n\n Riley, who was working as a secretary in Nashville for Jerry Chesnut, got to hear the song and recorded it herself and it became a massive hit for her.

Surrounding this is an annular set of designs depicting flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Sub-Antarctic Islands\". Dr Law saw potential in the leopard seal as a simplified ANARE symbol.

At the same time the term ANARE fell out of official use the 'globe' logo was also discarded in favour of the Australian coat of arms to bring the livery of the AAD in line with the rest of the Australian Public Service. However like the ANARE name the logo continues to be used on an informal basis by expeditioners each year in the production of Antarctic Station badges, T-shirts and other memorabilia.\n\nQuestion: What color golf balls are used on the golf course in Antarctica?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The album was recorded from mid-1980 to early 1981 with Collins and Hugh Padgham as producers. Face Value was an instant commercial \n\n Collins was recording his solo album, the record industry was suffering greatly from the impact of the worldwide economic recession, and many labels were beginning to cull their rosters and drop acts that weren't providing major returns. At this same time, Genesis' contract with Atlantic was up for renewal, and Collins was yet to sign as a solo artist. As part of the negotiations, Collins and his bandmates wanted their own 'vanity' label, Duke Records, but according to Kalodner, and despite Ertegun's personal interest, the group's demands, and their relatively modest performance in the US made Atlantic executives ambivalent about \n\n Phil Collins had three UK number-one singles in the 80s, seven US number-one singles, another with Genesis, and when his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more top 40 hits on the  Billboard Hot 100 chart during the 1980s than any other artist. The album was Collins' first to not contain any American Top 40 hits, with the title track only \n\n Philip David Charles Collins (born 30 January 1951) is an English drummer, singer, record producer, songwriter, and actor. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins achieved three UK and seven US number-one singles in his solo career.

The record features two covers: \"Connection\" by the Rolling Stones, and Chuck Berry's classic \"Let it Rock.\" Although it seemed like a good fit with the record company's blues roster, Chess was more interested in the song that became \"Maybellene\", the song that launched Berry's career as a rock and roll star. Berry often performed the song live. It is included on the 1969 album Chuck Berry Live in Concert, and in the 1987 film Hail!

The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. Her divorce had not been made final, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.

Throughout the career of African-American singer Michael Jackson, there was intense speculation and criticism about his physical appearance, physical and mental health, and sexuality. He first became famous as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. Jackson said he had been physically abused by his father and had not had a childhood. As an adult Jackson's appearance began to change, as his nose became thinner and his skin lightened. Media reports and criticism stated that he wanted to look more white and had extensive cosmetic surgery that resulted in a public discussion about his mental health. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. To treat the condition, he used makeup to even out his skin. When the condition got worse Jackson used prescription creams to depigment his skin. Over years a lot of different rumors about Jackson's sexuality and the paternity of his children circulated. In 2005 he was acquitted on child sexual abuse. Jackson also suffered from dehydration and insomnia. In 1993 Jackson revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was suffering from vitiligo. Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. Jackson was criticized for hiding it by bleaching, and some even cast doubt on whether he suffered from vitiligo. In late 1993 Jackson's skin disorder became relevant for the investigations into sexual child abuse accusations against him. A search warrant was served on Jackson allowing authorities to examine and photograph any part of the singer's body including his private parts. Shortly after Jackson's death, FDA-approved creams to treat vitiligo (Benoquin and hydroquinone) had been found in Jackson's residence. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid drawing attention to his skin. World Vitiligo Day is held on Jackson's passing day. Jackson contradicted those reports in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk saying he only had had two rhinoplasties. Jackson had told Patrick Treacy that he been suffering from a facial hypersensitivity caused by a botched cosmetic surgery. Jackson's second wife Debbie Rowe, who had met Jackson while she had been working for Klein, said she had been designated to help him through procedures. Jackson however, said that he had a dimple created in his chin attributing the other changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. He also denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. Jackson said he had a tough time when he reached puberty. People hadn't recognized expecting 'cute Michael' they used to know, and Jackson said they had seemed to be surprised that he was undergoing natural changes during puberty. In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson was asked about his cheeks; he answered: \"These cheekbones? Jackson consumed a lot of water, preventing dehydration and voice problems. Jackson appeared in court wearing a T-shirt, a blazer, pajama bottoms and slippers. On March 21, Jackson arrived in court accompanied by a doctor. It is believed that he suffered from back problems again. During the trial, Jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat. Jackson's spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, said \"stress contributed to the back problem.\" In September 1992, a concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany was canceled because Jackson was ill with the flu. His private doctor attended to Jackson in Istanbul. According to organizers, Jackson's \"vocal cords were irritated.\" Jackson was seen by a throat specialist in London and was advised to seek further treatment in Los Angeles. People around Jackson took precautions to keep him healthy. One of the measures was that Jackson wore a surgical mask during air travel. One week later, the jury selection for the child molestation trial resumed in Jackson's presence. Insomnia\nIn his final months Jackson was suffering from insomnia. Jackson went to bed with classical music playing on a sound system and Donald Duck playing on a computer. He told Lee: “All I want is to be able to sleep. He is exhausted with this kind of thing.”\n\nDrug use\n\nPainkillers\n\nIn November 1993, Jackson announced that he was dependent on painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. In a taped statement Jackson said: \"The pressure resulting from these false allegations, coupled with the incredible energy necessary for me to perform, caused so much distress that it left me physically and emotionally exhausted. His lawyers said Jackson would be treated for dependency overseas for one and a half months to two months. In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States. In November 1993 two lawyers, who had seen Jackson a few days before he had canceled his tour, described their impressions in a sworn declaration. Jackson's lawyer said these swings had continued over the next few days. She said she had been ”deeply concerned“ about Jackson's health. Propofol\nCherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he had asked her for unspecified \"products for sleep\". Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before and that he had been told it was safe. After Jackson's death Lee said in an interview: “He wasn’t looking to get high or feel good and sedated from drugs. This was a person who was seeking help, desperately, to get some sleep, to get some rest.”\n\nPatrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who had treated Jackson while he had been living in Ireland in 2006, stated that he had never seen any drugs in the house and had never been asked for narcotics. Jackson had always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol had been administered. Sexuality\n\nThere have been a lot of different rumors regarding Jackson's sexuality. People wondered whether he was homosexual or heterosexual. Some thought he was asexual. In the early 1980s, media reports stated that Jackson had never had a school chum or a steady girlfriend. Jackson later stated he had been too embarrassed to approach girls in school although he had liked them. He stated he had become romantically involved with actresses Tatum O'Neal and Brooke Shields. In 1993 Oprah Winfrey asked him if he was a virgin, which Jackson refused to answer, saying that would be something very private. Winfrey later admitted that the question had been embarrassing. Later that year Jackson was accused of having sexually abused a boy. In 1994 Jackson married his first wife Lisa Marie Presley. Presley said in an interview that the couple had sex. In early 1996 Presley filed for divorce. At the end of that year Jackson announced that his longtime friend Debbie Rowe, who had been working as a nurse for Jackson's dermatologist, was six months pregnant with his baby. He denied reports stating Rowe had been inseminated artificially. Rowe is the mother of two of Jackson's children. Jackson later said that many single mothers have children and fathers should have the same opportunity. In late 1999 she filed for divorce. Media reports state Jackson's third child was carried by a surrogate whose identity is unknown. Jackson said he had signed a  contractual agreement not to talk about her. Mental health\n\nAppearance\nJackson's physical changes attracted widespread media coverage and criticism from the public. Some African-American psychologists argued that Jackson was a poor role model for black youth. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson had given \"black youth a feeling that they can achieve\", but might encourage them to believe they had to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful. Halford Fairchild said Jackson and other African-American celebrities would try \"to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television\". When Jackson was approached in 2003 about people thinking he was obsessed with cosmetic surgery because of his distressed childhood he replied: “Well, I know what’s inside my head. That’s all.“\n\nIn his interview in 1993 Jackson also talked about the impact the speculations about his skin color had on him. \"It is something I cannot help,\" said Jackson. Jackson publicly said that he was proud to be black. Jackson's paternity of his three children is questioned in public due to their light skin color. Another theory says Jackson didn't want to look like his father. People close to Jackson say he didn't want to remove himself from the race. Eccentric lifestyle\nIn September 1986 the National Enquirer reported Jackson would sleep in an oxygen chamber to turn 150. Later editor Nick Maier declared that the story wasn't true. He said a polaroid of Jackson lying in the chamber was provided by Jackson's press representative. And Michael Jackson did exactly that. In the end, that backfired…“ Jackson used his eccentric image to cover his skin condition before speaking about it in public. Jackson said the acne had had a bad effect on his personality and depressed him. Jackson stated in his biography he had one of the most difficult periods in his life when he was making Off the Wall. Childhood\n\nIn his memoir Jackson described the relationship with his father Joe as “turbulent.” He stated he wouldn't know his father Joseph and had never been able “to have a real closeness with him.” He said Joseph found it hard to relate to his children beyond family business. Jackson said he had fought back and had hidden himself under tables. In his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey Jackson said there had been times when he had been so scared of his father that he would get sick and start to regurgitate when Joe had come to see him. In 2003 his father admitted having whipped Jackson with a switch and a belt. In a speech held at Oxford University in March 2001 Jackson said that his father had never shown him love. He said he had forgiven his father and encouraged parents to spend more time with their children. Jackson stated that he wouldn't have been so successful if Joseph hadn't been as strong. Jackson also said he missed a lot of his childhood. In his mid 30's Jackson said he was compensating for his lost childhood. Later he released a song about it. Child abuse allegations\nIn November 1993 Jackson's then lawyer Bertram Fields announced that his client would be treated for painkillers outside the U.S. He was barely able to function on an intellectual level.\" Later he stated: ”It was important to tell the truth. The lawyer resigned a few days later. The week before Jackson had given two depositions in a copyright issue. One of the plaintiffs‘ lawyers said: ”[Jackson] didn’t look tired at all. Health problems in June 2009\nAfter Jackson's death nurse Lee stated that she had received a frantic call on June 21, 2009 from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide had reported that Jackson had been feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She had advised the aide to take him to the hospital. Murray went to Jackson's residence and administered medical care. Jackson slept for several hours while Murray was at his bedside. On arrival Jackson was asystolic. Death was pronounced at 2.26 pm. Murray stated he had feared Jackson had been becoming addicted. Murray only handed over few documents referring to sporadic medical care he had provided since 2006 but no records referring to treatments in Jackson's final months. Following Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, said that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases while prescribing medications for Jackson. Police found a CD mentioning the \"Omar Arnold\" alias when they raided the Las Vegas, Nevada home and office of Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician. Second autopsy\nJackson's family sought a second autopsy which was performed by a private pathologist on June 27, 2009. Reverend Jesse Jackson said the family had a lot of questions. According to Sennef Murray said: “No he’s not taking anything. I just gave him a little bit of Lorazepam to help him sleep.” Murray told Sennef he had treated Jackson for dehydration and exhaustion. Blunt said when they prepared to transport Jackson to the hospital he saw Murray putting three bottles into a black bag. She said that Jackson had been “clinically dead” when he had arrived Cooper said Murray had told her Jackson had regularly taken valium and flomax and that he had given Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam via IV. After the second dose, Jackson went into arrest. He also said that, in his opinion, Jackson “was healthier than the average person of his age” and that the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual. Demerol injections\nShortly after Jackson's death speculation about his use of demerol surfaced. Murray's legal team argued that Jackson's insomnia had been caused by demerol and therefore he had needed propofol to get to sleep. According to medical records Klein had given Jackson botox and restylane to treat wrinkles and excessive perspiration. He said Jackson told him his insomnia was caused by “his creative mind always racing.” The expert testified he believed there was evidence that Jackson had been dependent on demerol, “possibly” addicted. In July 2009, Katherine Jackson and Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's two oldest children, reached a settlement pertaining to the care of Rowe's children, Prince and Paris. The agreement provided that the children would be raised by Katherine and Rowe would have visitation rights and would continue to receive the yearly payments to which Michael had agreed. As of 2011, Jackson resided at her home in Calabasas, California with her grandson, TJ Jackson, and his family. Jackson moved out of her Hayvenhurst home in Encino, California due to house renovations. On July 25, 2012, \n\n In his early 20s, while moonlighting in a blues band with his brother Luther, Joe met Katherine Scruse, whom he married in November 1949. (This was his second marriage, following a brief marriage that was annulled.) Joseph was alleged to have had a lasting extramarital affair. Katherine filed for divorce on March 9, 1973, with a Los Angeles County clerk, but she decided to drop the divorce papers. The following year, Joseph fathered a daughter with Cheryle Terrell who was named JohVonnie. This led Joseph and Cheryle to a 25-year-long affair while raising JohVonnie. Katherine attempted once again to divorce her husband in 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Joseph then moved to Las Vegas, with Katherine remaining at the Jackson family home Hayvenhurst in Encino, California. Despite living separately, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018. Katherine denied rumors that she and Joseph were estranged.\n\nQuestion: What was the name of Michael Jackson's second wife?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A famous quote of Shakespeare's Hamlet (II, ii, 115–117), expresses the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature: \"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in apprehension, how like a god! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?\" René Descartes famously and succinctly proposed: Cogito ergo sum (French: \"Je pense donc je suis\"; English: \"I think, therefore I am\"), not an assessment of humanity, but certainly reflecting a capacity for reasoning as a characteristic of humans, that potentially, could include individual self-reflection. From the hag and hungry goblin || that into rags would rend ye, ; And the spirits that stand || by the naked man || in the Book of Moons, defend ye! To err is human; || to forgive, divine. Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called ballad meter, or the common meter of the hymnodists (see also hymn), is usually thought of as a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of trimeter, but it can also be considered a line of heptameter with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot.

He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial at the first Nuremberg trials, where he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 20 January 1942, 15 high-ranking Nazi Party and German government officials met at a villa in Wannsee, a Berlin suburb, to coordinate the execution of the \"Final Solution\" (Endlösung) of the Jewish Question. At this Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler's deputy and head of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Main Office, or RSHA), noted the numbers of Jews to be eliminated in each territory. It was led by the SS functionary Walter Rauff, who helped develop the mobile gassing vehicles the Germans used to murder Russian prisoners and Jewish people in Russia and Poland. Heydrich died of his wounds on 4 June 1942. He was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and an important figure in the rise of Adolf Hitler. The assassination, codenamed Operation Anthropoid, was carried out by soldiers of the Czechoslovak Army after preparation and training by the British Special Operations Executive and with the approval of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, led by Edvard Beneš. The Czechoslovaks undertook the operation to help confer legitimacy on the government-in-exile, and to exact retribution for Heydrich's brutal rule. The operation was the only government-sponsored assassination of a senior Nazi leader during the Second World War. the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. His direct subordinate Adolf Eichmann headed the Gestapo's Office of Resettlement and then its Office of Jewish Affairs (Referat IV B4 or Sub-Department IV, Section B4).

Even though the formal proclamation was lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution. When he declared martial law in 1972, Marcos claimed that he had done so in response to the \"communist threat\" posed by the newly founded Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the sectarian \"rebellion\" of the Mindanao Independence Movement (MIM). Opposition figures of the time, such as Lorenzo Tañada, Jose Diokno, \n\n year. This discontent, the resulting resurgence of the opposition in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election, and the discovery of documents exposing his financial accounts and false war records led Marcos to call the snap election of 1986. Marcos then fled with his family to Hawaii. He was succeeded as president by Aquino's widow, Corazon \"Cory\" \n\n with economic downturns, these factors fermented dissent in various sectors (e.g. the urban middle class) that crystallised with the assassination of jailed oppositionist Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983, and widespread fraud in the 1986 snap elections. These eventually led to the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in Hawaii where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, Corazon, was installed as his successor.\n\nQuestion: Which President of the Philippines was deposed in 1986?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1900, the United States had no organized team for the 1900 Summer Olympics. On learning that Michigan's rival, the University of Chicago, was sending a delegation of athletes to the games in Paris, Pattengill led a fundraising effort to send some of Michigan's best athletes to the games. The effort raised sufficient funds to send four Michigan athletes and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick to Paris. One of the highlights for Michigan athletics during the Pattengill's time as chairman of the Athletic Boards came at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, which have sometimes been referred to as the \"Michigan Olympics.\" The Michigan medal winners were Archie Hahn (gold medals in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters), Ralph Rose (gold medal in the shot put, silver medal in the discus, and bronze medal in the hammer throw), Charles Dvorak (gold medal in the pole vault), Fred Schule (gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles), and William Coe (silver medal in the shot put). The United States had its worst showing at a Winter Olympics since the 1998 Nagano Games, ranking out of the top three in both the gold and total medal count with 9 and 23 medals respectively, and finished fourth in both rankings.

Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had stepped out of a limousine and walked toward the building's entrance when Mark David Chapman shot him four times in the back. Lennon was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. The Dakota has historically been home to many artists, actors, and musicians, including John Lennon, who was murdered in the archway of the building in 1980. The book disputes the official view of Lennon as a contented househusband raising his son Sean and baking bread while Yoko ran the family business. Instead, Nowhere Man portrays Lennon's daily life at the Dakota as that of a \"tormented superstar, a prisoner of his fame, locked in his bedroom raving about Jesus Christ, while a retinue of servants tended to his every need.\" British musician John Lennon, a building resident, was shot dead by Mark David Chapman outside the building on December 8, 1980. After the death of John Lennon, on December 8, 1980, public awareness of The Hit Factory increased; Lennon's final album had been recorded at The Hit Factory at 353 West 48th Street. Mourners and music fans around the world read accounts of the murder in newspapers on the days following the shooting, and The Hit Factory was mentioned in some of these publications. However, there are contradictory reports as to whether he was recording at The Hit Factory or the nearby Record Plant the day he was murdered. Most publications cite the Record Plant as the location. Witnesses present with John Lennon, such as producer Jack Douglas, cite the Record Plant as the studio where he spent his time recording and mixing tracks the evening of the murder. However, Keith Badman, not an eyewitness, in his book The Beatles: After the Break-up, 1970–2000 states that Lennon had been at The Hit Factory the night of his murder.

It was originally published as two children's books, The Tarzan Twins by Voland in October 1927, and Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, by Whitman in March 1936. The opening passage of \"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion\" specifies that its events occur immediately after those of \"The Tarzan Twins.\" Places and people from the original Tarzan novels are referred to, suggesting that Tarzan does or did exist in that universe. In a 1999 The Phantom story, Lord of the Jungle, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. In 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc began publishing webcomics on their official website including Tarzan by writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Grindberg and Tarzan of The Apes by Roy Thomas, artist Pablo Marcos, and colorist/letterer Oscar Gonzales. Tarzan the Ape Man is a 1932 pre-Code American action adventure film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer featuring Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous jungle hero Tarzan and starring Johnny Weissmuller, Neil Hamilton, C. Aubrey Smith and Maureen O'Sullivan. The film is loosely based on Burroughs' 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes, with the dialogue written by Ivor Novello. It is also the first appearance of Tarzan’s famous yell. Tarzan, a fictional character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first appeared in the 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes, and then in twenty-four sequels by Burroughs and numerous more by other authors.\n\nQuestion: In what year was the first Tarzan novel published?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition to spreading the word of Lister's pioneering work on antiseptics and widening the use of chloroform and morphine on the battlefield the ambulance helped to popularise a standardised method of treating bullet wounds which was based on Surgeon-General Sir Thomas Longmore's 1863 work with Minié rifle bullet wounds. MacCormac claimed that the adoption of this method was the primary reason for the low mortality rates achieved by the ambulance. Acadian was founded by Roland Dugas, Richard Zuschlag, and Richard Sturlese in response to funeral homes ceasing to provide ambulance services because of new, financially burdensome federal guidelines. They decided that it was time to create a private ambulance company and took their idea to the Lafayette Police Jury. Without the needed funds to get started, they decided to hire former Vietnam War medics to staff their new company, and raise funds through membership subscriptions. On July 21, 1971, the Police Jury authorized Acadian Ambulance Service, Inc. to be the emergency provider for Lafayette Parish. When Acadian first started, they had just 2 ambulances and 8 medics. A wilderness first responder is trained to provide pre-hospital care in remote settings who has skills relevant to ad hoc patient packaging and transport by non-motorized means. Even with such preparation, first responders face unique risks of being the first people to aid those with unknown contagions. Trauma\n\nEtymology\n\nThe use of the term “first responder” in the current sense first emerged in the 1970s. Perhaps the earliest uses in print occurred in two articles in the Boston Globe in August 1973 about proposed ambulance regulations in Massachusetts. They included an article in The Daly Sentinel (Grand Junction, CO) in March 1972, and another about the formation of a First Response Group composed of volunteers in the Burlington (VT) Free Press in April 1973.) One of the recommendations in the plan, reported the Herald, was that “All ambulance personnel and first-responders (who are general police and firemen) should be adequately trained in emergency care such as cardopulmonary [sic] resuscitation.” \n\nIt was also used in a July 1974 classified advertisement for a deputy chief of EMT training — “to assist in developing and implementing statewide training programs for EMT’s and first-responders” — from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The term began appearing in newspaper articles from other parts of the United States in the second half of 1974 and was in widespread use by 1975.

The Berlin assembly operation produced 1,177 Model Ts in 1926 and a further 2,594 during 1927 which was the Model T's final year: in August 1927 Model T production in Berlin ended, and it was nearly a year before, on 20 August 1928, Ford auto-production in Berlin recommenced, now of the Ford Model A. The Ford Motor Company of Canada, founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first internal combustion engines built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. Below are the numbers of Model T trucks produced each year, not including Canadian production. Built in 1904, it was the second center of automobile production for the Ford Motor Company, after the Ford Mack Avenue Plant. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, the company created and first produced the Ford Model T, the car credited with initiating the mass use of automobiles in the United States. Prior to the Model T, several other car models were assembled at the factory. Early experiments using a moving assembly line to make cars were also conducted there.

The white triangle at the flag represents liberty, equality, and fraternity. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down. The emblem of the African Union consists of a gold ribbon bearing small interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders. The African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State \n\nAt the base eight-pointed star, in the upper part of both the white and the green field are set two eight-pointed stars. The Emblem of the Republic of Abkhazia was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia on 23 July 1992, after it declared its secession from Georgia. The emblem of separatist Republic of Abkhazia is a shield divided vertically into white and green. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world.

The islands rest on the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, an oceanic ridge and plateau, and extend 2,550 km north and south across the equator, from latitude 14º N to 8º S. Lakshadweep lies to the north, 300 km west of India's southwest coast. Lakshadweep consists of 36 small islands between 8º - 14º N, with a total land area of 32 km2. The Maldives are the largest island group, with approximately 1190 islands between 7º N and the equator. Diego \n\n The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which occurred on December 26 that year, caused great damage in both Maldives and Sri Lanka, as well as other Indian Ocean nations. Official and economic relations between the neighbouring Indian Ocean countries of the Maldives and Sri Lanka, have been positive since the Maldives became independent in 1965. The Maldives has an average estimated elevation of 1.5 meters above sea-level, with 80 percent of its islands currently resting less than 1 meter above sea-level. The total landmass of the islands is continuously decreasing due to rising sea-levels, and many of the smaller islands are thought to be years away from becoming completely submerged. Climate change has recently become a long-term security issue for the Maldives which, according to numerous climate scientists, could disappear entirely within one or two centuries. Rising ocean temperatures are also a major environmental challenge \n\n Maldives is located south of India's Lakshadweep Islands in the Indian Ocean.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the group of 1,196 islands in the North Indian Ocean, none bigger than five square miles?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Author Diana Darke has written that \"The city has long been multi-cultural, a complex mix of Kurds, Iranians, Turkmen, Armenians and Circassians overlaid on an Arab base in which multi-denominational churches and mosques still share the space.\" European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo's decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo. Archaeological findings in Deir Ezzor indicate that the area has been inhabited since the ninth millennium BC.

King Louis XVI himself attempted to escape with his family to Varennes in June 1791, but he was caught. The French king was put under surveillance, and increasingly suspected of conspiring with other European monarchs, who wished to preserve the House of Bourbon in France and restore its pre-revolutionary authority. The two fall in love during the tumultuous stirrings of the French Revolution, their romance playing out amid encounters with major Revolutionary figures such as Georges Jacques Danton, Maximilien de Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins. This convocation was one of the events that transformed the general economic and political malaise of the country into the French Revolution. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution. Louis XVII (born Louis Charles, Duke of Normandy; 27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795) was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as the king of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic and since Louis-Charles died in June 1795, he never actually ruled. With powerful members, such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton, the Jacobin Club, a French political party established in 1790, at the birth of the revolution, managed to secure control of the government and pursue the revolution to their own ends, culminating in a \"Reign of Terror\".\n\nQuestion: Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the language of the Bulgarians. It is the official language of Bulgaria, and since 2007 has been among the official languages of the European Union. In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007. Pomaks (Помаци; Πομάκοι; Pomaklar) are Bulgarian-speaking Muslims inhabiting Bulgaria, northeastern Greece and mainly northwestern Turkey. The c. 220,000 strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is known officially as Bulgarian Muslims. They speak various Bulgarian dialects and those spoken in Greece and Turkey are referred to there as the Pomak language. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak,   ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other. Bulgarians are the main ethnic group in Bulgaria, according to the census of the population in 2011 they are 6,000,000 people, or 86% of the country's population.\n\nQuestion: What is the principal language of Bulgaria?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the city landmark of Moscow, with iconic buildings such as Saint Basil's Cathedral, Lenin's Mausoleum and the GUM. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. It belongs to the Diocese of Rostov and Novocherkassk. Erected in the early 20th century, it is considered to be an object of Russian cultural heritage. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire.

Frederick sent an ultimatum to Saladin, demanding the return of Palestine and challenging him to battle and in May 1189, Frederick's host departed for Byzantium. Latin Christians responded in 1189 by launching the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus, and Frederick Barbarossa separately. In 1187, the Ayyubid Sultan Salah ad-Din led his armies to win a great victory over the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin. The Christian defeat led to a Third Crusade aimed to regain the lost territories in the Holy Land.

It is also called the Crusade of the Faint-Hearted due to the number of participants who joined this crusade after having turned back from the First Crusade. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187, and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July.

Stalin proposed a one-party constitution when Liu Shaoqi visited the Soviet Union in 1952. When the Communists gained complete control of Mainland China in 1949, two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, fled to Taiwan. On October 1, 1949 the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) unification campaign led by Sun Yat-sen's successor, Chiang Kai-shek. The Party, still led by urban intellectuals, developed a radical agenda of mass mobilization, labor organization, rural uprisings, anti-imperialism, and national unification. Mao Zedong, whose Autumn Harvest Uprising had been a spectacular failure in mobilizing local peasants, never-the-less became Party leader and established rural bases and creation of the Chinese Red Army to protect them. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) Mao led a rectification campaign to emphasize Maoism and his leadership and after the war he led the Party to victory in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949). But in 1926 KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, after the conclusion of the Northern Expedition, Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the Chinese Civil War which would last until 1949, a few months after the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, led by Mao Zedong. With the Kuomintang's defeat & retreat to Taiwan, Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\n\nQuestion: Who proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Habsburg Castle is the original seat of the House of Habsburg, which became one of the leading imperial and royal dynasties in Europe. The original coat of arms to fly over Habsburg Castle, a red lion on a golden field, remained part of the Austrian arms up to the end of the imperial period. The area around the castle was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed. After the war, Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III. ordered the demolition of the castle, possibly out of fear for it being an \"unconquerable fort of anti-Habsburg resistance\". Castle palaces, chapel and other parts of the bastion were used as a granary, devaluating the whole complex, yet protecting it from being rebuilt. The castle stayed in Czernin's hands until the nationalization in 1945. Laxenburg castles are imperial palaces and castles outside Vienna, in the town of Laxenburg owned in equal parts by Vienna and Lower Austria. The castles became a Habsburg possession in 1333 and formerly served as a summer retreat, along with Schönbrunn palace, for the imperial Habsburg dynasty. Blauer Hof Palace was the birthplace of some members of the royal family, including Crown Prince Rudolf. Another castle nearby is named Franzensburg castle. Today the castles are used for events, conferences, and concerts. The castle was built around 1020 by Count Radbot, of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and Werner, Bishop of Strasbourg. They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276.\n\nQuestion: In which country is the castle that gives the Habsburg dynasty its name?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim.

A brief period of peace followed the March 1802 Treaty of Amiens before British-French relations deteriorated, leading to the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803. In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French Grande Armée invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz. Having failed to dislodge the Austrians, Bonaparte contemplated a retreat behind the Adda River and potentially abandoning the blockade of Mantua. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again. Stripping Vaubois and Kilmaine of every available man, Bonaparte fell upon Alvinczi at the Battle of Arcola on 15–17 November and defeated the Austrians.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Voting last took place in all 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 12 December 2019. The number of seats rose from 646 to 650 at the 2010 general election after proposals made by the boundary commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies) were adopted through statutory instruments.

The Parliament of the United Kingdom (at the Palace of Westminster) legislates on matters such as taxation, foreign policy, defence, employment and trade. For elections to the House of Commons of this parliament, the city area is divided among five United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies, with each constituency returning one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons has a quorum of 40 MPs, including the Speaker, out of 650 members of the House.

It then changed its name to the more descriptive Ecology Party in 1975, and to the Green Party ten years later. The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour. The Green Party argued that this made him the first Green representative in the House of Commons. Caroline Patricia Lucas (born 9 December 1960) is a British politician who has twice led the Green Party of England and Wales and has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brighton Pavilion since the 2010 general election. She joined the Green Party in 1986 and held various party roles, also serving on Oxfordshire County Council from 1993 to 1997. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and shared control of Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration. In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008. According to MORI in 2010, Green issues were rated as importantly as during the Green Party's previous high point in the late 1980s. After joining the Ecology Party in 1977 (later becoming the Green Party of England and Wales), Lambert has held numerous positions, including Co-Chair of the Party Council (1982–85), Principal Speaker (1992–93 and 1998–99), Chair of the Party Executive (1993–94), Representative to the Federation of European Green Parties (1987–89 and 1998–99) and Political Liaison to the Green Group in the European Parliament (1989–92).\n\nQuestion: What was the former name of the British Green Party?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Churchill served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the bulk of World War II. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 1940–41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Nazi Germany. He succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister on 10 May 1940 and held the post until 26 July 1945. Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British re-armament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As prime minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy. Winston Churchill, who had long warned against Nazi Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after his predecessor Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the German invasion of Norway in April 1940.\n\nQuestion: Who were the two prime ministers of Britain during World War II?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In a system based on multi-seat districts, it elects multiple candidates in a district and may be referred to as winner-takes-all, bloc voting or plurality block voting. William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority. In some votes, the winning candidate or proposition may have only a plurality, depending on the rules of the organization holding the vote. in the United States, the lower house (Lok Sabha) in India, elections to the British House of Commons and English local elections in the United Kingdom, France (run-off election) and federal and provincial elections in Canada (although prior to 1956 three provinces used ranked voting in provincial elections). Both plurality and majoritarian systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies. In the latter \n\n Plurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations. That makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials.

The tu is used in a disparaging way for Louis-Napoléon. It would be unthinkable that anybody should address the Emperor of the French in such a way. This form of address may denote familiarity between friends, but this is not Hugo's intention and it is used purely to belittle a futile leader.

They claimed that they were more democratic than the Republicans, they mocked the Monarchists and they opposed Adolphe Thiers in his wish to tear up the low-tariff treaties of the empire. The Bonapartists did not have consistent views on democracy. Their program was deliberately vague, leaving it to the people to choose the form of the regime. Bonaparte trained as a lawyer. In that role and as a politician and diplomat, he served in the Cinq-Cents and as the French ambassador to Rome. In 1795 Bonaparte was a member of the Council of Ancients. Most Bonapartists were nevertheless conservative, emphasising that the foundation of society was the family, religion and property, and the people should respect the social authorities. The effect was to cause some confusion between the Bonapartist and monarchist (legitimist or Orléanist) groups, who sometimes worked together to avoid splitting the vote in elections.\n\nQuestion: What word for unthinking patriotism is derived from the name of one of Napoleon's admirers?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. However, the first successful designs have been attributed to Atherton; a Warrington machine builder who helped Sir Richard Arkwright whilst in his late twenties. By 1787 his inventions relating to the automation \n\n steam engine would be essential to the development of a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably Trevithick's Puffing Devil, in 1801, and his later London Steam Carriage of 1803, which circumvented Watt's condenser patent by simply removing it. Watt, for example, wanted to have Trevithick imprisoned because of the danger his high-pressure engines introduced. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802.\n\nQuestion: Which builder of steam engines formed a successful partnership with Matthew Boulton?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Coldry Process is applied to brown coal (lignite) with a typical moisture content of 60 per cent by weight and transforms the coal into a densified coal product of equal or better calorific value (5,800 kcal/kg) to typical export quality black coal, with less ash and sulfur content. Black coal equivalent derived from brown coal is ostensibly a 'cleaner' burning coal fuel than most black coals. To solve the problem of energy shortage after the deforestation in the area, Rhenanus experimented with brown coal beginning in 1563, which was discovered a few years earlier in the area of the nearby mountain \"Hoher Meissner\". The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. The densification process raises the calorific value of low-rank coal to equal or exceed that of many export-grade black coals. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal.

Alternatively the term \"Fining\" is used, in this case, \"refining\" refers to the chemical processes only. Refining is supported by high temperature and stirring, as well as chemical reactions caused by refining agents. For the most common types of glass production sulfate raw materials are used, in particular, Na2SO4, decomposing into SO2 and O2. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. Other substances are therefore added to simplify processing. This is calcium oxide (CaO), generally obtained from limestone. In addition, magnesium oxide (MgO) and alumina, which is aluminium oxide (Al2O3), contribute to the durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight. Borosilicate glass is created by combining and melting boric oxide, silica sand, soda ash, and alumina. In addition to quartz, sodium carbonate, and aluminium oxide traditionally used in glassmaking, boron is used in the manufacture of borosilicate glass. Though more difficult to make than traditional glass due to its high melting temperature, it is economical to produce. The two types differ in the application, production method (float process for windows, blowing and pressing for containers), and chemical composition. Flat glass has a higher magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than container glass, and a lower silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content.\n\nQuestion: What raw material is used for making glass?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Their cell walls are made of chitin, a cholesterol-lowering dietary fiber. The common white mushroom was first cultivated by the French more than 300 years ago in abandoned gypsum quarries near Paris, but only recently has it become possible to cultivate a number of other species on a commercial scale. Truffles grow underground among the roots of certain oak, hazel, and linden trees. As a result of overharvesting and deforestation, truffles are now so rare and expensive that only minute shavings are used to flavor dishes. Attempts to grow them on a commercial scale have been unsuccessful so far. Burgundy truffles (truffe de Bourgogne; tartufo nero di Fragno or scorzone, \"bark\"; trufa de verano; svart sommartryffel), have a hazelnut-like aroma and are prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the haute cuisine of France and Italy, sometimes as a less expensive, milder substitute for the Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum) when the latter are not available. Like other truffles, they are also packaged for export. With bodies (ascocarps) from 2 to 10 cm in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species.

The primary cell wall enables plant cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the internal hydrostatic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall. This pressure is vital for cell expansion during growth and provides mechanical rigidity to plant tissues. Cellulose, being a strong and rigid polysaccharide, provides the primary cell wall with its mechanical strength. This allows plant cells to sustain their internal pressure and prevents them from collapsing or losing their shape. Furthermore, the presence of cellulose in the primary cell wall contributes to the resilience of plant cells. When a plant cell is subjected to mechanical stress, cellulose provides resistance and helps maintain the integrity of the cell wall. In summary, cellulose plays a crucial role in the primary cell wall of plants by providing tensile strength and contributing to the overall strength, resilience, and plasticity of plant cells. Its presence allows plant cells to develop turgor pressure, sustain internal hydrostatic pressure, and maintain their structural integrity even under mechanical stress. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules. the network of cellulose and cross-linking glycans provides tensile strength, while the pectin network resists compression. Cellulose, cross-linking glycans, and pectin are typically present in roughly equal amounts in a primary cell wall. the middle lamella is especially rich in pectin, and it cements adjacent cells together. Once a plant cell has left the meristem where it is generated, it can grow dramatically, commonly by more than a thousand times in volume. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that they deposit in the wall (Figure 19–64). Further components of secondary walls of plants are cross-linked phenolic polymers called lignin, which are responsible for mechanical strengthening of the wall. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. The formation of plant primary cell walls involves several components. Certain types of pectins are particularly abundant in the middle lamella, which is the region that cements adjacent cell walls together. Overall, the formation of plant primary cell walls involves the complex interplay between polysaccharides, including cellulose and pectins, and proteins. This combination of components provides strength, flexibility, and the ability to remodel the cell wall as necessary during plant growth.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the strong material found in plant cell walls?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The process is thus: Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2 °C) heating or cooling in buildings. For molecules of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling. In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient \"adiabatic approximation\". There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated. temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the change of state from liquid to gas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, \n\n Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach sequences to others. Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven.

While most big cat species are either solitary ambush predators or pack hunters, cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are primarily solitary pursuit predators. Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal with running speeds reaching 61 –, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for up to a distance of approximately 500 yd, which is only about 20 seconds of sprinting, before fatigue and overheating set in. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed quietly walking towards the prey to shorten the distance before running at \n\n The record is 44.72 km/h (27.78 mph), measured between meter 60 and meter 80 of the 100 meters sprint at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics by Usain Bolt. Compared to quadrupedal animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but incapable of great speed. Examples of animals with higher sprinting speeds include cheetahs which can attain short bursts of speed well over 100 km/h (62 mph), the American quarter horse has topped 88 km/h (55 mph), greyhounds can reach 70 km/h (43 mph), and the Mongolian wild ass has been measured at 64 km/h (40 mph). The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second, while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate. This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at 1.86 m/s or 171 body lengths per second.

It is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. This selective absorption of light is why chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules capture photons of light energy. In this stage, chlorophyll helps convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) through a series of chemical reactions. Overall, chlorophyll's ability to absorb light energy and transfer it to other molecules allows plants to carry out photosynthesis efficiently. Its green color arises from its selective absorption properties, reflecting or transmitting green light while absorbing other colors from the visible spectrum. Reference:\n- Chlorophyll (Wikipedia)\n\n Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that obtain energy via photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in \n\n increased cytosine methylation. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide.\n\nQuestion: What is the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Issues include funding for research and educational programs, government regulations and permits for research activities, decision-making in habitat and biodiversity management, the impacts of birds on fisheries, in agriculture and in urban areas, threatened species, the role of birds in ecosystems, and standards concerning the use and maintenance of live birds in research. The Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds was written by the English naturalist and army officer George Montagu, and first published by J. It was one of the texts, along with Thomas Bewick's contemporaneous A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The first edition was admired by biologists including Charles Darwin and David Lack. Birds and People is a ten-year-long, groundbreaking collaboration between the publishers Random House and BirdLife International, to survey and document worldwide, the cultural significance of birds. Established by the leading naturalist and author Mark Cocker in collaboration with the eminent wildlife photographer David Tipling and the Natural history specialist, Jonathan Elphick, the Birds and People project is a new experiment in natural history and cultural anthropology. \"The sense of freedom evoked by birds in flight has been a source of inspiration alike to tribal communities and the world’s major civilisations.

Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995 to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016. The largest producer of industrial carrageenan was the Philippines, where cultivated seaweed produces about 80% of the world supply, while China is the main exporter to global markets in the US and Europe.

Hemoproteins\nHuman proteins\n\n MyoD, also known as myoblast determination protein 1, is a protein in animals that plays a major role in regulating muscle differentiation. In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene. Nevertheless, the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis. The physiological role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the body is primarily related to their ability to bind molecular oxygen. On the other hand, myoglobin is a monomeric protein mainly found in muscle tissue and serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. Both hemoglobin and myoglobin have a heme group, which contains iron that binds to oxygen. Each myoglobin molecule contains a single heme group inserted into a hydrophobic cleft in the protein. In summary, hemoglobin and myoglobin play crucial roles in oxygen transport and storage in the body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the body, while myoglobin stores oxygen within muscle tissue. Both proteins rely on their heme groups, which bind and release oxygen as needed. Myoglobin (Mb) plays a significant role in terms of protein structure and oxygen storage. It is a small, globular protein primarily responsible for storing oxygen in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. In terms of protein structure, early studies on myoglobin were important milestones in the field of protein structure determination. In terms of its role in oxygen storage, myoglobin helps regulate cellular oxygen tension in respiring tissues. This further highlights the physiological significance of myoglobin beyond its role in oxygen storage. It's worth mentioning that recent research involving myoglobin has included the development of assays for serum myoglobin detection and additives to preserve the red coloring of fresh meat. The study of myoglobin has also extended to non-muscle tissues of fish species and mammalian cancer cells, suggesting its potential involvement in other biological processes. Overall, myoglobin's significance lies in its role as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue and its contribution to regulating cellular oxygen tension and the bioavailability of nitric oxide.

Some ruminants like cows and sheep contain certain symbiotic anaerobic bacteria (such as Cellulomonas and Ruminococcus spp.) in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include dockerins and carbohydrate-binding modules. water and nutrient absorption of most plants and confers resistance to some plant pathogens. They are vital to agriculture and are important to almost all species of plants many species co-evolving with the fungi. \"Mycelium\", like \"fungus\", can be considered a mass noun, a word that can be either singular or plural. Complex enzymes are secreted by the various fungi, converting cellulose into a carbon form that can be utilized by the fungus, and subsequently any organism up the food chain. Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins. Bacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short-chain fatty acids by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose.

Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called \"soldier\" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their \"duties\" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution.

Anthrozoology (also known as \"human–animal studies\") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy. During the 1960s and 1970s, human ethologists faced several challenges when they began studying human behavior. Ethologists were accustomed to studying animal behavior, which often involved direct observation and experimentation. However, studying human behavior posed different challenges. Unlike animals in controlled laboratory settings, studying humans required access to natural environments such as kindergartens, schools, and communities. This was particularly important to ensure that the behavior being studied was a true representation of natural human behavior. Another challenge was the conceptual shift from studying animal behavior to studying human behavior. Ethologists had to adapt their knowledge and methodologies to the unique characteristics of human behavior. Studying human behavior raised questions about privacy, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of human subjects. Overall, the challenges faced by human ethologists in the 1960s and 1970s included developing appropriate methodologies for studying human behavior in natural settings, adapting to the unique characteristics of human behavior, and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding the study of human subjects. It draws on concepts and findings from both neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Historically, most empirical work in this field has focused on comparative neuroanatomy. One related field is comparative psychology, which examines behavior across different species to understand the evolution of cognitive abilities. By studying the evolutionary origins of neural circuits involved in behaviors such as foraging or mate selection, evolutionary neuroscience can shed light on how these circuits have been shaped by natural selection. Behavioral ecology examines how animals' behaviors are influenced by ecological factors. Finally, evolutionary psychology investigates how psychological traits may have evolved through natural selection. Unlike classical ethology, which focuses on the evolutionary, functional, mechanistic, and developmental aspects of behavior, phenomenology explores the mental processes and subjective experiences of animals. This approach encompasses empirical observations that offer preliminary insights into the behavior pattern, such as carrying the tail in mice.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the study of animal behavior?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In mosses, cyanobacteria are major nitrogen fixers and grow mostly epiphytically, aside from two species of Sphagnum which protect the cyanobiont from an acidic-bog environment. In terrestrial Arctic environments, cyanobionts are the primary supplier of nitrogen to the ecosystem whether free-living or epiphytic with mosses. Cyanobacterial associations with liverworts are rare, with only four of 340 genera of liverworts harbouring symbionts. Two of the genera, Marchantia and Porella, are epiphytic, while the genera Blasia and Cavicularia are endophytic. Bryophytes and their cyanobacterial symbionts possess different structures \n\n along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. Yes, the stomata in highly elaborated Oedipodium and highly reduced Ephemerum moss sporophytes are remarkably similar. The ultrastructure of stomata in these mosses is highly similar to each other, and less variable compared to tracheophytes (vascular plants). However, there are some subtle differences between the two moss species. Oedipodium sporophytes have extensive spongy tissue along the apophysis, while Ephemerum has minimal substomatal cavities. Additionally, the sporophytes of both mosses are covered by a cuticle that is thicker on the guard cells and extends along the walls surrounding the pore. These anatomical features in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses support the role of stomata in gas exchange and water transport during development and maturation. Overall, while there are some differences in specific anatomical features, the ultrastructure of stomata in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses is remarkably similar, highlighting the importance of stomata in land plants for gas exchange, water transport, and potentially spore dispersal.\n\nQuestion: Mosses are classified as belonging to which part of the plant kingdom?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They are covered with short, thick fur of medium to dark brown color. The tail is long and typically very bushy. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. They glide using a flap of skin called a patagium. They are a non-migrating species and typically stay near areas in which they were born. The POW flying squirrel tends to utilize dens in tree cavities or snags for storing food, hiding from predators, and reproduction. They do not spend much time on the ground in order to avoid predation. Northern flying squirrels are considered to be one of the most aerodynamic of mammals with the ability to travel between 3 and 45 meters in one glide. They travel between the trees to feed and in search of dens. These squirrels range in length from 13 to 27 cm, not including the tail which is often about the same length as the body. Most are rather dull olive-brown to gray and several have a pale and dark stripe on their side, however a few are very colorful. The Pallas's squirrel may have an unremarkable olive-gray back, while its belly is often –but not always– bright red. They are solitary, and give birth to one to five young. Their food consists of nuts, fruits, and seeds, and also of insects and bird eggs. The mountain ground squirrel (Geosciurus princeps) is a rodent that is native to southwestern Angola, western Namibia, and western South Africa. It is the closest relative of the Cape ground squirrel (Latin name Geosciurus inauris), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. Geosciurus princeps is slightly larger, on average, than G. inauris, although there is considerable overlap in body size.\n\nQuestion: Which rodent rears its young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the last couple of decades, developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. Connective tissues are fibreous tissues. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism. The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces such as the surface of skin, the airways, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss. Epithelial tissues help in elimination of waste. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ. Lateral Meristem - This meristem consist of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth. Intercalary Meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. Schlerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long and narrow and unicellular. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. Xylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids ends overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. use structures called phragmoplasts to organize and guide the growing cell plate. In these plants, the microtubules of the telophase spindle give rise to the phragmoplast and are oriented perpendicular to the plane of cell division and the forming cell plate. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. The upward movement, known as the xylem pathway, occurs from the roots to the stems and leaves. This process is driven by transpiration, a process where water evaporates from the plant's leaves, creating a suction force that pulls water and nutrients upward. The xylem vessels in plants are responsible for this upward transportation of nutrients. The phloem vessels are responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds synthesized in the leaves to the rest of the plant, including the roots.\n\nQuestion: What has a central vein called a midrib?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife \n\n to protect the overall diversity of a landscape. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Beavers often chose this lidard's tail plant rather than other plants that may thrive within the area.

A macrophyte is a plant that grows in or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or floating. Some plants have the capability of  absorbing  pollutants \n\n their tissue. Seaweeds are multicellular marine algae and, although their ecological impact is similar to other larger water plants, they are not typically referred to as macrophytes. Aquatic plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water, or at the water's surface. The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is frequently saturated with water. They are therefore a common component of wetlands. Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture ), also known as aquafarming, is the controlled cultivation (\"farming\") of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. Mariculture, commonly known as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats, opposed to in freshwater aquaculture. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). The name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large \"meadows\" resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. These plants have adaptations that allow them to withstand the wet conditions, such as their ability to tolerate waterlogged soil and their specialized structures for nutrient uptake. Overall, large way vegetation is characterized by its ability to flourish in wetland environments and fulfill important ecological functions.\n\nQuestion: What is the generic word for plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful. In other cases, your wisdom teeth can become impacted or only partially erupt through the gum in a misalignment. They can also put pressure on the adjacent teeth, which can result in permanent damage to these otherwise healthy teeth and their surrounding bone. Sometimes, impacted or partially impacted wisdom teeth can also lead to the formation of cysts, and in worse case scenarios even tumors, which could potentially destroy an entire section of your jaw. Whether your dentist or a specialist is performing the extraction the procedure is the same. The likeliness of lingering numbness, jaw fracture or other complications also increases with age. Lastly, the longer you leave a troublesome wisdom tooth in your mouth, the longer it has to cause further problems in the future. A fully grown up adult will have 32 teeth in mouth, 8 teeth in each quarter of a mouth. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. Lower wisdom teeth are very commonly infected. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath. Since wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. The listed dentists of India Dental Clinic would rather first adopt a conservative dental treatment approach of just monitoring the eruption progress of wisdom teeth of both upper and lower jaw. However, there are rare instances when a sinus perforation will not heal and a fistula develops that represents a communication between your mouth and sinus cavity. It is also faced as a complication of removing a tooth, or from infection or trauma. Sometimes the roots of a tooth are so close to the bone under a maxillary sinus that the bone is damaged when the tooth is removed. Impacted wisdom teeth is a condition where the third molars (wisdom teeth) are prevented from erupting into the mouth. This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position. Completely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms. Partially erupted wisdom teeth can develop cavities or pericoronitis. Wisdom teeth likely become impacted because of a mismatch between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaw. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. Impacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. Supporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry. It was the meeting of sterile technique, radiology, and anesthesia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that allowed the more routine management of impacted wisdom teeth. Classification\nAll teeth are classified as either developing, erupted (into the mouth), embedded (failure to erupt despite lack of blockage from another tooth), or impacted. Impacted teeth are ones that fail to erupt due to blockage from other teeth. Wisdom teeth, as the last teeth to erupt in the mouth are the most likely to become impacted. They develop between the ages of 14 and 25, with 50% of root formation completed by age 16, and 95% of all teeth erupted by the age of 25, however, some tooth movement can continue beyond the age of 25. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease. One review found that 11% of wisdom teeth will have evidence of disease and are symptomatic, 0.6% will be symptomatic but have no disease, 51% will be asymptomatic but have disease present and 37% will be asymptomatic and have no disease. Each of these factors is used to predict the difficulty (and rate of complications) when removing an impacted tooth, with age being the most reliable predictor rather than the orientation of the impaction. Another classification system often taught in U.S. dental schools is known as Pell and Gregory Classification. This system includes a horizontal and vertical component to classify the location of third molars (predominately applicable to lower third molars): the third molar's relationship to the level of the teeth already in the mouth, being the vertical or x-component and to the anterior border of the ramus being the horizontal or y-component. Signs and symptoms\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth without communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms. The chances of developing pathology on an impacted wisdom tooth that is not communicating with the mouth is approximately 12%. The tissue overlying the tooth is called the operculum, and the disorder is called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'. Since the tooth never erupts, however, the dental follicle that surrounds the tooth does not degenerate during eruption, and can develop cysts or uncommon tumors over time. Estimates of the incidence of cysts or other neoplasms (almost all benign) around impacted teeth average at 3%, usually seen in people under the age of 40. For partially impacted teeth in those over 20 year of age, the most common pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the impacted tooth. The next most common pathology seen is cavities or tooth decay. The rate of cavities on the back of the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age. Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease. Crowding of the front teeth is not believed to be caused by the eruption of wisdom teeth although this is a reason many dental clinicians use to justify wisdom teeth extraction.,\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of impaction can be made clinically if enough of the wisdom tooth is visible to determine its angulation, depth, and if the patient is old enough that further eruption or uprighting is unlikely. Wisdom teeth continue to move to the age of 25 years old due to eruption, and then continue some later movement owing to periodontal disease. If the tooth cannot be assessed with clinical exam alone, the diagnosis is made using either a panoramic radiograph or cone-beam CT. Where unerupted wisdom teeth still have eruption potential several predictors are used to determine the chance of the teeth becoming impacted. The ratio of space between the tooth crown length and the amount of space available, the angle of the teeth compared to the other teeth are the two most commonly used predictors, with the space ratio being the most accurate. Despite the capacity for movement into early adulthood, the likelihood that the tooth will become impacted can be predicted when the ratio of space available to the length of the crown of the tooth is under 1. Once there is the possibility of the teeth developing disease, then a discussion about the operative risks versus long-term risk of retention with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or other clinician trained to evaluate wisdom teeth is recommended. Screening at a younger age may be required if the second molars (the \"12-year molars\") fail to erupt as ectopic positioning of the wisdom teeth can prevent their eruption. Treatment\nWisdom teeth that are fully erupted and in normal function need no special attention and should be treated just like any other tooth. It is more challenging, however to make treatment decisions with asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth where there is a high probability that the teeth will develop disease over time, but none exists on examination, or on x-rays (see Treatment controversy below). In 2000, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom set guidelines to discontinue the removal of asymptomatic disease-free third molars in the UK National Health Service, stating that there was no reliable research evidence to support a health benefit to patients from the prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molar teeth, in addition to the risks of removal and cost to the service. Those who argue against a blanket moratorium on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars and that there are costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point to the fact that there is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the dental arch. There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom teeth. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association. If it is decided to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection). The roots have also been reported to migrate in 13.2% to 85.9% of cases. Prognosis\nThe prognosis for impacted wisdom teeth depends on the depth of the impaction. When they lack a communication to the mouth, the main risk is the chance of a cyst or neoplasm forming in the tissues around the tooth (such as the dental follicle), which is relatively uncommon. Once communicating with the mouth, the onset of disease or symptoms cannot be predicted but the chance of it does increase with age. Epidemiology\nFew studies have looked at the percentage of the time wisdom teeth are present or the rate of wisdom teeth eruption. The lack of up to five teeth (excluding third molars, i.e. wisdom teeth) is termed hypodontia. Missing third molars occur in 9-30% of studied populations. One large scale study on a group of young adults in New Zealand showed 95.6% had at least 1 wisdom tooth with an eruption rate of 15% in the maxilla and 20% in the mandible. Another study on 5000 army recruits found 10,767 impacted wisdom teeth. The frequency of impacted lower third molars was found to be 72% in a Swedish study, and the frequency of retained impacted wisdom teeth that are free of disease and symptoms is estimated to be between 11.6% to 29%, a percentage which drops with age. Other texts from about this time speculate on their de-evolution, that they are prone to decay and discussion on whether or not they lead to crowding of the other teeth. References\n\nExternal links \n\nOral surgery\nArticles containing video clips\nAcquired tooth pathology\n\n Hypodontia is defined as the developmental absence of one or more teeth excluding the third molars. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Hypodontia: one to six missing teeth excluding the third molars 2. Oligodontia: six or more missing permanent teeth excluding the third molars 3. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth\n\n Typically, all baby teeth will be present by the age of three. As for all adult teeth, they erupt between the ages 6 to 14, with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age. If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken.\n\nQuestion: Which teeth are the third molars, and are always the last to0 erupt?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. On the other hand, glucagon, which is released by alpha cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect of raising blood sugar levels. Many tissues monitor the levels of glucose in the blood, but pancreatic islet cells are particularly important in this process. When blood glucose levels deviate from the desired range, the pancreas adjusts insulin and glucagon secretion accordingly to restore balance. In summary, blood sugar levels are regulated through a complex interplay of hormones, primarily insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas. Insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose, while glucagon stimulates the release of stored glucose. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to a meal. Such downregulation underlies insulin resistance, which is common in type 2 diabetes. The insulin oscillations are generated by pulsatile release of the hormone from the pancreas. Since each islet contains up to 2000 beta cells and there are one million islets in the pancreas it is apparent that pulsatile secretion requires sophisticated synchronization both within and among the islets of Langerhans. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. The levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important. Glucagon\nIf the blood glucose level falls to dangerously low levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon, a hormone which travels through the blood to  the liver, where it binds to glucagon receptors on the surface of liver cells and stimulates them to break down glycogen stored inside the cells into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis). The cells release the glucose into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. Insulin\nWhen levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of glycogen conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called glycogenesis), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar.

They form a shallow groove at the line of their junction, which form the atrioventricular groove. The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart. In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The left atrium and left ventricle are referred to as the left heart, while the right atrium and right ventricle are known as the right heart. This four-chambered structure allows for efficient blood flow and separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, the blood moves into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood into the pulmonary circulation - the pathway leading to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure that it moves in a unidirectional manner. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid. It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body. Reference:\n\"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals...\"\n\nThe heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Structure\n\nLocation and shape\n\nThe human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels—the venae cavae, aorta and pulmonary trunk. The largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest (though occasionally it may be offset to the right) and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body parts. Because the heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger. Chambers\n\nThe heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus. The fibrous cardiac skeleton gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum, which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings, which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract. Valves\n\nThe heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle. The valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. Two additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta. Right heart\n\nThe right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. It arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. Left heart\n\nThe left heart has two chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle, separated by the mitral valve. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood back from the lungs via one of the four pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve. The left ventricle is much thicker as compared with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart muscle; the left coronary artery is above the left cusp of the valve,  and the right coronary artery is above the right cusp. Wall\n\nThe heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium. The innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium. It is made up of a lining of simple squamous epithelium and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively. There are two types of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to contract easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The tough outer surface of the pericardium is called the fibrous membrane. This is lined by a double inner membrane called the serous membrane that produces pericardial fluid to lubricate the surface of the heart. The part of the serous membrane attached to the fibrous membrane is called the parietal pericardium, while the part of the serous membrane attached to the heart is known as the visceral pericardium. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. It does this by branching into smaller arteries—diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining the back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, as well as to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Development\n\nThe heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. The heart derives from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the cardiogenic region. Between the third and fourth week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the formation of the septa and the valves and the remodeling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week, the septa are complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves are complete. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale was, called the fossa ovalis. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs. The right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. In the left heart, oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Cardiac cycle\n\nThe cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat. The period of time during which the ventricles contract, forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery, is known as systole, while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as diastole. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body. At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the ventricles are relaxing. As they do so, they are filled by blood passing through the open mitral and tricuspid valves. After the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria contract, forcing further blood into the ventricles and priming the pump. Next, the ventricles start to contract. As the pressure rises within the cavities of the ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valves are forced shut. As the pressure within the ventricles rises further, exceeding the pressure with the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open. Simultaneously, the atria refill as blood flows into the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Finally, when the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The ventricles start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the cycle begins again. The cardiac output is normalized to body size through body surface area and is called the cardiac index. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill: if the ventricles contract more frequently, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched. Afterload, or how much pressure the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract. The sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. When the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. Heart failure is the end result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with ischaemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or high blood pressure. Less common causes include various cardiomyopathies. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias. Cardiomyopathies \nCardiomyopathies are diseases affecting the muscle of the heart. Some cause abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart to abnormally expand and weaken (dilated cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart muscle to become stiff and unable to fully relax between contractions (restrictive cardiomyopathy) and some make the heart prone to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy). Many cardiomyopathies can lead to heart failure in the later stages of the disease. Valvular heart disease \nHealthy heart valves allow blood to flow easily in one direction, but prevent it from flowing in the other direction. Diseased heart valves may have a narrow opening and therefore restrict the flow of blood in the forward direction (referred to as a stenotic valve), or may allow blood to leak in the reverse direction (referred to as valvular regurgitation). In some parts of the world rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of valvular heart disease, typically leading to mitral or aortic stenosis and caused by the body's immune system reacting to a streptococcal throat infection. Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nWhile in the healthy heart, waves of electrical impulses originate in the sinus node before spreading to the rest of the atria, the atrioventricular node, and finally the ventricles (referred to as a normal sinus rhythm), this normal rhythm can be disrupted. Some types of arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation increase the long term risk of stroke. These arrhythmias can take many forms and can originate from different structures within the heart—some arise from the atria (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Other defects include those affecting the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis), or the main blood vessels that lead from the heart (e.g. coarctation of the aorta). More complex syndromes are seen that affect more than one part of the heart (e.g. Some congenital heart defects allow blood that is low in oxygen that would normally be returned to the lungs to instead be pumped back to the rest of the body. These are known as cyanotic congenital heart defects and are often more serious. Major congenital heart defects are often picked up in childhood, shortly after birth, or even before a child is born (e.g. transposition of the great arteries), causing breathlessness and a lower rate of growth. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as \"lub\". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. A different type of sound, a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together. As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart. Valvular heart disease \nDiseased heart valves that have become abnormally narrow or abnormally leaky may require surgery. In some arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation which increase the risk of stroke, this risk can be reduced using anticoagulants such as warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants. These devices monitor the heart, and if dangerous heart racing is detected can automatically deliver a shock to restore the heart to a normal rhythm. In some patients with heart failure, a specialised pacemaker known as cardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used to improve the heart's pumping efficiency. In very severe cases of heart failure, a small pump called a ventricular assist device may be implanted which supplements the heart's own pumping ability. In the most severe cases, a cardiac transplant may be considered. History\n\nAncient \n\nHumans have known about the heart since ancient times, although its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. Aristotle considered the heart to be the organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. He also discovered the heart valves. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart and created arterial blood. Pre-modern \nThe earliest descriptions of the coronary and pulmonary circulation systems can be found in the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon, published in 1242 by Ibn al-Nafis. In his manuscript, al-Nafis wrote that blood passes through the pulmonary circulation instead of moving from the right to the left ventricle as previously believed by Galen. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows from one side of the heart to the other via the lungs. Modern \n\nA breakthrough in understanding the flow of blood through the heart and body came with the publication of De Motu Cordis (1628) by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey's book completely describes the systemic circulation and the mechanical force of the heart, leading to an overhaul of the Galenic doctrines. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924. It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the Weighing of the Heart ceremony. The heart is associated with the small intestine, tongue, governs the six organs and five viscera, and belongs to fire in the five elements. Other animals\n\nVertebrates\nThe size of the heart varies among the different animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging from those of the smallest mice (12 mg) to the blue whale (600 kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies in the middle of the ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous, and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat, which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers—two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. There is a heart with three chambers: two atria and one ventricle. The ventricle is incompletely separated into two-halves by a wall (septum), with a considerable gap near the pulmonary artery and aortic openings. The exception to this rule is crocodiles, which have a four-chambered heart. In the heart of lungfish, the septum extends partway into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate. Full division \nArchosaurs (crocodilians and birds) and mammals show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. Fish\n\nFish have what is often described as a two-chambered heart, consisting of one atrium to receive blood and one ventricle to pump it. The atrium and ventricle are sometimes considered \"true chambers\", while the others are considered \"accessory chambers\". Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart, but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood from the body through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus, which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery). In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable. Invertebrates\n\nArthropods and most mollusks have an open circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood collects around the heart in cavities (sinuses). This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. Oxygen travels by diffusion and there are five small muscular vessels that connect these vessels that contract at the front of the animals that can be thought of as \"hearts\". The branchial hearts have two atria and one ventricle each, and pump to the gills, whereas the systemic heart pumps to the body. Only the chordates (including vertebrates) and the hemichordates have a central \"heart\", which is a vesicle formed from the thickening of the aorta and contracts to pump blood.

The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The left and right sides of the heart have different functions: the right side receives blood coming from the body through the superior and inferior venae cavae and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while the left side receives saturated blood from the lungs.\n\nQuestion: How many chambers has the heart?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Anterior compartment muscles of the thigh include sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles- rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis. Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity. These terms are often used after the particular muscle such as gluteus maximus, and gluteus minimus. It is responsible for the movement of the gluteus maximus in activities requiring the hip to extend the thigh, such as climbing stairs. Anatomy\nThe largest muscle of the posterior hip, gluteus maximus, is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve. It branches out and then enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus, the principal extensor of the thigh, and supplies it. Origin\n\nThe muscle is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve which arises from the dorsal branches of the ventral rami of the fifth (L5), the first (S1) and second (S2) sacral nerves. The sacral plexus is formed in the pelvis in front of the piriformis muscle. The sacral plexus is formed anterior to the piriformis muscle and gives rise to the sciatic nerve, the superior and inferior gluteal nerves, and the pudendal and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves. However, most of the sacral plexus nerves are scarcely recognizable, because they leave the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. From the pelvis, the anterior primary branches of the nerves entering the plexus (the first sacral nerve being a particularly large one) and a mass of nerves on the piriformis can be recognized. Course\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and runs underneath the piriformis muscle. It then divides into muscular branches to supply the gluteus maximus that pass posteriorly into the deep surface of the gluteus maximus muscle. It has been described as having multiple branches with subsequent innervation of the overlying gluteus maximus. At the lower border of the piriformis muscle, the nerve turns backward and divides into upward and downward diverging branches, which enter the gluteus maximus. The nerve may also send a branch to the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The inferior gluteal nerve reliably emerged inferior to the piriformis muscle. There were two to three divisions of the inferior gluteal nerve under the piriformis that would further divide close to the insertion of the nerve into the actual muscle belly. In all specimens, the nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus approximately 5 cm from the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur and entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus over the inferior one-third of the muscle belly. There is a relationship between the common stalk of the inferior gluteal nerve and external anatomic landmarks. This will result in maximal stimulation of the gluteus maximus musculature when using electrical stimulation for the purpose of prevention of pressure ulcers. The superior gluteal nerve passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen, above the piriformis: the inferior gluteal nerve also passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen but below the piriformis.\" Function\nThe major function of the gluteus maximus is to extend the flexed thigh and bring it inline with the trunk. The gluteus maximus, a large muscle with numerous attachments, is a powerful extensor of the thigh or of the trunk lower limbs are in a fixed position. It extends thigh at the hip, assists in laterally rotating the thigh. Surprisingly, however, the gluteus maximus is not important posturally, is relaxed when one is standing, and is little used in walking. In ten other patients who had a posterior approach, nine had abnormal electromyographic findings in inferior gluteal innervated muscles and eight of the ten also had abnormalities in superior gluteal innervated muscles. When a muscle-splitting incision is made across gluteus maximus as part of the classical posterior approach and the muscle parted by hand-held or self-retaining retractors, the likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is high. The nerve enters the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualised and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as the blood vessels. Parting the muscle damages the nerve further by stretching or even rupturing its branches which run superiorly on its deep surface. The posterior approach is the most common and practical of those used to expose the hip joint. This may cause selective denervation of the gluteus maximus since the inferior gluteal nerve courses along the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualized and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as blood vessels. When gluteus maximus is weak/injured, trunk extends (lean back) on heel-strike on weakened side. This compensates for weakness of hip extension. Damage to the inferior gluteal nerve causes loss of extension at hip, and causes the buttock to  waste. There is an apparent forward protrusion of the affected hip due to exaggerated hip motion and the person may also hold the shoulders backward to keep the center of gravity behind the joint. (Netter's Clinical Anatomy, 2010)\n\nThe piriformis muscle and the gluteus maximus muscle have different functions in the human musculature. The piriformis muscle is pear-shaped and lies deep to the gluteus medius muscle. On the other hand, the gluteus maximus muscle is the largest and most superficial muscle in the gluteal region. The fibers of the gluteus maximus run inferolaterally and attach distally to the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity of the femur. This muscle can extend the thigh from a flexed position when the pelvis is fixed, aid in strong lateral rotation of the thigh, and contribute to strong abduction at the hip. It also helps rotate the pelvis posteriorly on the femur heads when the thigh is stabilized. The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is important for stabilizing the femur on the tibia. In summary, the piriformis muscle is involved in gait and maintaining balance, while the gluteus maximus muscle is responsible for posture, thigh extension, lateral rotation, abduction, and stabilizing the femur on the tibia.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the large buttock and thigh muscle?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We know this because in order for a period to come regularly there are certain events that must occur in the ovary and uterus. First, several of the immature eggs present in the ovary at the beginning of the cycle will begin developing and growing. During the first 9 or 10 days of the cycle, one of the eggs is selected by the ovary to be the “dominant” egg that will eventually mature completely and be released. While it is maturing, the ovary produces estrogen which tells the brain that the ovary is working and also causes thickening of the uterine lining getting ready for implantation of a fertilized egg. Once this egg reaches maturity within its follicle (fluid filled cavity), a surge of hormones from the brain called LH (luteinizing hormone which can be measured by an ovulation predictor kit) causes release of the egg from its follicle. Once the egg is released, the now empty follicle is called a corpus luteum cyst and has the sole purpose of producing the hormone progesterone which acts as the glue keeping the uterine lining intact in preparation for an embryo implanting. The egg will then be picked up by one of the fallopian tubes and hopefully become fertilized by sperm in the tube and then travel into the uterus where it will implant into the thickened uterine wall. How Many Days Out of the Month is a Woman Fertile? After the monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Among these follicles, one will become dominant and continue its maturation process. When the dominant follicle is fully mature, LH triggers its release from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. The released egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus for potential fertilization. After ovulation, the follicle quickly transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation. Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After ovulation, several physiological changes occur in the female reproductive system. One significant change is the transformation of the ruptured follicle into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes hormones such as progesterone and estrogen, which play essential roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. This thickening prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. The ovulation process, which marks the release of an egg from the follicle, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). This surge induces the release of the mature egg, which then travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, potentially for fertilization. These physiological changes in the female reproductive system after ovulation are crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the preparation of the uterus for potential pregnancy. Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. These cells form the Atrioventricular node (or AV node), which is an area between the left atrium and the right ventricle within the atrial septum, will take over the pacemaker responsibility. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker. The left and right branches of this bundle, and the Purkinje fibers, will also produce a spontaneous action potential at a rate of 30-40 beats per minute, so if the SA and AV node both fail to function, \n\nThe rhythm of the heart's contractions is determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium of the heart. These pacemaker cells generate electrical impulses that stimulate the contraction of the heart muscle. The impulses from the SA node spread throughout the atria, causing them to contract, and then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, resulting in their contraction as well. In summary, the rhythm of the heart's contractions is primarily determined by the pacemaker cells in the SA node, which generate electrical impulses that regulate the coordinated contraction of the heart's chambers. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers are occasionally capable of acting as the default or \"escape\" pacemaker. The reason Purkinje cells do not normally control the heart rate is that they generate action potentials at a lower frequency than the AV or SA nodes. The part with the highest autonomy in the human body is the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the sinus node or the sinus pacemaker. From there, the signal is transmitted to the ventricles, leading to their contraction and pumping blood to the rest of the body. The SA node has its own intrinsic rhythm, independent of external signals.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. Either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (such as Lupron) may be used in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) using an infusion pump to simulate endogenous hormone production. This set of therapy is reserved for a subset of women with infertility and have produced ovulation rates of 90% and pregnancy rates of 80% or higher. They provide structural support, help in hormone production and release, and create a blood-testis barrier. In the male hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the maturation of Sertoli cells, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. After ovulation, the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum. The steroidogenic pathways in the ovaries involve the conversion of cholesterol to androgens, which are then converted to estrogen or progesterone. In the female hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. FSH promotes follicular development, while LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum. It thickens during the proliferative phase in response to estrogen stimulation and prepares for potential implantation. Each of these stages involves the interplay of multiple hormones. In the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are secreted pulsatively, stimulating the maturation of the ovarian follicle. The increase in estrogen and progesterone levels leads to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Hormones also play a crucial role in other stages of reproduction. During fetal development, sex determination occurs under the influence of hormone signaling. In conception, hormones such as LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After conception, various hormones including progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prolactin support the development of pregnancy, maintenance of the pregnancy, and initiation of lactation. Overall, hormones play a vital role in each stage of reproduction by regulating the development and function of reproductive organs, controlling the menstrual cycle, supporting pregnancy, and facilitating the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation and menopause. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads play crucial roles in regulating sex hormones. The hypothalamus, located in the brain, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the bloodstream. In response to GnRH, the pituitary gland releases two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an androgen hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics. FSH, on the other hand, promotes the production of sperm by stimulating the cells in the testes called Sertoli cells. Together, testosterone and sperm production are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in males. The follicles then produce estrogen, which is responsible for the development of female sexual characteristics.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal and aquatic plant growth. Approaches for prevention and reversal of eutrophication include: minimizing point source pollution from sewage, and minimizing nutrient pollution from agriculture and other nonpoint pollution sources. This can have several negative effects on downstream water bodies, including:\n\n1.

One major concern is the erosion of topsoil. Additionally, surface runoff can carry agricultural fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can contribute to water pollution, leading to eutrophication (excessive nutrient enrichment) and harmful algal blooms. Moreover, surface runoff may transport sediment and other pollutants such as bacteria or pathogens from livestock waste into streams, rivers, or lakes. These include contour plowing, strip cropping, cover crops, and buffer zones along water bodies. These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality. Overall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.

At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties. In order to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo \"length contraction\" by a factor of in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory. In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\" cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?\" In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light. James Clerk Maxwell developed a model to explain electric and magnetic phenomena using the aether, a model that led to what are now called Maxwell's equations and the understanding that light is an electromagnetic wave.\n\nQuestion: What name was given to the invisible material once thought to occupy all space?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location. These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine-structure \n\n If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). According to the cosmological principle, the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model. Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations. Michael Rowan-Robinson emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: \"It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.\" On their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's \"fine-tuned\" physical constants, as the current universe \"selects\" only those past histories that led to the present conditions.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the theory that the universe appears the same wherever and whenever viewed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features. Their orbits would be dynamically unstable, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon. so, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred. As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.\n\nQuestion: From which areas of space can there be no escape?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31′ for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7–13′; Thalassa, 8–14′; Despina, 14–22′; Galatea, 13–18′; Larissa, 10–14′; Proteus, 12–16′; Triton, 26–28′. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's largest outer satellite, Nereid, is not large \n\n The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. It has a higher density than the geologically dead Rhea, the largest inner moon, but lower than that of active Enceladus. All together, they form a satellite system which is called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus.\n\nQuestion: Proteus and Nereid are moons of which planet?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction. It is believed that the distance from Earth to the centre of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc.

These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction.

It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It is important to note that while \"relativity\" primarily refers to these two theories by Einstein, there is also Galilean relativity, which predates them. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity.

Its apparent angular diameter is about 1 degree. The light of the supernova explosion reached Earth approximately 3700 years ago. Although it overlaps the Vela Supernova Remnant, it is four times more distant. It is approximately 2.9 kpc from Earth. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would at least engulf the orbit of Jupiter. It is currently moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −21 km/s, and will come within 44.58 pc in about 685,000 years ago. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.\n\n Psi Capricorni, Latinized from ψ Capricorni, is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Capricornus. The distance to this star is approximately 47.9 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +20 km/s. The closest approach to the Sun occurred some 467,000 years ago at a separation of 6.003 pc.\n\nQuestion: Which star is as bright as 23 Suns, and is orbited by the Pup?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected. Cyan   is the color between green and blue on the visible spectrum of light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength between 490 and 520 nm, between the wavelengths of green and blue. In the subtractive color system, or CMYK color model, which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta and yellow. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from grey. Colors in the cyan color range are teal, turquoise, electric blue, aquamarine, and others described as blue-green. spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. In the traditional subtractive color model used in painting and printing, the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by blending or mixing other colors together.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting point are the lowest among all the elements. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and in \n\n Argon is a chemical element with the symbol Ar and atomic number 18. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust. Nearly all of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. Helium-4 is created by radiogenic production (by decay of uranium/thorium-series elements). An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. One of the most well-known properties of helium is its low density. This gas is lighter than air, which enables objects to float in air when filled with helium. This property makes helium useful for filling balloons and airships. It remains a gas, even at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. In terms of its chemical properties, helium is an unreactive element and is considered inert. It does not readily form compounds with other elements, which is why it is often referred to as a noble gas.\n\nQuestion: What is the second lightest chemical element?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Had the shell struck 10 Downing Street itself, it is likely the entire cabinet would have been killed. Bomb-proof netting on the windows of the cabinet office muffled the force of the explosion, which scorched the back wall of the building, smashed windows and made a crater several feet deep in the garden. In January 2020, the government began hosting lobby briefings at 9 Downing Street instead of the traditional location in the House of Commons. That year the building began undergoing a £2.6-million refurbishment in preparation for televised press briefings to be held. The Downing Street Press Briefing Room is located in No. 9, the first press conferences were held by Boris Johnson in March 2021. Downing Street is a street in central Cambridge, England. The building was previously part of the more famous 10 Downing Street, which has been the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury since 1732.

Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the \"true toads\". Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live \n\nPost-metamorphic changes in activity metabolism of anuran species, such as frogs and toads, are influenced by several factors, particularly in relation to their life histories. On the other hand, species like Rana clamitans (green frogs) spend longer periods as larvae (3-10 months) and weigh more (3 g) at metamorphosis. Species like Rana palustris (pickerel frogs) fall between wood frogs and green frogs in terms of larval duration and size at metamorphosis. The smaller body sizes of newly metamorphosed toads and wood frogs impose limitations on their behaviors. In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. The oxygen transport mechanisms between larval and adult amphibians differ in several key aspects. This is in contrast to terrestrial amphibians, which rely on lungs for gas exchange. Secondly, larval and adult amphibians have different hemoglobin compositions. No globin chains are shared between larval and adult amphibians. Adult amphibians generally have higher hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes (PCVs) compared to larval forms. Metamorphosis in newts and salamanders may not result in a transition in hemoglobin affinity like in frogs and toads. However, when newts and salamanders switch from aquatic to aerobic respiration at metamorphosis, both larval and adult hemoglobins exhibit the same affinity for oxygen. Lastly, toads, which primarily rely on aerobic respiration, tend to have higher hemoglobin and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations and lower blood oxygen affinity compared to frogs, which primarily rely on anaerobic respiration. These differences in oxygen transport mechanisms reflect the varying physiological adaptations amphibians undergo during their life cycle and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. A true toad is any member of the family Bufonidae, in the order Anura (frogs and toads). This is the only family of anurans in which all members are known as toads, although some may be called frogs (such as harlequin frogs).\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a frog and a toad?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends. The traditional European domino set consists of 28 tiles, also known as pieces, bones, rocks, stones, men, cards or just dominoes, \n\n of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common set historically is double-six, though in more recent times \"extended\" sets such as double-nine have been introduced to increase the number of dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a game. Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles. Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four \n\n Domino, also known as Card Dominoes, Spoof, Sevens, Fan Tan (US) or Parliament (UK), is a card game of the Eights group for 3–7 players in which players aim to shed cards by matching the preceding ones or, if unable, must draw from the stock. The game is won by the player who is first to empty their hand. However, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are \"extended\" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots,\n\nQuestion: How many pieces are there in a standard set of dominoes?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its mission is \"\"Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters\". Although the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with \n\n The policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \"tantamount to abduction\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\". Instead, the National Police Foundation conducts and translates scientific research, training, technical assistance and evaluation to advance policing. Based at Bryn in Oslo and established in 1959, it is a national unit that works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assisting unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, and is responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. It is subordinate to the National Police Directorate.\n\nQuestion: What is the acronym for the agency which provides co-operation between police forces worldwide?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1973, Dr. Joseph Kerwin was the first U.S. physician selected for astronaut training, serving as the Science Pilot for the Skylab2 mission to the first U.S. orbital space station. Like Dr. Kerwin, when physicians have flown, they have served as scientists, engineers, spacewalkers, and project managers. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata performs an ultrasound scan using the Human Research Facility (HRF) Ultrasound2 on Expedition 38. Surprisingly, few serious medical emergencies in space have been reported. While documented conditions have included urosepsis, renal colic, cellulitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmia, only 17 of these nonfatal severe medical events have been reported during spaceflight between 1961-1999.1 The relatively benign nature of medical problems in space flight is likely due to shorter missions, selection of healthy astronauts, on-board medications, and countermeasures to environmental effects and prolonged microgravity.2 The comprehensive profiling process includes an evaluation of astronauts' physiological and psychosocial well-being, medical history, and extensive laboratory and genetic markers. Mae Jemison, MD, (a general practitioner) floats in zero gravity at the Spacelab Japan Science module aboard STS-105, Endeavour. For example, one study estimates that the risk of an emergency medical event during a 7-member space flight to Mars would be about 1 emergency event per trip. This may seem negligible until put in the context of a 6-month return to Earth.1,3 Thus, the capability to administer advanced care for illness and injury will undoubtedly be a prerequisite for interplanetary travel and prolonged human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.2 Additionally, as space vehicles move further from Earth's orbit, telemetric medical support and traditional communication traveling at the speed of light will have a longer delay (eg, in the case of Mars, two-way radio contact will require a minimum of 44 minutes).2 Given such delays, the current practice of relying on Earth-based medical consultation and a crew medical officer without extensive medical training may no longer be enough. Other medical events unique to space also must be anticipated, particularly higher incidence of space radiation, injuries from increased extravehicular activities, space debris, and increased susceptibility for infection. Astronaut Luca Parmitano collects fundoscopic images with the help of astronaut Chris Cassidy for the Ocular Health experiment. Future space travelers are unlikely to be as fit and healthy as past astronauts, adding to the likelihood of increased medical incidents in space. Despite these restrictions, the space tourist will be less healthy and less equipped to handle emergencies than previous space travelers who spent years preparing for a mission. Only 5 EM-trained American physician-astronauts have flown in space: Thomas Marshburn, MD; Anna Fisher, MD; William Hendrick Fisher, MD; Scott Parazynski, MD; and Kjell Lindgren, MD.4 The emergency medicine training experience has many qualities that make emergency physicians the best potential medical providers for the future of human space flight: comfort with rapid assessment and treatment, resuscitation expertise, ability to perform a wide range of advanced procedures, exposure to diverse pathologies, and creativity in resource limited settings.

The Victoria line was built to give as many interchanges as possible with Underground and British Rail lines, with, wherever possible, cross-platform connection between different lines heading in the same direction. Former train operating company Anglia Railways ran services known as London Crosslink \n\n The Central London Rail Study of 1989 proposed standard (British Rail) structure gauge tunnels linking the existing rail network as the \"East–West Crossrail\", \"City Crossrail\", and \"North–South Crossrail\" schemes. The east–west scheme was for a line from Liverpool Street to Paddington/Marylebone with two connections at its western end linking the tunnel to the Great Western Main Line and the Metropolitan line on the Underground. The report also recommended a number of other schemes including a \"Thameslink Metro\" route enhancement, and the Chelsea–Hackney line. Its opening changed the local area from a gentrified London suburb to industrial, with several works and units opening around Ferry Lane to the northwest. The Victoria line station opened on 1 September 1968. The station was re-sited by British Rail on 14 December 1981, to provide better interchange with the Underground station. A second entrance at the east end includes the main Victoria line ticket hall, and is accessed via subways on each side of High Road just north of the junction with Seven Sisters Road. The section of Victoria line between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park stations is the longest between adjacent stations in deep level tunnels on the London Underground network.\n\nQuestion: On the London Underground, which is the only line to connect at some point with every other line on the system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Zimmer recalled in 2001 that the video drew criticism from some viewers who watched it before it aired on MTV, due to being \"'too violent' because we blew up a television.\" The video is best known as marking the debut of MTV, when the US channel started broadcasting at 12:01 AM on 1 August 1981. On 27 February 2000, it became the one-millionth video to be aired on MTV. It also opened MTV Classic in the UK and Ireland. The video marked the closing of MTV Philippines before its shutdown on 15 February 2010 at 11:49 PM. MTV co-founder Bob Pittman said the video \"made an aspirational statement. We didn't expect to be competitive with radio, but it was certainly a sea-change kind of video.\" The video also premiered as the 'New Joint' on BET's 106 & Park on March 20, 2008. The video first began receiving airplay in early May 1999, debuting on U.S. television channels MTV, MTV2 and The Box.

Interwoven in their storylines are two romance-stricken ladies, each possessing an unusual allegiance to the manliness of the name Ernest. His friend, Algernon Moncrieff, is of moderate means and has also created an imaginary character, Bunbury. Vermine in turn notes that Sir Humphrey himself wronged Brookall in a more personal way, seducing, impregnating, and then abandoning the man's sister. They go to Roscullen, where Doyle was born, to develop some land.

In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). Edison had chosen a carbonized (burned) \n\n filament for his new lamp, but this solution was not perfect. Hammer's discovery was first called \"Hammer's Phantom Shadow,\" but when Edison patented the electric light bulb in 1883 this thermionic emission became known as the \"Edison Effect,\" and was patented on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031). While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; \"to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development.\" Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask.\n\nQuestion: Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is a specific phobia that can cause significant distress and impair an individual's daily functioning. People with thanatophobia often have an overwhelming fear of their own death or the death of loved ones. This fear may be triggered by thoughts of dying, witnessing death, or being in situations related to mortality, such as hospitals or funerals. Symptoms of thanatophobia can vary from person to person but may include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, nausea, and a sense of impending doom. The exact causes of thanatophobia are not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a near-death experience, may also contribute to the development of this phobia. They can offer a personalized treatment approach and support to address the impact of thanatophobia on an individual's life. teeth).

Acrophobia is a common phobia and can have a significant impact on a person's daily life. Additionally, acrophobia can also cause physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom or panic attack. Traumatic experiences or accidents involving heights can contribute to the development of this phobia. Treatment for acrophobia often includes a combination of therapy techniques. In conclusion, acrophobia is an intense and irrational fear of heights that can significantly impact a person's life.

Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms. Writing a lipogram may be a trivial task when avoiding uncommon letters like Z, J, Q, or X, but it is much more challenging to avoid common letters like E, T, or A in the English language, as the author must omit many ordinary words. Grammatically meaningful and smooth-flowing lipograms can be difficult to compose. Examples are the characters æ and œ used in English and French, in which the letters 'a' and 'e' are joined for the first ligature and the letters 'o' and 'e' are joined for the second ligature. For stylistic and legibility reasons, 'f' and 'i' are often merged to create 'ﬁ' (where the tittle on the 'i' merges with the hood of the 'f'); the same is true of 's' and 't' to create 'ﬆ'. The common ampersand (&) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters 'e' and 't' (spelling et, Latin for 'and') were combined. Because of its ubiquity, it is generally no longer considered a ligature, but a logogram.

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24. On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful \n\n , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite.

The names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and Z, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as Y Graeca \"Greek Y\" (pronounced I Graeca \"Greek I\") and zeta (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term zed for Z in all forms of English other than American English. Over time names sometimes shifted or were added, as in double U for W (\"double V\" \n\n The name was adopted into the Irish language most likely from Jean, the French variant of the Hebrew name Yohanan. As Gaelic has no letter J (a consonant derived from the vowel I that has not been adopted into all languages that use the Latin alphabet; English also lacked the J until the latter 17th Century, with John having previously been spelt Iohn), an S was substituted, as was the normal Gaelic practice in adapting Biblical names that in other languages contain J (Sine/Siobhàn for Joan/Jane/Anne/Anna; Seonaid/Sinéad for Janet; Seumas/Séamus for James; Seosamh/Seòsaidh for Joseph, and so on).

(The world's first live televised sporting event had been the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. ) On 30 September 1939, the first American football game, a college contest between Fordham and Waynesburg \n\n On September7, 1979, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 30,000 viewers tuned in to witness the launch of ESPN. Simultaneously, ESPN debuted its first SportsCenter telecast with anchors Lee Leonard and George Grande. The first show featured a complete game between basketball's Harlem Globetrotters and their foils at that time, the Baltimore Rockets. The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history. NBC broadcast the game on station W2XBS with one camera and Bill Stern was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just one month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised sporting event. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game.\n\nQuestion: In 1931, what became the first ever televised sports event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. The song was the first commercial single release to feature the group's original lineup since Geri Halliwell left in 1998. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it a \"classic\" from the group, while others \n\n As part of Virgin's strategy to make the group an international act, \"Wannabe\" was released in Japan and Southeast Asia two weeks before its British release. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as Space Shower. \"Wannabe\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number three, six days after its physical release, with sales \n\n As the Spice Girls' debut single, \"Wannabe\" has been credited for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in \"Spicemania\" in the late 1990s. Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band.\n\nQuestion: What was the Spice Girls' debut single called?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Flat is the opposite of sharp, which is a raising of pitch. In musical notation, flat means \"lower in pitch by one semitone (half step)\", notated using the symbol which is derived from a stylised lowercase 'b'. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. In intonation, flat can also mean \"slightly lower in pitch\" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is \"flat\" with respect to the other. Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called theoretical keys: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted). There does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures: \n\n way in flats and in another way using sharps. After C comes the key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A). temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the top of the circle, the notes change by descending fifths and the key signatures change accordingly: the key of F has one flat, the key of B has 2 flats, and so\n\nQuestion: What are the only two musical notes which have no flats?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words). Potatoes entered the German cuisine in the late 17th century, and were almost ubiquitous in the 19th century and since. French fries, called Pommes frites, Pommes (spoken as \"Pom fritz\" or, respectively, \"Pommes\", deviating from the French pronunciation which would be \"Pom freet\" or \"Pom\") or regionally as Fritten in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either ketchup or mayonnaise, or, as Pommes rot/weiß (lit. fries red/white), with both. Also common are dumplings (including Klöße as the term in the north or Knödel as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including Schupfnudeln, which are similar to Italian gnocchi. In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (Paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch (from \"Hungarian\")) and salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s.\n\nQuestion: From which country do French fries originate?

An arrangement often found in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half the total number of floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; for example a lift of a 24-storey building would only stop at 12 levels, with staircases used to access the \"upper\" or \"lower\" level from each intermediate landing.\n\nQuestion: A man lives on the 20th floor of a block of flats. If it is a rainy day, he gets into the elevator in the morning, goes down to the ground floor and goes off to work. In the afternoon when he comes home, he gets into the elevator and goes straight to the 20th floor.

In 2014, there were nearly 70,000 people self-identifying as \"Siamese\" or \"Thai\" who held Malaysian nationality. This number excludes the senior citizen Siamese who live in Malaysia but do not hold Malaysian citizenship because of political constraint. Sovannaphum means \"golden land\" in Khmer and is written as Suwannabhumi in Thai. The name refers to mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian language of Pali. The first provinces were named mueang (เมือง, township) as those developed from the historical city-states. There were both mueang directly dependent from Bangkok (thus similar to the modern province), as well as mueang under the supervision of a more powerful neighbouring mueang, or part of the semi-independent tributary states. In 1906 the transition to the term changwat started, which was finalised in 1916. Both Sisaket and Surin had Khmer-speaking percentages of over 25.0% in both 1990 and 2000, with Surin even having a Khmer-speaking majority of over 60.0% in 1990, albeit with it falling just short of a Khmer-speaking majority in 2000. Although Portugal's overseas influence gradually declined from the 17th century, it maintained ties with Siam. In contrast to other European powers, against whose colonial aspirations Siam struggled during the 19th century, Siam's relationship with Portugal was largely friendly.

Its strategic importance dates back to a Roman era fortress and Frankish count's castle site in the Early Middle Ages. While Luxembourgers are fluent in all three of their official languages, German, French and Luxembourgish, most also have a good working knowledge of English. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the European Development Pole in the cross-border area of Longwy in France, Rodange in Luxembourg and Athus in Belgium. The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing.

However, fearing loss of influence over the left bank of the Rhine, France \n\n Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to annex Luxembourg into its empire.

They wrote the song “Regret” for R&B singer LeToya Luckett featuring Ludacris, which also peaked at #78 on the U.S. \"There's the Girl\" is a song recorded by the American rock band, Heart. It was composed by Holly Knight and Heart band member Nancy Wilson. Knight is known as a very successful songwriter who was responsible for penning many hit singles during the 1980s. Like Heart's 1986 #1 single \"These Dreams\", the lead vocals on \"There's the Girl\" were performed by Nancy Wilson, rather than Ann Wilson, the usual lead singer for the group (though most fans did not realize this until the video was released or they saw the song performed live). The song made appearances in late 1987 episodes of the daytime soap operas All My Children and The Young and the Restless. \"Valentine\" is a song co-written and performed by American recording artist Jim Brickman, with a guest vocal from Martina McBride.\n\nQuestion: Who had a top ten hit in 1988 with Valentine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. The distal end of the femur, or thigh bone, has several important features that contribute to its function in the skeletal structure. This head forms part of the hip joint, connecting with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. The angled neck of the femur allows for efficient weight-bearing and distribution of forces during movements such as walking or running. The trochanter serves as an attachment point for various muscles of the hip, including the gluteal muscles. The hip is located where the top of the femur bone, or thighbone, fits into the pelvis. The femur bone is the longest bone in the body, extending from the knee to the hip. At the top of the femur bone is the greater trochanter, that boney knob that people often refer to as their hip, and the bulbous \"femoral head\" which makes contact with the pelvis and forms the ball of the ball and socket joint. The femoral head fits into the acetabulum, the round socket of the pelvic bone. Both the femoral head and the acetabulum are lined with articular cartilage. When the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum, the articular cartilage allows the two surfaces to glide against each other. A strong piece of cartilage, called the labrum, rings the outer edge of the acetabulum. The labrum deepens the socket joint, making the joint more stable, but its elasticity allows for flexibility. Over time the smooth articular cartilage that makes up the surfaces of the hip joint may be damaged or blemished by normal wear and tear or from trauma. The hip has several ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvis and tendons connecting the bones to many surrounding muscles. Strong and flexible ligaments and tendons provide structure to the hip, reducing strain on the joint, so most hip osteoarthritis therapies will including stretching and strengthening of these structures. When the hip is at rest, the synovial fluid is stored in the cartilage, much like water in a sponge. When the hip rotates or bears weight the synovial fluid is squeezed out. Small sacs of synovial fluid, called bursae (singular is \"bursa\") surround all major joints, including the hip joint. When the hip joint becomes inflamed and painful, the pain may be felt in the groin but may also be referred into the back, buttocks and down the front or back of the leg. In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is advantageous in surgeons, but the degree of ambidexterity found among them varies greatly. From wielding a club to threading a needle, our hands enable us to engage in both rough motor skills and fine motor skills. One crucial function of the hands is their ability to provide tactile feedback. In terms of handedness, each hand is predominantly controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain. This means that individuals have a preferred hand choice for single-handed activities like writing or using utensils. Handedness is determined by genetic factors and reflects an individual trait. It's important to note that while handedness is common, it is not universal. Some individuals may be ambidextrous, meaning they can use both hands equally well for various tasks. Overall, the human hands play a vital role in our daily lives by enabling us to interact with our environment and experience the world through touch. ambidextrous /am′bēdek″strəs/ [L, ambo, both, dexter, right] ,able to use either the left or right hand to perform a task and write.ambi-, ambo-, amb-,prefixes meaning \"on both sides\" or \"both\": ambidextrous, ambomalleal.See also ochre mutation, opal mutation.amastia /əmas″tē·ə/ [Gk, a, mastos, not breast] ,the absence of the breasts in women caused by a congenital defect, an endocrine disorder resulting in faulty development, a lack of development of secondary sex characteristics, or a bilateral mastectomy. −amaurotic, adj.

Studies have shown that most people, regardless of handedness, use their dominant hand for tasks that require accuracy. In a study conducted in Korea, it was found that only 6% of participants were left-handed and 8% were ambidextrous. The majority of participants were right-handed or ambidextrous individuals who used their right hand for tasks requiring accuracy. Reference:\n- Hand dominance and hand use behavior reported in a survey of 2437... (Jung)\n- Hand dominance and implications for left-handed operation of controls (Garonzik)\n\n Organizational ambidexterity refers to an organization's ability to be efficient in its management of today's business and also adaptable for coping with tomorrow's changing demand. Just as being ambidextrous means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both exploration and exploitation techniques to be successful.\n\nQuestion: What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a rollout phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves. Then a third card is revealed, followed by a betting round, a fourth card, a betting round, and finally a showdown. This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at high-low split, in which case it is called \"Skinny Minnie\". However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, \n\n single-deck games better for counters. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Haggis is a shedding card game similar to Tichu, Zheng Fen, and other East Asian climbing games. Haggis has received praise for being the first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start for two to three players, where most previous games required four players or more. The evenly distributed, face card \"bombs\" are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game. The game's designer, Sean Ross, developed Haggis over a period of several years, with first publication in late 2010 by Indie Boards and Cards. The game was named after haggis partly in a nod to Ross' Scottish heritage, but also because the game brought together the \"guts\" (scoring and play mechanisms) of several other climbing games. Haggis was a nominee for \"Best Card Game\" in the 2010 Golden Geek Awards by BoardGameGeek.\n\nQuestion: With which game would you use a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51 mm?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students. Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s, with no author identified for the new lyrics, nor credit given for the melody from \"Good Morning to You\". Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company, and a series of court cases (which all settled out of court), the sisters became known as the authors of \"Happy Birthday to You\". One of the first was made by Dan W. Quinn for Berliner Gramophone in 1895, which is the same year the song was first published. Mildred Jane Hill, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the oldest of three sisters, Mildred, Patty, and Jessica. She learned music from her father, Calvin Cody, and Adolph Weidig. It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher, like her younger sister Patty. Hill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Mildred Hill's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nQuestion: The melody for which famous song was written by sisters and school teachers Patty and Mildred Hill in Kentucky in 1893?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names. Pub names are used to identify and differentiate traditional drinking establishments. Many pubs (public houses) are centuries old, and were named at a time when most of their customers were illiterate, but could recognise pub signs. British pubs may be named after and depict anything from everyday (particularly agricultural) objects, to sovereigns, aristocrats and landowners (shown by their coats of arms). Other names come from historic events, livery companies, occupations, sports, and craftsmen's guilds.

Fleet had previously played one of Kevin's teachers in a sketch from series 2 of Harry Enfield and Chums set at a parents evening. In both series of Harry Enfield's Television Programme, when Kevin was \"Little Brother\", his mother was played by Caroline Quentin and his father was played by Martyn Whitby. As a teenager, Kevin's mother (named Sheila in one of the earlier sketches) was played by Louisa Rix in both series of Harry Enfield and Chums and in Kevin & Perry Go Large. Kevin's father, named Dave in one of the earlier sketches, and later Frank as well as Rick or Ray in the film, has been played by three actors:\n\n Kevin originated in 1990 in the \"Little Brother\" sketches of Harry Enfield's Television Programme as an annoyingly energetic young boy who constantly vexed his older brother with his irritating catchphrases and habit of bursting into his room when he was with a girl, to bother their activities. The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. Unlike the previous sketches which included an older brother, this incarnation of Kevin is implied to be an only child. The family harmony was strained when Kevin found out that Kitty was going to work for a senator (Rob Lowe) who had voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In the process, Kevin realized Kitty herself was opposed to gay marriage, although she supported civil unions. His best friend is another teenage boy named Perry Carter (played by the actress Kathy Burke, and based on an early character Burke portrayed on various Channel 4 shows).

In genetics, a palindrome refers to a DNA sequence that reads the same way forward and backward. Kaibun (回文; literally circle sentence) is a Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. The unit of kaibun is mora, since the Japanese language uses syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Single word palindromes are not uncommon in Japanese. For example, Ku-ku (九九, multiplication table), Shi-n-bu-n-shi (新聞紙, newspaper), to-ma-to (トマト, tomato), etc. So kaibun usually refers to a palindromic sentence, but a passage can be a kaibun too. In classics, diacritic marks are often ignored. Rather than saying \"read the same forwards and backwards\", because Japanese is traditionally written vertically, Japanese people describe the word as being the same when read from the top (ue kara yomu) as when read from the bottom (shita kara yomu). Secondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences. Furthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine. In addition, the ambigraphic notation supports the derivation of ambiguity characters, which are symbols used to represent multiple possible nucleotides at a given position in a genetic sequence. yātayā tarasā cārustanayānaghayā śritaṃ The 34th stanza is the 33rd stanza written backwards, with a different meaning. Finally, the 27th stanza is an example of what has been called \"the most complex and exquisite type of palindrome ever invented\". It may also be thought of as a syllabic Sator Square. Sanskrit aestheticians call it sarvatobhadra, \"perfect in every direction\" — it yields the same text if read forwards, backwards, down, or up: सकारनानारकास- कायसाददसायका । रसाहवा वाहसार- नादवाददवादना ॥ sakāranānārakāsa- kāyasādadasāyakā rasāhavā vāhasāra- nādavādadavādanā.\n\nQuestion: What seven letter word, beginning with the letters 'Ra' is a palindrome?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On 13 March 2020 all SPFL leagues were indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. On 8 April 2020, the SPFL proposed to end the 2019&ndash;20 season by utilising a points per game ratio to determine the final standings. The plan was approved on 15 April 2020, declaring that the season was over, as Dundee United were declared title winners with Partick Thistle relegated to League One. The SPFL has 42 member clubs and is split into four divisions; the Premiership (12 clubs), the Championship (10), League One (10), and League Two (10).

Two regular strands involved a series of different women making dating agency videos about their general likes and dislikes, and a musical parody that would close the show. Originally \"Spot the Pony\", it was changed at Kevin Lygo's suggestion to \"Smack the Pony\" which some people mistakenly assumed was some kind of sexual euphemism. In Germany, the first transmission of the show aired on ProSieben, where the theme tune was changed to Texas' 2001 version of \"I Don't Want a Lover\", and featured a different title sequence. Deliberately silly and avoiding repetitive catchphrases, the show's surreal humour proved popular and the series had a regular audience of around 2.5 million viewers in the UK. & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \"Ain't No Pleasing You\". However, their song \"Margate\" was used in a feature-length episode of the series entitled \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\" in 1989. They also created the theme tune and incidental music for the children television show Bangers and Mash, and recorded the title theme for Crackerjack! The song gained mass public exposure when it was selected by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash to be the theme tune to their sitcom The Royle Family. Although it had modest beginnings, the series soon became popular and its theme became well known. The opening credits of the series edited together the first stanza of the first verse and the second stanza of the first chorus. The end credits, which would cut in immediately after the final joke of the episode – so as to add weight to it – began with the second stanza of the final chorus and would see the song through to the coda.\n\nQuestion: The theme tune to which TV show starts with the line Stick a pony in me pocket?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Play stops immediately, and the serve must be redone. The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred. Lets occur more often on first serves, as the server is more cautious on the success of a second serve. This is in stark contrast to lawn tennis, where players alternately serve and receive entire games. In real tennis the service can only change during a game, and it is not uncommon to see a player serve for several consecutive games till a chase be made. Indeed, in theory, an entire match could be played with no change of service, the \n\n the point. Unintentional interference results in a \"let\"&mdash;the point is replayed.\n\nQuestion: What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, this symbolism is rejected by Ulster unionists, as illustrated by an exchange in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1951: -James McSparran (Nationalist Party): The tricolour is admitted by all nations within the comity of nations to be the national flag of Ireland. It is the national flag of the Irish Republic. It is also used for the Ireland international rules football team, selected by the GAA on an all-island basis. The red in the flag stands for the revolutionary zeal of the youth and the sky blue symbolises their desire for peace. The red star stands for revolutionary idealism and honesty and the five corners of the star represent the solidarity and friendship of the youth of all five continents. Within the canton features a Lion of Saint Mark against a background of diagonal red, white, and green stripes. By including the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice, the insurrectionists simultaneously demonstrated continuity with the previous republic alongside newfound independence. The usage of a green-white-red tricolour as the basis of the flag was also significant insofar as it signified greater links between the Republic and the wider Italian independence movement. The change from blue to green started in the 17th century with Owen Roe O'Neill and Confederate Ireland, The colour green became associated with Ireland from the 1640s onwards. This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is the same as the modern Flag of Leinster. Green is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the \"Emerald Isle\". The color is particularly identified with the republican and nationalist traditions in modern times. It is used this way on the flag of the Republic of Ireland, in balance with white and the Protestant orange.\n\nQuestion: Which three colours appear on the flag of the Republic of Ireland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was the first series in Australia to gain an international cult following, particularly in the United States and Canada (as Prisoner: Cell Block H). The series was so popular in the United States, in Los Angeles, it was the second-highest-rated show after Charlies Angels and was the second-highest rating programme at KTLA-5 amongst 65 primetime programmes transmitted through \n\n Prisoner was created by Reg Watson, who had produced the British soap opera Crossroads from 1964 to 1973 and would create Australian soaps The Young Doctors, Sons and Daughters and Neighbours. Inspired by the British television drama Within These Walls, the show was initially conceived as a 16-episode series, with a pilot episode bearing the working title \"Women Behind Bars\". Its storylines focused on the lives of the prisoners and, to a lesser extent, the officers and other prison staff. \"First Blood\" saw the introduction of Kate Jenkinson's character Allie Novak, former prison Governor Joan (Pamela Rabe) returning as an inmate and the beginning of a rivalry between central character Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) and Kaz Proctor (Tammy Macintosh). The episode also includes scenes set outside the prison, which follow Franky Doyle (Nicole da Silva), a former inmate who is released on parole. The Prisoner is a 17-episode British television series broadcast in the UK from 29 September 1967 to 1 February 1968. Starring and co-created by Patrick McGoohan, it combined spy fiction with elements of science fiction, allegory, and psychological drama. The producer of The X-Files called The Prisoner \"the Gone with the Wind of its genre.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Without The Prisoner, we'd never have had cryptic, mindbending TV series like Twin Peaks or Lost.

The painting of him was done in oil on a mahogany panel, and measures 46 x 34 in (116.8 x 87.3 cm). Rienk Jelgerhuis (13 April 1729 – 17 April 1806) was a Dutch painter, engraver and draftsman. Jelgerhuis was born in Leeuwarden. He taught his son, Johannes Jelgerhuis, who became an accomplished painter, illustrator and actor. Rienk Jelgerhuis died in Amsterdam.

Koninck was born in Amsterdam, the son of a goldsmith, originally from Antwerp, and was a nephew of Philips de Koninck. He moved in the circles of Rembrandt and the academy of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, making many copies of Rembrandt's compositions. Perhaps one of the better known of these is the Philosopher with an Open Book at the Louvre that was long attributed to Rembrandt and served as companion piece to Rembrandt's Philosopher in Meditation.

An official version of the beer is sold in three variations near the Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios. In 2015, 20th Century Fox, producer of The Simpsons, began selling licensed Duff beer in Chile, with a view to driving out brandjacking. Contreras designed the bottle to be identical to the one portrayed on The Simpsons. The bottle can be seen at his website. The beer is currently available at a few bars, but Contreras has stated his intention of selling it at convenience stores and even exporting it to the United States. This case has been featured on several Mexican newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the novelty the beer represents, rather than the legal implications of it. of Rainier beer in Baker Lake, Washington. ; In the A&E 2012 television series Longmire, the series' main character Sheriff Walt Longmire exclusively drinks Rainier beer, and can be seen drinking it throughout the series. In the pilot episode, a colleague accuses \n\n of drunk driving after empty beer cans are found in his car; Longmire explains the presence of the empty beer cans by saying \"Every man who's ever had a beer with me will tell you the same thing—I drink Rainier, always have, always will. 1 on the list of top 100 beers by Cold Cans. The product was ordered to be pulled from store shelves and destroyed, because of the likely association in public mind between the Simpsons brand and characters and Lion Nathan's product, though the manufacturer did not use any Simpsons characters or the Simpsons Duff Beer design.

From heart disease and strokes to certain types of cancer, here’s why your blood type matters. Unless you’ve recently given blood, you may not think much about your blood type. The presence or absence of certain molecules called A or B antigens, as well as a protein called the Rh factor, determine which of the eight common blood types you have coursing through your veins. However, these antigens make a difference beyond just your blood, influencing other body systems like your blood vessels, nerve cells, and blood platelets—which is why your blood type may impact your risk of certain diseases. Here’s why you should know what blood type you have. Non-O blood types have 25 to 30 percent higher levels of blood clotting proteins known as von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Considering that type Os have lower quantities of the proteins that help blood coagulate, they’re also less likely to suffer from blood clots. (The downside is that blood clotting helps prevent excessive bleeding.) “It shouldn’t be assumed that being an O blood type means an individual is ‘protected’ or an A blood type is at higher risk,” says American Society of Hematology Councillor Terry B. Gernsheimer, MD. O may be the most common blood type, but it can interfere with pregnancy. Another interesting finding from the BMC Medicine study: Non-O blood types (A, B, or AB) also had an increased risk of gastric cancers, possibly due to an inflammatory response to H. pylori bacteria, the researchers write. (The bacteria is a cause of gastric ulcers.) Because of differences in clotting, A/B blood types are 31 percent more likely to suffer from venous thromboembolism—a clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin, or arm—compared to the O type, according to research from the University of Minnesota. Though AB is the least common blood type, research suggests that people with AB are 82 percent more likely to develop cognitive issues in the future. It may be because this blood type comes along with higher levels of factor VIII, the study authors say. People with A or B blood type have up to 21 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, per Diabetologia. (B positive had the highest odds.) While researchers note that it’s not exactly known why, one thought is that it may be that blood type influences the GI microbiome, which can affect glucose metabolism and inflammation. Another study found that although following the diet may work, it has nothing to do with someone’s specific blood type. There’s a theory that your blood type can explain why you act the way you do. While that largely hasn’t been proven, one Japanese study found that some traits differed between blood groups. Keep in mind that the research linking blood type and health conditions looks at population studies, so it can only find an association—not that your blood type is the cause. “The risk for any one person is multifactorial,” notes Dr. Gernsheimer. Your blood type certainly doesn’t seal your fate when it comes to your health. Even though there are many ways your blood type can influence your health, “there isn’t good evidence that one’s lifestyle should be altered because of it,” says Dr. Gernsheimer. And it’s not up to you to have this info should you need a blood transfusion, she says. For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History\n\nDiscovery\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Classification systems\n\nCzech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. Other developments\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. Genetics \n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group. These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:\n\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations. Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. Clinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells. In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn. Clinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Alteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002. Another approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.

In addition, another large GWAS study has associated ABO-histo blood groups as well as FUT2 secretor status with the presence in the intestinal microbiome of specific bacterial species. Alteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002. Another approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies. For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History\n\nDiscovery\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Classification systems\n\nCzech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. Other developments\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. Genetics \n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group. These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:\n\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations. Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. Clinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells. In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn. Clinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. In addition, another large GWAS study has associated ABO-histo blood groups as well as FUT2 secretor status with the presence in the intestinal microbiome of specific bacterial species.

He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting Christopher Wright \n\n Ambrose Rookwood (c. 1578 – 31 January 1606) was a member of the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot, a conspiracy to replace the Protestant King James I with a Catholic sovereign. He married the Catholic Elizabeth Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons. He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by Robert Catesby, a religious zealot whose impatience with James' treatment of English Catholics had grown so \n\n admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.\n\nQuestion: Which King did Guy Fawkes attempt to kill with his gunpowder plot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Victims, former prosecutors, and the retired Palm Beach police chief were among those quoted criticizing the agreement and Acosta's role in it. He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. Early life \nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. Pre-Arizona criminal history \nHarding's first arrest occurred when he was 11 years old, when he was arrested for joyriding. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. Harding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder. Harding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension. Harding's crime spree began with the attempted robbery of a prostitute in Chicago, Illinois, on September 27; on December 10, he robbed and murdered Stanton Winston Blanton in Dallas, Texas, although he was never charged with this murder. On December 18, he robbed a man named Ronald Svetgoff and stole his car and identification cards, the latter of which he would use to feign his identity when he relocated to Arizona. On January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Arizona murders \nOn January 24, 1980, Harding fled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he gained entry to a hotel room belonging to 38-year-old gastroenterologist Allen F. Gage. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth. On January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. He had missing teeth and jaw fractures from when Harding had bludgeoned him with the lamp, and Harding had shot him point-blank with a .25 caliber pistol once in the chest and once in the left temple. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him. Apprehension \nAfter this encounter, Harding drove the stolen car to a reserved parking lot on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The campus police officer then followed Harding, arrested him, and searched him, finding a .25 caliber pistol in one of his pockets, an identification card reading \"Security Guard,\" another identification card reading \"Special Officer,\" a Texas driver's license issued to a man named Ronald Gene Svetgoff, and an Oklahoma driver's license issued to the same man. At the time of his capture, the FBI office in Flagstaff announced that Harding was wanted for investigation in connection with a total of five murders, six kidnappings, 12 armed robberies, and four carjackings across Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Tennessee, and Texas. Harding was subsequently charged with the murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, and he was booked into the jail in Coconino County, Arizona. In October 1980, Harding assaulted a fellow jail inmate, leading to him being charged with Dangerous or Deadly Assault by Prisoner. Harding chose to serve as his own counsel in this trial; a court also appointed a public defender to help Harding. Due to these threats, Harding was required to be restrained in leg irons during his trial. Sometime later, Harding was transferred to the Pima County Jail, where, in February, he attacked two guards. During Harding’s trial, deputy sheriffs cordoned off the first two rows of the courtroom’s viewing gallery to prevent Harding from being able to take a hostage. Harding was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, as well as the armed robberies and kidnappings of both men and the theft of Concannon’s car. On May 26, 1982, Harding's sentencing hearing took place. The board ultimately refused to recommend that then-Governor Fife Symington grant mercy in the form of a reprieve or commutation to life imprisonment. Martin Concannon's widow elected not to view the execution, but Warden Roger Crist, then-Attorney General Grant Woods, Harding's religious advisor, and six reporters were witnesses. When the chamber was sealed, a curtain was lifted to allow witnesses to look at Harding; Attorney General Woods claimed that Harding then looked at him and began yelling obscenities through the glass. Harding was the first person executed in Arizona after the death penalty moratorium imposed by the 1972 Furman v. Georgia ruling was lifted, and he was the first in the state since the 1963 gas chamber execution of Manuel Silvas. To date, he is the most recent person to be executed by cyanide gas in a gas chamber in the United States. The New York Times and Newsweek claimed Attorney General Woods became ill and vomited at the sight of Harding's convulsions.

Varacalli's crew was responsible for the theft of about 600 auto airbags. In 2002, Varacalli was sentenced to 10 years in prison and received a $1 million fine. He was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Otisville, New York. On December 21, 2009 Varacalli was released from prison. Donald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 – April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber and spree killer who was convicted of the January 25, 1980 murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon. He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. Early life \nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. Pre-Arizona criminal history \nHarding's first arrest occurred when he was 11 years old, when he was arrested for joyriding. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. Harding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder.

Bow hair is traditionally horsehair, though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back and increase the tension of the hair. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is \n\n The sound producing technique is also a little different from the modern violin technique. A scroll, mogra, is also tied to the instrument tail. The bow is wooden and bears a curved flourish at one end which is made of metal. In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells.

Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates. Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Common amongst eusocial bees, females make up the worker and queen populations. As a social species, Apis cerana colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age.\n\nQuestion: What is the name given to the largest bee in a hive?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

George Karslidis was born in 1901 in Chadik, Tsalka, Georgia. St. George after was born in 576 AD in a branch of the Sasanian royal family. In hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. His memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. England, Ethiopia, Georgia, Catalonia and Aragon in Spain, Moscow in Russia, and several other states, regions, cities, universities, professions and organizations claim George as their patron. St. George stands in lavishly decorated armour, and appears relaxed and nonchalant, raising his helmet and left hand to introduce van der Paele.

Treloar comments that the personification increases the emotional impact, and that the Ringwraiths (Nazgûl) are introduced \"as terror inspiring horsemen who bring these four evils into the world.

After more than three months of extensive research, Cheney recommended John Danforth to be the nominee, as the other choices' strengths were offset by liberal stances. Bush heavily considered Danforth, but ultimately asked Cheney himself to be the nominee. By picking Cheney, Bush had a running mate who had years of experience as well as an extensive foreign policy expertise. At the selection announcement, Bush said that Cheney, who had worked under all five presidential administrations between 1969 and 1993, was qualified, respected and shared his vision for America. On July 25, 2000, former Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney was chosen as his running mate. A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming.

In a prologue to Shadow in the Cloud, an animated training film from the United States Army Air Forces depicts the havoc a gremlin can produce for the unwary or complacent airman during wartime. When the film continues, the gremlin—a metaphor for problems caused by inattention and/or negligence—is depicted as a living, malevolent creature. If the player has spent too much time killing gremlins, this often makes it impossible for Felix to go back for the oil in time. There is a warning 'flicker' as the oil reaches a low level but unless Felix is already on the conveyor belt with a can of oil, it will be too late. If Felix successfully tops up the generator with oil, the gremlins regenerate (and sometimes increase in number) and play begins again. A gremlin is a mischievous folkloric creature that causes malfunctions in aircraft or other machinery. Depictions of these creatures vary. Since World War II, different fantastical creatures have been referred to as gremlins, bearing varying degrees of resemblance to the originals. The term \"gremlin\", denoting a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft, originates in Royal Air Force (RAF) slang among the British pilots stationed in Malta, the Middle East, and India in the 1920s, with the earliest recorded printed use being in a poem published in the journal Aeroplane in Malta on 10 April 1929. Set in 1920s Shanghai, East China, Secrets of the Mogwai will tell the story of how 10-year-old Sam Wing met Gizmo, a young Mogwai.\n\nQuestion: According to the film Gremlins, if you are looking after a Gremlin you should not feed him after midnight, not get him wet and not expose him to what?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the island Canaria contained \"vast multitudes of dogs of very large size\". It is considered that the aborigines of Gran Canaria called themselves \"Canarios\". The name of the islands is not derived from the canary bird; rather, the birds are named after the islands. It was called cuervo marino (\"sea raven\") on Fuerteventura, grajo de mar (\"sea chough\" ) on Lanzarote, and corvino (\"little raven\") on Graciosa. In addition, the local name lapero (\"limpet-eater\") was also used, possibly on Alegranza. The Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis) is a Macaronesian endemic bat, and Canary big-eared bat (Plecotus teneriffae) is a Canary Islands endemic. The Canary Islands oystercatcher has had a complicated taxonomic history. Calicut, where Europeans first obtained it; Calico cat and calico horse derive from the appearance of their mottled coat suggesting calico cloth ; canary — a small yellow bird, originating on and named after the Canary Islands, specifically the largest island, Gran Canaria, called in Latin Insula Canaria, \"island of dogs\", after the wild native dogs found there ; Capri pants — mid-calf pants named for the Italian isle of Capri, where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s.\n\nQuestion: The Canary Islands are named after what animal?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition to \"Layla\", she was the inspiration for Clapton's love songs \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\". He also wrote \"Golden Ring\" for Boyd, in response to her sadness at learning of Harrison's marriage to Olivia Arias in 1978, and the 1983 track \"The Shape You're In\", which addressed Boyd's drinking.

He finished with 5,994 points in nine events, beating runner-up Joshua Williamson by 186 points. At the time, Detroit police officer Watson said, \"I sure am sorry to miss the decathlon, because I think I could have won it again.\" The title of \"World's Greatest Athlete\" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. That title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since. The first world record in the decathlon was recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1922. The current world record holder in the decathlon is French national Kevin Mayer. Over the years athletes have become bigger, stronger, and faster; in turn athletes scored more points leading to the world record where it stands now at 9126 points by the current world record holder Kevin Mayer. ; Decathlon Bill Toomey's World Decathlon best in the 400 metres, 45.6 (45.68 FAT) lasted almost 47 years until it was beaten by Ashton Eaton while setting the world record in 2015. ; Men's 4x100 Relay record was set three times in Mexico City, including both semi-finals and the final by the 🇺🇸 which lasted until the next Olympics ; Men's 4x400 Relay record by the 🇺🇸 lasted almost 24 years (although it was equalled after 20 years).

A year later, in 1948, Falkenburg reached the pinnacle of his tennis career by winning the Wimbledon singles championship. He won the acclaimed tennis crown, after winning 3 of 5 sets against Australian John Bromwich. Bromwich had a match point at 5–3 in the fifth set, but Falkenburg saved three match points and went on to win 7–5 in the fifth set. It took 71 years before Falkenburg's feat was repeated. At Wimbledon in 2019, Novak Djokovic fought off Roger Federer by saving two championship points in the fifth and final set to win the men's title for the fifth time. Fellow tennis player Tom Brown, who was a runner up in the 1947 Wimbledon Championships described Falkenburg's competitive approach, \"He would review the situation, figure out what was likely, and take chances.\" This match was historic as it saw Federer equal Björn Borg's open-era record of five consecutive Wimbledon Championships. Due to this potential Borg returned to the All England Club for the first time in many years to witness the Wimbledon final. The victory also equalled Federer with Borg and Rod Laver with 11 Grand Slam championships, leaving him only three behind Pete Sampras in his quest to achieve the all-time record. Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title). None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982). Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have a storied rivalry that many consider to be the greatest in tennis history. The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd.\n\nQuestion: Peter Simple, Jack Horner and Ben Nevis have all won which famous sporting event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

İstanbul has chosen the second most congested and the most sudden-stopping traffic in the world. Travel times in Turkey's largest city take on average 55 percent longer than they should, even in relatively less busy hours. As the ninth most visited city in the world and the ninth most popular congress destination in the world, Istanbul is also the location for a number of international hotel chains, hosting, as of September 2015, 106 operating international chain hotels, with further 31 such hotels scheduled to open before late 2017. In 2013, Istanbul was selected the best holiday destination in Europe.

The Beatles would secure a fourth Christmas number-one single in 1967 with \"Hello Goodbye\". As of 2021, The Beatles remain the act with the most Christmas number-one singles in the United Kingdom. This achievement made the Spice Girls the first act in UK chart history to have its first four singles reach number one, breaking the record set by Gerry & The Pacemakers, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, and Robson & Jerome with three number ones each. Amazingly, despite charting for 31 years, this was only Elton's 5th UK No. They both released their singles in Christmas week and the girls beat the boys to the top spot, claiming the Christmas number one with their debut single, \"Sound of the Underground\".

Questions are multiple choice and contestants choose between a possible four answers, sometimes with the aid of lifelines. Guaranteed safe levels, where the contestant is guaranteed this amount of money to take home, regardless of any subsequent questions they may get wrong, are in bold. The contestants' run ends when they either answer a question incorrectly, decide to not answer a question and walk away with their prize money, or if they answer all 15 questions correctly (winning $1 million). In 2004, Philbin returned to host 12 episodes of a spin-off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $10,000,000. As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000. Contestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip (see Lifelines).

It depicts Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, who befriended Russell after meeting him at Fernand Cormon's atelier in Paris, which they both attended. It is the earliest of three portraits painted of Van Gogh from life by his contemporaries, the other two being Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887) and Paul Gauguin's The Painter of Sunflowers (1888). The painting passed from Van Gogh to his brother Theo, then to their family, and is now in the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Seine (paintings) is the subject and location of paintings that Vincent van Gogh made in 1887. Here van Gogh primarily captures the respite and relief from city life found in nature. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as cousin-in-law Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School. In Paris van Gogh was exposed to and influenced by Impressionism, Symbolism, Pointillism, and Japanese woodblock print genres which were overtime integrated into his works. Van Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as Harvest at La Crau. This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.

The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its \n\nOne of the most vital minerals for detoxifying the body is potassium, and there is no better source than raw apple cider vinegar.Only vinegar with the \"mother\" can be used as medicine because it has beneficial minerals (especially potassium), malic and tartaric acids, and enzymes intact.Raw vinegars have been used to cure ailments for centuries, not only for specific medical problems, but also to improve one's health, to detoxify the body, and to treat a wide range of diseases related to toxins and acidity. In Asia, vinegar is often called \"the best friend of Chinese herbs\" because it is frequently used to process herbal preparations. The historical origins of vinegar are not exactly known; it was probably discovered when our ancestors saw that wine exposed to the air turned sour, thereby creating vinegar. In the culinary arts, vinegar is primarily used as a flavorful and acidic cooking ingredient. It adds tanginess and brightness to dishes and can be used in marinades, dressings, sauces, and soups. Balsamic vinegar, for example, is made from grape must and is known for its rich flavor and syrupy consistency. Malt vinegar is made from malted barley and has a distinctive malty taste. Overall, vinegar's versatility makes it a valuable ingredient both in cooking and various industrial settings. Vincotto appears to be related to defrutum and other forms of grape juice boiled down to varying strengths (carenum, sapa) that were produced in Ancient Rome. Defrutum was used to preserve, sweeten, and/or flavor many foods (including wine), by itself or with honey or garum. It is made from either rice or sake lees. These vinegars are used in making sunomono (酢の物, \"vinegar dishes\"), tsukemono (漬物, \"pickles\"), nimono (煮物, \"simmered dishes\"), as well as in marinades to mitigate the stronger odors of certain fishes and meats.\n\nQuestion: Which English word comes from an old French word meaning sour wine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Gestation lasts around two months (63 days). Weaning takes place between 45 and 60 days, with the young reaching full maturity around one year of age. Gestation lasts roughly six months, ending in parturition, which normally occurs during June or July. Typically, females give birth to one or two young. The newborns weigh about 500 g, and have spots. The young are cared for by their mother after birth for several months, until weaning occurs. At six months, the young have typically reached full adult size. Sexual maturity, however, does not occur until roughly 18 months. Females are generally the main caretakers, as they watch their young for roughly 3 to 4 months. The gestation period is about 11 months. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do \n\n The uterine horns open into the vagina through separate vaginal canals, forming a uterus duplex.

Water is the most important part of the beaver habitat. Beavers also prefer wider streams over narrower ones. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Their infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other organisms in the ecosystem, they are considered a keystone species. Beavers hold territories and mark them using scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum, a \n\n to protect the overall diversity of a landscape. Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. It has been hypothesized that beavers' canals are not only transportation routes but an extension of their \"central place\" around the lodge and/or food cache. Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the home of a beaver?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Pilbara ningaui is considered to be of similar size and weight. The males compete for females during the breeding season. Females sexually mature at 17 months while males mature at around 20 months. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male western grey kangaroo. At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother. As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets.

His first book was his autobiography The Sport of Queens (1957); he was offered the aid of a ghostwriter but rejected the idea. The book's success led to his becoming the racing correspondent for London's Sunday Express newspaper, and he continued in that job for 16 years.

The group's two previous Christmas chart-toppers were 1963's \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and 1964's \"I Feel Fine\". Only two other acts have achieved three consecutive Christmas number-one singles; The Spice Girls and LadBaby. The Beatles would secure a fourth Christmas number-one single in 1967 with \"Hello Goodbye\". As of 2021, The Beatles remain the act with the most Christmas number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The Beatles, The Dave Clark Five, Dusty Springfield, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1963. The 1962 Christmas number-one, \"Return to Sender\" by Elvis Presley, remained at number one for the first week of 1963. The first new number-one single of the year was \"The Next Time\"/\"Bachelor Boy\" by Cliff Richard and The Shadows. Overall, seventeen different singles peaked at number-one in 1963, with The Beatles and Gerry and the Pacemakers (3) having the joint most singles hit that position. According to the most recent record album certifications, the holiday album title that has shipped the most copies in the United States is Elvis Presley's 1957  LP Elvis' Christmas \n\n The song was the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart, but was beaten by the relatively unknown Gary Jules and Michael Andrews with a cover of Tears for Fears' \"Mad World\", and thus the band had to settle for the number two position, joining a list of acts including Wham!, The Pogues, Mariah Carey and Cliff Richard to miss out on the top spot (though Cliff did make number one with differing releases too). He holds the record, with Presley, as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s–2000s).\n\nQuestion: Which act has had more Christmas number one singles than any other?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times.

Indeed, when the Krays were arrested for the Cornell murder (two years after the fact), they were drinking (at 6 a.m.) at The Lion pub, Bethnal Green, intending to move on later to the Astor.

She was married to Majors from 1973 to 1982, although the couple separated in 1979. Throughout her marriage (and despite the separation) she used the name Farrah Fawcett-Majors in her screen credits. In 1979, Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O'Neal, and they had a son named Redmond James Fawcett O'Neal, who was born in 1985. In 1994, Fawcett told TV Guide that their relationship had some troubles. Fawcett ended the relationship after she caught him in bed with actress Leslie Stefanson in 1997.

One distinguishing feature is the presence of mammary glands, which are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk. This milk serves as the primary source of nutrition for the offspring. Another unique characteristic of placental mammals is the presence of hair or fur, which helps protect them against extreme cold. Placental mammals also have a middle ear that contains three bones, allowing them to transmit sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Unlike other vertebrates, placental mammals have a lower jaw consisting of only a single bone on each side. Additionally, placental mammals are warm-blooded (endothermic) and have specialized or differentiated teeth. They possess a larger brain, particularly the neocortex, which is the most advanced brain area. Placental mammals also have a diaphragm, a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity, and an efficient four-chambered heart. It is worth noting that humans, as primates, are classified as placental mammals. These unique characteristics collectively contribute to the successful adaptation and diversity of placental mammals. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796).The first true mammals made their appearance some 200 million years ago and, over the course of tens of millions of years, diverged into three branches: The monotremes are egg-laying mammals, such as the duckbilled platypus, found only in Australia and New Guinea. Kangaroos and opossums are marsupials, found in Australia and the Americas, in which the newborn continue to develop outside the womb in a marsupium (pouch). Ninety percent of all mammals are placental (eutherians), in which the fetus is carried in the womb until birth at which time it is at an advanced stage of development. Humans are placental mammals classified as **primates**. Mammals have a number of unique characteristics not shared by other vertebrates: Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk, the offspring's primary source of nutrition. (In 1758, Linnaeus named these animals _mammals_ , from the Latin = \"breast.\") Hair or fur, present at some time during life, protects mammals against extreme cold. Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). This 1937 poster promoted infant nursing.Since then, the practice has increased, and experts recommend it for at least the first six months of infant life.# Birds\n\n**Charles Darwin** (1809–1882)\n\n# c. 150 Million BCE\n\nThere are some 10,000 species of living birds on all continents that have the common characteristics of being feathered, winged, bipedal, warm-blooded, and egg-laying. Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk. In most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function. Oxytocin is critical for the milk let-down reflex in response to suckling. Due to lactation, the mother-young pair can survive even if food is scarce or too hard for the young to attain, expanding the environmental conditions the species can withstand. The costly investment of energy and resources into milk is outweighed by the benefit to offspring survival. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring. After birth, oxytocin contracts the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly produced milk into the duct system. It is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy through combinations of birth control pills, galactagogues, and milk expression using a breast pump. Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Suckling by the baby stimulates the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which signals to the posterior pituitary gland to produce oxytocin. Milk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the milk ejection or let-down reflex. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region. If this is true then milk simply enters the lactiferous ducts), and then out the nipple. Without pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation\nIn humans, induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in some cultures, and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers. It appears plausible that the possibility of lactation in women (or females of other species) who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage, especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds. The phenomenon has been also observed in most primates, in some lemurs, and in dwarf mongooses. Rare accounts of male lactation (as distinct from galactorrhea) exist in historical medical and anthropological literature, although the phenomenon has not been confirmed by more recent literature. Evolution \n\nCharles Darwin recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands, and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in brood pouches of fish, where they would provide nourishment for eggs. The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids. As all mammals lactate, lactation must have evolved before the last common ancestor of all mammals, which places it at a minimum in the Middle or Late Triassic when monotremes diverged from therians. O. T. Oftedal has argued that therapsids evolved a proto-lacteal fluid in order to keep eggs moist, an adaption necessitated due to diapsids parchment shelled eggs which are more vulnerable to evaporation and dehydration than the mineralized eggs produced by some sauropsids. This protolacteal fluid became a complex, nutrient-rich milk which then allowed a decline in egg size by reducing the dependence on a large yolk in the egg. [20] The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth. During early evolution of lactation, the secretion of milk was through pilosebaceous glands on mammary patches, analogous to the areola, and hairs on this patch transported the nourishing fluids to the hatchlings as is seen in monotremes. The development of the nipple occurred in the mammal lineages that diverged after monotremes, metatheria and eutheria. Occurrence outside Mammalia\n\nAnother well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of columbiform birds. Like in mammals, this also appears to be directed by prolactin. A closer examination reveals that, as in mammals and birds, the secretion of this nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin. Lactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tsetse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus. Blocking nursing immediately after birth resulted in complete mortality of the offspring, whereas blocking it 20 days after birth resulted in increased foraging and reduced survival. This form of lactation may have evolved from production of trophic eggs.

The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids. As all mammals lactate, lactation must have evolved before the last common ancestor of all mammals, which places it at a minimum in the Middle or Late Triassic when monotremes diverged from therians. O. T. Oftedal has argued that therapsids evolved a proto-lacteal fluid in order to keep eggs moist, an adaption necessitated due to diapsids parchment shelled eggs which are more vulnerable to evaporation and dehydration than the mineralized eggs produced by some sauropsids. This protolacteal fluid became a complex, nutrient-rich milk which then allowed a decline in egg size by reducing the dependence on a large yolk in the egg. [20] The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth. During early evolution of lactation, the secretion of milk was through pilosebaceous glands on mammary patches, analogous to the areola, and hairs on this patch transported the nourishing fluids to the hatchlings as is seen in monotremes. The development of the nipple occurred in the mammal lineages that diverged after monotremes, metatheria and eutheria. Occurrence outside Mammalia\n\nAnother well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of columbiform birds. Like in mammals, this also appears to be directed by prolactin. A closer examination reveals that, as in mammals and birds, the secretion of this nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin. Lactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tsetse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus. Blocking nursing immediately after birth resulted in complete mortality of the offspring, whereas blocking it 20 days after birth resulted in increased foraging and reduced survival. This form of lactation may have evolved from production of trophic eggs.

Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.\n\nQuestion: Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail. Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry. Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works \n\n material written by Mário. To pass the time, he writes letters to his mother and daydreams about the beautiful Isabelle. One day, he discovers that the girlfriend of one of his clients is Ilaria, a girl that Giulio loved at school. Inside Giulio, the old flame is rekindled; however, Ilaria is about to marry a man much older than her. When she sends Giulio an email, asking him to meet, he discovers that the passion is mutual and the two become lovers. The emotional response of Giulio's parents, combined with the fact that Ilaria is ready to give up her impending marriage for him, send Giulio into a state chaos. Chile's most famous contributions to literature have come from Nobel Prize poets Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral, whose homes and birthplaces are now museums that attract literary pilgrims to Chile. José Donoso's novel Curfew recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while Antonio Skármeta's novel Burning Patience (drawing on Neruda's life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, Il Postino (The Postman).\n\nQuestion: To which poet does Il Postino deliver mail?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Despite the general public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist's dream come true\". Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. Furthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. Internationally, Lorentz served as the president of the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. His leadership in this role helped foster intellectual collaboration between nations. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time, expressed that Lorentz meant more to him personally than anyone else he had met in his life. In society, he played a prominent role in advancing physics through the Solvay conferences and held important positions both nationally and internationally. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous.\n\nQuestion: Which scientist was Time magazine's \"Person of the 20th Century\"?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the largest Chinese border city, facing Sinuiju, North Korea across the Yalu River, which demarcates the Sino-North Korean border. Dandong has therefore had a dynamic history because of its strategic location for the northeast's rich natural resources and because of its convenient access to the ocean. The Yellow Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean located between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula, and can be considered the northwestern part of the East China Sea. The innermost bay of northwestern Yellow Sea is called the Bohai Sea (previously Pechihli Bay or Chihli Bay), into which flow some of the most important rivers of northern China, such as the Yellow River (through Shandong province and its capital Jinan), the Hai River (through Beijing and Tianjin) and the Liao River (through Liaoning province). The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River. The peninsula is located in Northeast Asia, between China and Japan. To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia. The Yellow Sea lies to the west, the East China Sea and Korea Strait to the south, and the Sea of Japan to the east. At 223,179 km2, the area of Korea is similar to the area of the United Kingdom (244,100 km2) or \n\n Along the northern border with China runs the Yalu River and the Tumen River. In between the rivers, and the source of both, is Paektu Mountain, revered by both the Koreans and Manchurians as the mythic origin of each people. The worst hunger of the 1990s famine years occurred in these three provinces, and most refugees into China come from the Rust Belt region.\n\nQuestion: The Yalu river forms a sort of natural border between China and which of its neighbours?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The remaining contestants stand at a line of podiums, each equipped with a button, and are offered a cash buyout to quit the game ($2,500 on the first challenge, $5,000 on the second, $7,500 on the third). Total Wipeout is a British game show, hosted by Richard Hammond and Amanda Byram, which first aired on the BBC on 3 January 2009. In the summer of 2020, Top Gear presenters Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness hosted a six-episode best-of series, featuring the presenters narrating classic episodes of the show, called Total Wipeout: Freddie and Paddy Takeover. In the championship round, the reigning champion and the surviving contestant competed to become the first to identify a famous person. Six pictures of a celebrity were concealed onstage, ranging from childhood through maturity, and each was revealed one at a time with an accompanying musical clue. A contestant had to correctly name the tune and identify the celebrity pictured to win the game and return on the next episode. For the first picture only, after providing a correct title to the tune, a contestant was given ten seconds to ponder their guess before verbally attempting to identify the celebrity. In September 1956, the Jack Barry-hosted game show Twenty-One premiered on NBC, its first show being played legitimately with no manipulation of the game by the producers at all. That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer Dan Enright, \"a dismal failure\", as the two contestants were so lacking in the required knowledge that they answered a large number of the questions incorrectly.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Albert Einstein: Albert Einstein &ndash; deceased German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory. However, this was challenged in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which described light as discrete and localized quanta of energy (now called photons), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

Both Ariel and the slightly larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious. All of Uranus's moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The moon is also designated Uranus I.\n\n Oberon was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; on the same day he discovered Uranus's largest moon, Titania. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope. All of the moons of Uranus are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.

Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The satellite appears neutral (grey) in visible light (colour indices B-V=0.80, R-V=0.39), similar to Setebos but different from Sycorax (which is light red). It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties.

Many episodes see RoboCop's reputation put to the test or soured by interventions from Dr. McNamara, the creator of ED-260, the upgradable version of the Enforcement Droid Series 209 and the top competitor for the financial backing of OCP. He continually develops other mechanical menaces that threaten RoboCop. In this futuristic setting there is only one known city left in the world, and it is run by ChaoSonic. It was a justified outcome, but the cops want to protect their own, and Faith, along with the entire Atlanta police force, are resentful of the man responsible, GBI agent Will Trent.

RoboCop's human consciousness (Alex Murphy) waits for decades in hiding deep within Skynet's \"consciousness\", avoiding detection as the slaughter of humanity takes place. A human assault allows Murphy to create a Terminator body that resembles his old form.\n\nQuestion: Who was part man, part machine, all cop and hailed from a futuristic Detroit?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016. George Nolfi, who co-wrote the screenplay for the Bourne Ultimatum film, was to write the screenplay for a fourth film. On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date. It is preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. The Bourne Legacy is a 2004 spy fiction thriller written by Eric Van Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis. The Bourne Identity is a 1980 spy fiction thriller by Robert Ludlum that tells the story of Jason Bourne, a man with remarkable survival abilities who has retrograde amnesia, and must seek to discover his true identity. It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”). In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \"hands\" and \"feet\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs).

It is most commonly seen in larger dog breeds. Lipomas: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that are quite common in older dogs. It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other procedures and conditions related to dogs. If you have any concerns about your dog's health, it's best to consult with a veterinarian for a thorough examination and proper diagnosis. However, it could also simply mean that the dog isn't receiving enough calories. Consult your veterinarian. Professional (surgical) removal of the dewclaw is often the best course of action. Doggy Breath: May indicate gum disease, severe plaque buildup, or a number of other dental disorders. Consult your veterinarian about particularly large hot spots.Apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Skin Irritation: Cleanse area, remove the causative agent, and apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Superficial Cuts and Scrapes: Cleanse the area with mild soap and water.Baby wipes work well.Apply triple antibiotic ointment twice daily. can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe.

Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable. Cable ties were first invented by Thomas & Betts, an electrical company, in 1958 under the brand name Ty-Rap. Initially they were designed for airplane wire harnesses. The original design used a metal tooth, and these can still be obtained. Manufacturers later changed to the nylon/plastic design. Ty-Rap cable tie inventor, Maurus C.

Rooney was later nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, but lost to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas. Many pundits had tipped Everton for relegation that season: having escaped relegation from the Premier League by six points the previous season, Everton's task to stay in English football's top flight only seemed harder after the multimillion-pound transfer of teenage striker Wayne Rooney to Manchester United after setting the summer's European Championships alight. Everton kept pace with the likes of Chelsea (95pts) and Arsenal (83pts) at the Premier League summit for the first half of the season, finishing 2004 only a few points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Striker Niall Quinn and wingers David Rocastle and Martin Hayes both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. The consequent corner broke to Rooney on the edge of the penalty area, but his shot was deflected behind for another corner, which Scholes took. The England midfielder floated the ball over to the edge of the penalty area, where Rooney was waiting, only to volley it just over the bar. In the closing stages of the first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball trickling along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably.

Conan Doyle published The Sign of Four in 1890, which established Sherlock Holmes as a prominent character and did wonders in putting Conan Doyle on the map literature map in the United Kingdom and United States. In the year Conan Doyle published The Great Shadow, His wife, Louisa, gave birth to a son named Kingsley. Conan Doyle calls this \"the chief event' of their life. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste. Cheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle's highly popular stories as an adolescent. This style began China's interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle's style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. Black adds that Christie's work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges. The Big Four, the characters, are positioned as the hidden cause and connecting threat between the world-wide unrest, labour disputes, and the revolutions of the period—in particular, the October Revolution, with \n\n The Big Four is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by William Collins & Sons on 27 January 1927 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. This is a tale of international intrigue and espionage, therefore opening up the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie.\n\nQuestion: The Sign Of Four was a detective story written by which author?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She authored several popular sentimental and melodramatic novels during the 1890s, including Cross Currents (1891), probably her best known work, A Mere Cypher (1893), A Valiant Ignorance (1894), and Prisoners of Silence (1895). These were illustrated by Harold Copping. A 1911 copy of her Children's Stories from Dickens, from a limited edition of 500 copies signed by herself and four other granddaughters of Charles Dickens, was owned by Eleanor Roosevelt. By the early 1900s her sensationalist style of writing had fallen out of fashion, and by about 1916 she had stopped writing. However, her children's books based on the works of her grandfather continued to be popular. Dickens began by writing seventeen episodes, which were printed in All the Year Round between 28 January and 13 October 1860 and these were published in a single edition in 1861. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875.

The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-European Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Eastern Europe via the Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian rivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad, Belgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman. It flows through Poland's largest cities, including Kraków, Sandomierz, Warsaw, Płock, Włocławek, Toruń, Bydgoszcz, Świecie, Grudziądz, Tczew and Gdańsk. The river is often associated with Polish culture, history and national identity. It is the country's most important waterway and natural symbol, and the term \"Vistula Land\" (kraj nad Wisłą) can be synonymous with Poland. The river Rhine, which runs south–north through Western Germany, is an exception. Southwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube – and their respective floodplains. The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine (\"peri- Pannonian states\").\n\nQuestion: The River Danube runs through which three European capital cities?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While all of these activities are fun, Dr. John Cho, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Straub Medical Center, shares some knowledge on how to prevent and treat common water-induced ear diagnoses like surfer’s ear, swimmer’s ear and perforated ear drums. Wear customized ear plugs in the water. Visit an ear, nose and throat specialist for periodic cleaning. This combination encourages bony developments to grow in the ear, therefore restricting the ear canal. Wetsuits do not protect the ears. Wear swim caps or neoprene hoods in the water. A perforated ear drum can happen in water sports when traumatic forces act upon the ear. For example, if an ear is slapped by a wave, the pressure could cause the ear drum to rupture, which makes it more susceptible to infection. However, having an ear, nose and throat specialist monitor the status of the ruptured ear drum is extremely important to ensure the ear is healing properly. It is beneficial in certain type of ear problems such as tinitis, glue ear, middle ear infections. If a person wants to perform nasal cleansing, he can do it over a sink, on a bowl on a table, inside the shower. The temperature of water has to be suitable for pouring in the nose. To check the temperature pour a bit on your arm or taste it and then spit to check its temperature. Place the nose cone in the right nostril, and sealing it after a few twists and slight pressure. Put the spout straight up in the line with the nasal passage so that the tip of the nozzle will not get blocked inside the nose. At this time, do not sniff, laugh, talk, swallow or do not have any kind of movement through the nose while water is flowing through it. Now slowly bend in front from the waist so that the tip of the nose will become the lowest point of the head; slightly tilt the head to the right, so that left nostril will become the lowest point of the nose. Tilt slowly so that water will not come out of the top onto your face. Keep the cone of the neti vessel fully sealed into the right nostril so that it doesn’t leak. Keep the breathing on while the water comes through it. Keep breathing through the mouth slowly. Before going on other side, Blow out air gently through both nostrils to clear mucus and water from the nose. After the whole liquid finished, stand up and blow out gently through both nostrils and then prepare to dry out the nose. Even after this, if your nose doesn’t get clear than it is recommended that you visit the family physician to ascertain if there is some kind of structural blockage in the nose. Forward bend drying of the nose properly is very important part of this practice. People suffering from high blood pressure should be careful while doing this part. If dizziness occurs while using neti the nose, drying should be done standing upright. First bend towards forward from the waist and do head upside down with the nose towards the floor that will help any residual water to remove from the nose. Then the nose is to be pointed towards the knees. Then resume the standing position and do some fast breathing through the nostrils. Then do 10 rapid sniffing breathes again through both the nostrils together. It is important dry nose properly as it may manifest the symptoms of cold for some hours, or in some cases it may cause sinus problem. The second stage of Jala neti is called as sinus bellowing, or Vyutkrama kapalbhati. One should not swallow any water when they sniff backwards, although it’s not dangerous. The nose has to be dry completely after stage 2, as more water flow from the nasal passages. It may cause serious irritation for some time if nose is not dried completely. Do not consume; to avoid infection dry nose completely. In Dugdha neti, milk is used in place of water, pre-warmed to body temperature, It is suitable for those person who suffer from chronic nose bleeds or those who get irritation from the use of salty water. Milk Neti is done in case where the nasal lining is already irritated, for example in case of sanding plaster. Milk neti is used in case where nasal mucosa is already irritated, from the sanding plaster. Some time there is a problem like some kind of fleshy obstruction such as cartilages. In case of polpys, deviated septum or other diseases related to nose consult to the ENT specialist. The string of sutra neti is slowly and non-mechanically inserted along the floor of the nasal cavity. Nasal cavity is narrow at the top and it is widest at the bottom, it is like a roof. Hence keep the string straight positioned towards the back side of the throat, a little towards downward and slightly inward so it will go smoothly inside the back opening of the nose. If you experience any pain, it is because of going too fast or the string is pointed in the wrong side, or it is scratched the nasal wall, or there may be some other obstruction. It is advisable to keep the tip of string smooth while keeping a little downward direction of the tip throughout the insertion, So that while going under the medium bottom lip of the nasal pharyngeal valve at the entrance to the throat, it points downward toward the mouth. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth. As a result of a short period with an unusually high number \n\n A snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving mask. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and constructed of light metal, rubber or plastic.\n\nQuestion: In which sport or pastime can you see nose walking?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During gonioscopy, you sit in a chair facing the microscope used to look inside your eye. You will place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar while looking straight ahead. The goniolens is placed lightly on the front of your eye, and a narrow beam of light is directed into your eye while your doctor looks through the slit lamp at the drainage angle. Drops will be used to numb the eye before the test. There are two types of ophthalmoscopy: direct and indirect. With indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ophthalmologist wears a headband with a light attached and uses a small handheld lens to look inside your eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy allows a better view of the fundus, even if your natural lens is clouded by cataracts. The peripheral (side) vision of each eye is tested with visual field testing, or perimetry. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights will flash off and on. A computer records your response to each flash. Photography . Sometimes photographs or other computerized images are taken of the optic nerve to inspect the nerve more closely for damage from elevated pressure in the eye. Special imaging . The most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma , in which the aqueous fluid is blocked from flowing back out of the eye at a normal rate through a tiny drainage system. Most people who develop primary open-angle glaucoma notice no symptoms until their vision is impaired. If your risk is high, your eye doctor may recommend treatment to lower your IOP to prevent future damage. In angle-closure glaucoma , the iris (the colored part of the eye) may drop over and completely close off the drainage angle, abruptly blocking the flow of aqueous fluid and leading to increased IOP and optic nerve damage. In acute angle-closure glaucoma there is a sudden increase in IOP due to the buildup of aqueous fluid. This condition is considered an emergency because optic nerve damage and vision loss can occur within hours of the problem. This condition is called normal-tension glaucoma . Normal-tension glaucoma is not well understood, but lowering IOP has been shown to slow progression of this form of glaucoma. Your eye doctor will often set a “target” pressure for you and will adjust the treatment to keep the pressure close to or below that target to help preserve your vision. During these tests, the patient is required only to remain still while the image is scanned. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is a relatively common form of open-angle glaucoma that can cause significantly high eye pressures. This material can clog the ocular drainage system, increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) . Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is found in all ethnic groups, but it is most commonly seen in people of Scandinavian ancestry. Treatment is often required for pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, consisting of medication, laser treatment, or surgery. Pseudoexfoliation can cause increased complications with cataract surgery. With proper treatment and monitoring, patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma tend to do well. If your eye is injured, there is a chance you will develop traumatic glaucoma. If an eye is hit hard enough to cause bleeding in the front part of the eye, this is called a hyphema . A hyphema increases the possibility of a rise in eye pressure. In cases of a hyphema, there is also a chance of a future increase in eye pressure. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights flash. What's the difference between glaucoma and ocular hypertension? Why does my eye doctor want to do more than one kind of glaucoma test? The two most common types of \"glaucoma tests\" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry. In non-contact tonometry (NCT), an instrument emits a quick puff of air toward the surface of your eye. Nothing but air touches your cornea. The \"gold standard\" method for measuring eye pressure is called applanation tonometry. In applanation tonometry, the instrument that measures your IOT has a small sensor that gently touches the surface of your eye. If you have NCT performed during your eye exam, your eye doctor might want to recheck the pressure measurement by performing applanation tonometry (especially if your NCT measurement is borderline high). Who is most at risk for glaucoma? Is there any way to prevent glaucoma? Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma. Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be reversed. If the drops don't work, surgery may be the next step. Can marijuana be used to treat glaucoma? The possible use of marijuana for the management of glaucoma has been debated for years. However, the current consensus among clinicians is that medical marijuana needs further research as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma, and that it currently does not appear to be as effective as FDA-approved glaucoma medications and treatments. People being treated for glaucoma typically are not good candidates for LASIK. This is because a suction device is used on the eye during the creation of the corneal flap during LASIK surgery, and this briefly causes a significant increase in IOP. But you might be a candidate for another type of vision correction surgery, such as PRK, which does not require the use of a suction device. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg. At Executive Park Eye Care, our eye doctors will perform a glaucoma test as part of your comprehensive eye exam. Our Colorado Springs office is equipped with state-of-the-art optometric technology that will diagnose glaucoma accurately. Who is at high risk for Glaucoma? What happens during a Glaucoma Eye Exam in Colorado Springs, CO? After your eye is numbed with eye drops, a tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure (IOP). For the best preventive care – contact us to schedule your eye exam and glaucoma test in our optometry practice in Colorado Springs. What are some Glaucoma Treatments offered by eye doctors in Colorado Springs? The current goal of all glaucoma treatments is to lower or stabilize the pressure in your eye, which will hopefully prevent damage to your optic nerve. The first line of defense is typically medicated eye drops. Depending upon how far the disease has progressed, other glaucoma treatments include conventional (bladed) surgery, laser procedures or a combination of all of the above. Tonometry is a technique used by eye care professionals to measure the intraocular pressure (IOP), which refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. It plays a crucial role in evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma. There are different types of tonometers available, but most are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The specific method used may vary depending on the equipment and technique employed by the eye care professional. One common type of tonometry is called applanation tonometry, which involves gently touching the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) with a small probe or device. This allows for an accurate measurement of IOP based on how much force is needed to flatten a small area of the cornea. Another type is non-contact tonometry, also known as air-puff tonometry. In this method, a quick puff of air is directed towards the cornea while a sensor measures changes in reflection or indentation caused by the air puff. Overall, tonometry serves as an essential tool for evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma because it allows eye care professionals to measure intraocular pressure accurately.\n\nQuestion: In which occupation would you rotate the gog at the end of your nose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Visually Impaired (VI): Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment and the athlete with visual impairment are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates. Boccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. The aim of the game is to throw leather balls – coloured red or blue (which side gets which is determined by a coin toss) – as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. In this fashion, each end will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with hands, feet, or, if the competitor’s disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. If both teams have the same amount of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner. The number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). Team competition is six ends, and six balls per team per end (two per player). The surface of the court is flat and smooth. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid. BC1 – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside of the competitor’s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested. The classification system allows riders to compete against others with a similar level of function. This is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments. Teams have five players, including the goalkeeper. The ball is equipped with a noise-making device to allow players to locate it by sound. Three classes of athletes – B1 (totally or almost totally bind) and B2&B3 (partially sighted). Goalball is a team sport designed for blind athletes. Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball that has bells embedded in it into the opponents’ goal. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the bell to judge the position and movement of the ball. Blindfolds allow partially sighted players to compete on an equal footing with blind players. Paralympic judo is an adaptation of the Japanese martial art of judo for visually impaired competitors. Single shells for the Arms and Shoulders category must have stabilising pontoons attached to the riggers. There are adaptations like the use of a shooting chair for competitors unable to stand, also a shooting table for events like kneeling or prone. Significant differences include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in able-bodied swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called “tappers” stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. Paralympic table tennis is asport which follows the standard rules with slight modifications for wheelchair athletes. The usual table tennis rules are in effect with the only rule difference being that the serve must cross the back of the table before it crosses the sides of the table. Some exceptions – “travelling” in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches his wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again. All teams use a classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. The goal lineis the section of the end line within the key. For a goal to count, two wheels of the player’s wheelchair must cross the line while the player has possession of the ball. The size of courts, balls, and rackets are same, but there are two major differences f- they use specially designed wheelchairs and the ball may bounce up to two times. The second bounce may also occur outside of the field. Quads players can hold rackets taped to the hand and use electric-powered wheelchairs. Rugby Fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It is played mainly in the United Kingdom. It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex Fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, famous Headmaster of Rugby School, who had played Wessex Fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth's Grammar, now Warminster School. An early mention of the game can be found in the novel Tom Brown's School Days (1857) by Thomas Hughes. The game is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a 'bar' across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population. It played by its own rules for many years. This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the sin bin and is signaled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a yellow card (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union.

Rugby, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal.\n\nQuestion: What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Father of Railways, George Stephenson, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of the steam engine, and \n\n During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\n Lime Street Station. Early regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) and Collins Line and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines Cunard Line and White Star Line continuing throughout the 19th Century. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. In 1826, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company (L&MR) was authorised to construct the world's first intercity railway. One obstacle on the selected 50 km route between Liverpool and Manchester was the Sankey Valley. The company's principal engineer, George Stephenson, designed the Sankey Viaduct for the double-track railway to traverse the valley and Sankey Canal with sufficient clearance for the masts and sails of the Mersey flats that used the canal. On 15 September 1830, the viaduct was opened along with the Liverpool & Manchester railway.\n\nQuestion: The age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of the Liverpool-Manchester line?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This production was directed by Danny Boyle with a cast including Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, with the two lead actors alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. Frankenstein ended its run on 2 May 2011. The National Theatre's production of Frankenstein returned to cinema screens worldwide for a limited season in June, July and December 2012, as well as for encore screenings in October and November 2013. The films were made available as part of the National Theatre's NT at Home series for a week from 30 April 2020, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the creature available starting from 30 April, and Jonny Lee Miller as the creature starting from 1 May. It is believed the film disappeared soon after its initial release because it was so heavily edited, little of interest to audiences remained. Producer Albertini, also a well-known Italian actor in his day, played the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein in this version. In this film, Victor clones himself instead of creating the creature from the dead.

In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized.

Mr. ZIP was featured prominently alongside musical group \"The Swingin' Six\" in a variety show that the post office used to explain the importance of using ZIP codes.

According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: \"Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes \n\n A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. These shapes are not limited by the fox's own age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. Kitsune-gao ('fox-faced') refers to human \n\n The following is a list of appearances made by kitsune (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. Embedded in popular folklore as they are, kitsune have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works.\n\nQuestion: What are the shape-shifting foxes of the Japanese folklore?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
