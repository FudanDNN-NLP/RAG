The latter's father is unknown (one possibility is the local mayor and well-off landowner Neculache Brăescu), and he remained sensitive to the fact of his illegitimate birth, adopting a pseudonym (after the Zeletin River that passes through Burdusaci) to distance himself from his mother's husband.\n\n"

According to Max Bruchet, one of the fears of the Council in those days was the growing influence of French princes over Savoy: the Duke of Berry had married his daughter to Amadeus VII and his grandson, Amadeus VIII, would one day rule Savoy. The young Amadeus was also betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Philip II, the Duke of Burgundy. In 1367, James, lord of Piedmont, a cousin of Amadeus, died. There was a dispute over his inheritance between his eldest son, Philip and his widow, Margaret of Beaujeu, representing the interests of her young sons, Amadeus and Louis. He was the second son of Amadeus III and Mahaut d'Auvergne. He reversed the policy of his father and brother respecting the House of Savoy, and supported the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva against his cousin Amadeus VI of Savoy. Amadeus seems to have come to terms with his Savoyard cousin by 13 May 1368, the date on which he performed the act of homage to him for the county of Geneva.

According to Max Bruchet, one of the fears of the Council in those days was the growing influence of French princes over Savoy: the Duke of Berry had married his daughter to Amadeus VII and his grandson, Amadeus VIII, would one day rule Savoy. The young Amadeus was also betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Philip II, the Duke of Burgundy. In 1367, James, lord of Piedmont, a cousin of Amadeus, died. There was a dispute over his inheritance between his eldest son, Philip and his widow, Margaret of Beaujeu, representing the interests of her young sons, Amadeus and Louis. He was the second son of Amadeus III and Mahaut d'Auvergne. He reversed the policy of his father and brother respecting the House of Savoy, and supported the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva against his cousin Amadeus VI of Savoy. Amadeus seems to have come to terms with his Savoyard cousin by 13 May 1368, the date on which he performed the act of homage to him for the county of Geneva. It is possible that the real reason for his accompanying Amadeus into Italy was to have an opportunity to speak with the Emperor, who was also in the region at that time. Amadeus IV died later that year.\n\n"

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time she experiences delusions about meeting God, who ultimately appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Meanwhile, her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, and her brother struggles with sexual frustration. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. Through a Glass Darkly was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

In 1016&ndash;1017, his father, Bernard I (1009-1018), feuded with Gero, Archbishop of Magdeburg, and consequently with the Emperor Henry II over the ambitions of the Magdeburger church. The Emperor intervened and forced Bernard I to pay Gero 500 lbs of silver in compensation for the assault his men had made on the city of Magdeburg. He left a widow, Adelaide, daughter of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark. Thietmar (IV) (born ca. 990; died 10 January 1030) was the Count of the Schwabengau and Nordthüringgau from 1010 and the Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark from 1015 until his death.

He was the son of Otto Carl Friedrich Westphal (1800–1879) and Karoline Friederike Heine and the father of Alexander Karl Otto Westphal (1863-1941). He was married to Klara, daughter of the banker Alexander Mendelssohn. Academic career After receiving his doctorate, he worked at the Berlin Charité, and subsequently became an assistant in the department for the mentally ill under Wilhelm Griesinger (1817–1868) and Karl Wilhelm Ideler (1795–1860). Achievements in medicine Westphal's contributions to medical science are many; in 1871 he coined the term \"agoraphobia\", when he observed that three male patients of his displayed extreme anxiety and feelings of dread when they had to enter certain public areas of the city. He also demonstrated a relationship between tabes dorsalis (nerve degeneration in the spinal cord) and paralysis in the mentally insane. A large portion of his written work dealt with diseases of the spinal cord and neuropathological issues. His son, Alexander Karl Otto Westphal (1863–1941) was also a psychiatrist, and is associated with the Westphal-Piltz syndrome (neurotonic pupillary reaction).

It was the successor of Scribner's Monthly Magazine. It was merged into The Forum in 1930. The Woman's Viewpoint was a woman's magazine founded in Texas in 1923 and published by Florence M. Sterling. As sole owner, she published the books herself and donated many copies to libraries and people of influence. Ladies' Home Journal was an American magazine published by the Meredith Corporation. It was first published on February 16, 1883, and eventually became one of the leading women's magazines of the 20th century in the United States. From 1891 it was published in Philadelphia by the Curtis Publishing Company. In 1903, it was the first American magazine to reach one million subscribers. It was then available quarterly on newsstands only, though its website remained in operation. Ladies' Home Journal was one of the Seven Sisters, as a group of women's service magazines were known. The editorial staff members included Ola Harris Beaubien, Katherine Allen Lively and Mrs. Eric Tarrant Davis. Regular columns and features of the magazine were meant to be of interest to women and included advice on caring for children, fashion, a shopping guide, health and beauty advice and entertainment columns. Other articles were political in nature and encouraged women to vote.\n\n"

He succeeded as Earl of Strathmore following the stabbing of Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in a drunken altercation in 1728. Anne Bowes-Lyon was born in Washington, D.C., in 1917. Anne's paternal grandfather was Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, father of her aunt Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who was born Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. John Patrick Bowes-Lyon, Master of Glamis (1 January 1910 – 19 September 1941), killed in action, unmarried ; Lady Cecilia Bowes-Lyon (28 February 1912 – 20 March 1947) she was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on 3 May 1923. She married Major Kenneth Douglas Evelyn Herbert Harington on 8 March 1939. ; Timothy Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 16th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (18 March 1918 – 13 September 1972) married Mary Bridget Brennan on 18 June 1958. ; Lady Nancy Moira Bowes-Lyon (18 March 1918 – 11 February 1959) she married Lance Amigo Percy Burra Robinson on 25 April 1940; they were divorced in 1950.\n\n"

Meritites died during the reign of her brother Khafre. Scenes include Paser and his mother Merytre as mummies and a canopic shrine with its jars being libated by his brother Titia. On the same pillar Paser's brother Titia is depicted again offering before Paser and his mother Merytre. Another pillar depicts Paser and his parents worshipping the Gods. There are scenes before Osiris and Maat, his parents before Wenennufer, and Paser participating in a Valley Festival, praising Re and Amun. The texts include a hymn to Osiris, the Song of the Harper, a biographical text and praise of King Ramesses II. Meritites II was probably a daughter of Khufu, as she was said to be a King's daughter of his body and as the location of her tomb indicates a relation to Khufu. Meritites was married to Akhethotep, who was a director of the palace. Meritites II (Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A (\"beloved of her father\") was a 4th Dynasty princess of ancient Egypt, probably a daughter of King Khufu. She may have been a daughter of Meritites I based on the fact that this queen is mentioned in mastaba G 7650. She married the Director of the Palace, Akhethotep (a non-royal court official), and she had several children with her husband. Meritites and her husband shared a mastaba G 7650 in Giza. She was buried at Bab el-Gasus under the pontificate of Psusennes II.\n\n"

Chapier died in his sleep at home in the early hours of Sunday 27 January 2019. Henry Chapier (14 November 1933 – 27 January 2019) was a French journalist, film critic, television presenter and feature film director. He received some high-profile assignments, for instance a Colleen Moore vehicle and two features for Derelys Perdue, but he was a generation older than other directors in Hollywood's French colony. Chautard died in Los Angeles, California.\n\n"

The neighbors heard Mendieta scream out no and right before her death Andre had scratches all over his face. There were no eyewitnesses to the events that led up to Mendieta's death. According to Loyola Press, she was a saint because of her charitable works, not her trances, demonstrated by her forgiveness towards a group of people who abused her during a trance, despite the excruciating pain they caused her. She ministered to the sick and the poor, moving into the hospital in Siena towards the end of her life, \"subjecting herself to great mortifications\". Geraldine Anne Ferraro was born on August 26, 1935, in Newburgh, New York, the daughter of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, Campania) and owner of two restaurants. After her death, the Foundation of the House of Bragança bought the painting \"Battle of Cape St. Vincent\", a Portuguese national treasure that had been included in her inheritance, depicting a victory of the fleet of Maria II of Portugal over the fleet of Miguel I of Portugal during the Liberal Wars. It is now located in the Maritime Museum in Lisbon.\n\n"

The film is based on the life of Evan Perry, who experienced bipolar depression from a young age. The documentary was filmed throughout Evan's life, because whenever his parents, Dana and Hart Perry, consulted a psychiatrist about Evan's suicidal comments or other signs of mental illness, the psychiatrists did not believe that their son was depressed. The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed. Evan Perry had a family medical history involving serious mental illnesses. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him. About four years after Evan's death, the documentary was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and released on television and DVD.

The film is a take on the classic \"boogeyman\", or monster in the closet, who is the main antagonist of the film. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, often citing a generic and unoriginal plot as the main criticism. Despite receiving negative reviews from critics, the film was a financial success, and was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Boogeyman 2 (2007) and Boogeyman 3 (2008). The film was written and directed by Frank Darabont. Darabont had been interested in adapting \"The Mist\" for the big screen since the 1980s. The film features an ensemble cast, including Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Nathan Gamble, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, Frances Sternhagen, Buck Taylor, William Sadler, David Jensen, Sam Witwer, Alexa Davalos, Robert Treveiler, Chris Owen, Andy Stahl, and future The Walking Dead actors Jeffrey DeMunn, Laurie Holden, Melissa McBride, and Juan Gabriel Pareja.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life.\n\nQuestion: Do both films Fig Leaves and Boogeyman (Film) have the directors that share the same nationality?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
