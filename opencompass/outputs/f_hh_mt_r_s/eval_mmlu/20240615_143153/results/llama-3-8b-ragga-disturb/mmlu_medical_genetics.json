This type of translocation can be detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype analysis of affected cells. In contrast, Robertsonian translocation does not involve the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes but rather the fusion of two entire chromosomes. This type of translocation typically occurs between acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres located near one end) and may result in no extra or missing genetic information if it is balanced. It's important to note that both reciprocal and Robertsonian translocations can have significant implications for an individual's health and fertility. of Robertsonian translocations are generally not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but do have an increased risk of generating meiotically unbalanced. Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes get attached, meaning that given two healthy pairs of chromosomes, one of each pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. A gene fusion may be created when the translocation joins two otherwise-separated genes. Translocations can be balanced (in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing, and ideally full functionality) or unbalanced (where the exchange of chromosome material is unequal resulting in extra or missing genes). Reciprocal translocations\nReciprocal translocations are usually an exchange of material between non-homologous chromosomes and occur in about 1 in 491 live births. Such translocations are usually harmless and may be found through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to distinguish between chromosomal translocations occurring in gametogenesis, due to errors in meiosis, and translocations that occur in cellular division of somatic cells, due to errors in mitosis. The former results in a chromosomal abnormality featured in all cells of the offspring, as in translocation carriers. Somatic translocations, on the other hand, result in abnormalities featured only in the affected cell line, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Robertsonian translocations\nRobertsonian translocation is a type of translocation caused by breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes 13 and 14 and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns. Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but there is a risk of unbalanced gametes that lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring. For example, carriers of Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 21 have a higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of uniparental disomy 14 due to trisomy rescue. Role in disease\nSome human diseases caused by translocations are:\n Cancer: Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations (as opposed to those present from conception); this has been described mainly in leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia). The translocation is the mechanism that can cause a gene to move from one linkage group to another. This is also true for humans, where non-random segregation occurs when structurally abnormal chromosomes are present as a result of Robertsonian translocations. This occurs when two fragments from different chromosomes are switched. On the other hand, Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes become attached together, resulting in the fusion of one part of each chromosome. Reciprocal translocations are usually harmless and can be detected through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to note that most carriers of balanced translocations are healthy and do not experience any symptoms. Robertsonian translocations, on the other hand, involve the fusion of two chromosomes. A gene fusion may result from this translocation, joining two separate genes. Robertsonian translocations are also detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype of affected cells. It is crucial to differentiate between chromosomal translocations that occur during gametogenesis (errors in meiosis) and those that happen in cellular division of somatic cells (errors in mitosis). Translocations in gametogenesis result in a chromosomal abnormality present in all cells of the offspring, such as translocation carriers.

It was originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) transcription factor IIIA. Xenopus laevis TFIIIA was originally demonstrated to contain zinc and require the metal for function in 1983, the first such reported zinc requirement for a gene regulatory protein followed soon thereafter by the Krüppel factor in Drosophila. The crystal structures of zinc finger-DNA complexes solved in 1991 and 1993 revealed the canonical pattern of interactions of zinc fingers with DNA. The binding of zinc finger is found to be distinct from many other DNA-binding proteins that bind DNA through the 2-fold symmetry of the double helix, instead zinc fingers are linked linearly in tandem to \n\n a metal-binding domain in multi-domain proteins. Proteins that contain zinc fingers (zinc finger proteins) are classified into several different structural families. Unlike many other clearly defined supersecondary structures such as Greek keys or β hairpins, there are a number of types of zinc fingers, each with a unique three-dimensional architecture. A particular zinc finger protein's class is determined by this three-dimensional structure, but it can also be recognized based on the primary structure of the protein or the identity of the ligands coordinating the zinc ion. These motifs include the helix-turn-helix, the homeodomain motif, the zinc finger, the leucine zipper, and the helix-loop-helix motifs. It is a 60-amino acid helix-turn-helix motif that is involved in gene regulation during development. Zinc fingers are another class of DNA-binding motifs commonly found in transcription factors. They are named after the zinc ion that is coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues within the motif. Leucine zippers are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. They consist of two alpha helices with leucine residues at regular intervals, which form a coiled coil structure. They consist of two alpha helices connected by a loop region. Zinc fingers exhibit ββα protein fold in which a β-hairpin and a α-helix are joined via a ion.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

Since females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), the inheritance of X-linked recessive diseases differs between males and females. For males, since they only have one X chromosome, if they inherit the mutated gene, they will develop the disease because they do not have another normal copy of the gene to compensate. Thus, if a male inherits the mutated gene from his carrier mother, he will be affected by the disease. If a carrier female passes on her mutated X chromosome to her offspring (regardless of the child's sex), there is a 50% chance that her son will inherit the mutated gene and be affected by the disease. To summarize, the inheritance pattern of an X-linked recessive disease involves a 50% chance of a male being affected if the female parent is a carrier, while females can be carriers themselves but are generally not affected by the disease due to the presence of a second X chromosome. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% chance of having a male that is affected, a 25% chance of having a female that is a carrier, and a 50% chance of having a normal male or female. However, if a male with a less severe phenotype reproduces, all of his daughters are carriers, and none of his sons will be affected. If both parents are carriers: ; 25% (1 in 4) children will have the disease ; 50% (2 in 4) children will be carriers, but unaffected ; 25% (1 in 4) children will be free of MLD – unaffected child that is not a carrier ; If one parent is affected and one is free of MLD: ; 0% (0) children will have the disorder – only one parent is affected, other parent always gives normal gene ; 100% (4 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected) ; If one parent is a carrier and the other is free of MLD: ; 50% (2 in 4) children will \n\n A number of genetic disorders are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are hemizygous), they are more frequent in males than in females.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

The base pairs in DNA consist of four different nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The base pairs in DNA adhere to a specific pattern referred to as the Watson-Crick base pairing rules. These rules dictate that adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C). This pairing is based on hydrogen bonding, where adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, and guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds. This notation signifies that adenine and thymine are complementary to each other, meaning they always pair up, and guanine and cytosine are also complementary and form base pairs together. This arrangement of base pairs creates a double-helix structure in DNA, where the two strands are held together by the hydrogen bonds formed between the complementary bases. In summary, the relationship between base pairs in a DNA molecule is a complementary pairing, with adenine (A) always pairing with thymine (T) and guanine (G) always pairing with cytosine (C).

Rueffert H, Rosenberg H. Rueffert H, Rosenberg H Rueffert, Henrik, and Henry Rosenberg.. \"Malignant Hyperthermia.\" Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered by potent halogenated volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants and in rare case by strenuous exercise and/or heat exposure, too. However, patients with central core disease (CCD) who are at risk for MH may display muscle weakness. The resulting hypermetabolic syndrome is characterized by typical clinical signs such as tachycardia, hypercapnia, acidosis, muscle rigidity, and breakdown as well as hyperthermia. The ryanodine receptor subtype 1 (RYR1; fast calcium-releasing channel) is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of MH. Besides symptomatic therapy dantrolene sodium is the only effective and specific treatment drug for MH (RYR1 antagonist). A patient advocacy organization exists in the United States, Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) (www.mhaus.org). In Europe, the European MH Group (www.emhg.org) sponsors meetings and research into the syndrome. The disposition to MH is inherited in humans in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance and expressivity. The majority of MH cases (>70%) is linked to the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) located on chromosome 19q13.1 (MHS-1). About 30 RYR1 mutations were proven causal for MH. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is indeed a genetic disorder characterized by a hypermetabolic response in skeletal muscle. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the condition. However, with prompt recognition and appropriate management, the prognosis is generally good. The underlying cause of MH is a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene. The specific mutation in the RYR1 gene leads to an abnormal release of calcium, which triggers an excessive release of calcium from the muscle's storage compartments. Diagnosis of MH typically involves a combination of clinical signs and specific diagnostic testing, such as the caffeine-halothane contracture test or genetic testing to identify the RYR1 mutation. In conclusion, malignant hyperthermia is a genetically inherited disorder characterized by hypermetabolism in skeletal muscle. Understanding the underlying genetic mutation and avoiding triggering factors is crucial for the proper management and prevention of MH episodes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

This included genes that encoded easily observable characteristics such as blood types or seed shapes. This prompted the development of gene markers which could identify genetic characteristics that are not readily observable in organisms (such as protein variation). The strategy of chromosome walking is based on the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the genomic library being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to screen the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for chromosome walking \n\nWhen determining the resolution of a genetic linkage study for positional cloning of human disease genes, several factors need to be considered. Firstly, it is important to identify the rough chromosomal location of the disease gene through a genome-scan linkage analysis. This analysis helps to narrow down the potential region where the disease gene might be located. Once the rough chromosomal location is identified, fine structure genetic mapping is performed. This involves conducting further genetic mapping to define and narrow down the chromosomal interval where the disease gene may be present. In addition to genetic mapping, physical mapping and gene identification are crucial steps in the positional cloning process. Physical mapping involves determining the physical distance between genetic markers and the disease gene, often using techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or DNA sequencing. Gene identification involves identifying and characterizing the specific gene responsible for the disease. This refers to how narrow the identified genetic interval is and whether it can be efficiently dissected using physical mapping and gene identification methods. Factors that affect the resolution include the distance between the nearest crossovers that flank the disease locus in a set of chromosomes, the distance between the nearest genetic markers that flank the pair of flanking crossovers after a genome scan, and the distance between the nearest flanking markers after additional markers are generated and typed in the identified interval. By understanding the limits of resolution and considering factors such as sample size and the number of markers used, researchers can determine whether a proposed positional cloning study is likely to be successful in identifying the disease gene. Please note that the mentioned factors are based on the general principles of genetic linkage studies for positional cloning and may vary depending on the specific disease and research context. 4.Interference decreases the chance of multiple crossing-over.1.4.3 Double crossovers are revealed in three-point crosses.3.One crossover can undo the effects of another.3.Physical distance is often--but not always--correlated with map distance.2.A linkage group is a genetic map of the genes in a chromosome.1.4.2 Recombination results from crossing-over between linked alleles.2.3.4 Eukaryotic chromosomes are highly coiled complexes of DNA and protein.

Separation or bereavement in families, and childhood trauma, be risk factors for psychosis and schizophrenia. Children are much more susceptible to psychological harm from traumatic events than adults. Study shows that human-induced trauma, such as a tumultuous childhood, affects children even more than natural disasters. Neglect most often happens during childhood by the parents or caretakers. Parents who are guilty of neglect were also neglected as children. many incidences of self-inflicted harm. A well-documented, long-term negative effect is repeated or additional victimization in adolescence and adulthood. A causal relationship has been found between childhood sexual abuse and various adult psychopathologies, including crime and suicide,    in addition to alcoholism and drug abuse. Males who were sexually abused as children more frequently appear in the criminal justice system than in a clinical mental health setting. A study comparing middle-aged women who were abused as children with non-abused counterparts found significantly higher health care costs for the former. Intergenerational effects have been noted, with the children of victims of child sexual abuse exhibiting more conduct problems, peer problems, and emotional problems than their \n\nChildhood trauma is often described as serious adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Children may go through a range of experiences that classify as psychological trauma; these might include neglect, abandonment, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and physical abuse, witnessing abuse of a sibling or parent, or having a mentally ill parent. These events have profound psychological, physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being such as unsocial behaviors, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Similarly, children with mothers who have experienced traumatic or stressful events during pregnancy can increase the child's risk of mental health disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 study on adverse childhood experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy self-destructive behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises. Health \n\nTraumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual's allostatic load and thus affects the immune system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and premature mortality. Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior. Recent research has found that physical and sexual abuse are associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood, while personality disorders and schizophrenia are linked with emotional abuse as adults. In addition, research has proposed that mental health outcomes from childhood trauma may be better understood through a dimensional framework (internalizing and externalizing) as opposed to specific disorders. Psychological impact\n\nChildhood trauma can increase the risk of mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments. The conclusion of the study shows that there is a correlation between the effects of childhood trauma and the being at high risk for psychosis. Survivors of childhood trauma are also at higher risk of developing asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes or having a stroke. Epigenetics \n\nChildhood trauma can leave epigenetic marks on a child's genes, which chemically modify gene expression by silencing or activating genes. Another recent study in rhesus macaques showed that DNA methylation changes related to early-life adversity persisted into adulthood. Survivors of war trauma or childhood maltreatment are at increased risk for trauma-spectrum disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Traumatic experiences might even affect psychological as well as biological parameters in the next generation, i.e. traumatic stress might have trans generational effects. Parental trauma exposure was found to be associated with greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood and anxiety disorders in offspring since biological alterations associated with PTSD and/or other stress-related disorders have also been observed in offspring of trauma survivors who do not themselves report trauma exposure or psychiatric disorder. Animal models have demonstrated that stress exposure can result in epigenetic alterations in the next generation, and such mechanisms have been hypothesized to underpin vulnerability to symptoms in offspring of trauma survivors. Enduring behavioral responses to stress and epigenetic alterations in adult offspring have been demonstrated to be mediated by changes in gametes in utero effects, variations in early postnatal care, and/or other early life experiences that are influenced by parental exposure (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer, and Binder, 2015). Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. Socioeconomic costs \nThe social and economic costs of child abuse and neglect are difficult to calculate. Transgenerational effects\n\nPeople can pass their epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to their children. This is known as transgenerational trauma or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically. Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions. A growing body of literature suggests that children's experiences of trauma and abuse within close relationships not only jeopardize their well-being in childhood, but can also have long-lasting consequences that extend well into adulthood. These long-lasting consequences can include emotion regulation issues, which can then be passed onto subsequent generations through child-parent interactions and learned behaviors. (see also behavioral epigenetics, epigenetics, historical trauma, and cycle of violence)\n\nResilience\n\nExposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood. Therefore, there are factors that reduce the impact of potentially traumatic events and protect an individual from developing mental health problems after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Research regarding children who showed adaptive development while facing adversity began in the 1970s and continues to this day. Furthermore, that same individual may recover more quickly and successfully from a potentially traumatic experience than an individual who could be said to be less resilient. In children, level of functioning is operationalized as the child continuing to behave in a manner that is considered developmentally appropriate for a child of that age. One factor that does not affect resilience is gender, with both males and females being equally sensitive to risk and protective factors. Attachment has been shown to be one of the most important factors to consider when it comes to evaluating the relative resilience of an individual. Children with secure attachments to an adult with effective coping strategies were most likely to endure adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in an adaptive manner. Secure attachment to one's peers throughout adolescence is a particularly strong predictor of resilience. Within the context of abuse, it is thought that these secure attachments decrease the extent to which children who are abused perceive others as being untrustworthy. In other words, while some children who are abused might begin to view other people as being unsafe and unable to be trusted, children who are able to develop and maintain healthy relationships are less likely to hold these views. Children who experience trauma but also experience healthy attachment with multiple groups of people (in essence, adults, peers, romantic partners, etc.) throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are particularly resilient. Personality also affects the development (or lack of development) of adult psychopathology as a result of childhood abuse. Furthermore, individuals with higher scores on openness to experience, conscientiousness, and extraversion have been found to be more resilient to the effects of childhood trauma. Successful adaptation, or resilience, is quite common among children. This is due in part to the naturally adaptive nature of childhood development. Therefore, interventions that promote strong parent-child bonds are particularly effective at buffering against the potential negative effects of trauma. Furthermore, researchers of resilience argue that successful adaptation is not merely an end result but rather a developmental process that is ongoing throughout a person's lifetime. Prognosis\nTrauma affects all children differently (see stress in early childhood). Types of trauma\n\nBullying \nBullying is any unprovoked action with the intention of harming, either physically or psychologically, someone who is considered to have less power, either physically or socially. For example, cognitive complications (dissociation), affective, somatic, behavioral, relational, and self-attributional problems have been seen in individuals who have experienced complex trauma. Exposure to natural disaster constitutes a risk factor for poor psychological health in children and adolescents. Outcomes for children include psychological distress, behavioral disorders, disturbances in self-regulation, difficulties with social interaction, and disorganized attachment. Younger children are completely dependent on their caregivers than older children not only for physical care but also emotional care. This is needed for them to develop normal neurological, psychological, and social development. This dependence can contribute to their vulnerability to witnessing violence against their caregivers. Children may experience disruptions in their attachment with their caregivers due to their traumatic medical experience. For example, a young child may feel betrayed by their parents if they have had to participate in activities that have cause and contributed to the child's pain such as administering medications or taking them to the doctor. At the same time, the parent-child relationship is strained due to parents feeling powerless, guilt, or inadequacy. Refugee trauma \nRefugee-related childhood trauma can take place in the child's country of origin due to war, persecution, or violence, but can also be a result of the process of displacement or even the disruptions and transitions of resettlement into the destination country. Some outcomes from experiencing trauma in refugee children are behavioral problems, mood and anxiety disorders, PTSD, and adjustment difficulty. Separation trauma \nSeparation trauma is a disruption in an attachment relationship that disrupts neurological development and can lead to death. Theoretically grounded in attachment, trauma, and developmental theories and specifically addresses three core domains impacted by exposure to chronic, interpersonal trauma: attachment, self-regulation, and developmental competencies.

Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as physical or emotional neglect or both, abuse, poverty, malnutrition, and traumatic experiences can have long-lasting negative consequences. Adverse experiences in childhood can affect the structural and functional development of the brain, giving structural and functional abnormalities in the future, and adulthood. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study has shown a strong dose–response relationship between ACEs and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout a person's lifespan, including suicide attempts and frequency of depressive episodes.

One of the most significant risks is the potential for mental retardation. Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. When a pregnant woman with PKU doesn't manage her condition properly, high levels of phenylalanine in her blood can cross the placenta and negatively impact the developing fetus. The severity of mental retardation can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of phenylalanine and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. It is crucial for women with PKU who are planning to become pregnant, or are already pregnant, to strictly adhere to a low-phenylalanine diet. In addition to mental retardation, there are other potential health risks associated with children born to mothers with PKU. These may include developmental delays, growth abnormalities, microcephaly (a smaller head size), congenital heart defects, and behavioral problems. Each case is unique, and the severity of these risks can vary, depending on several factors such as the mother's phenylalanine level control and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Regular prenatal care and ongoing monitoring are essential to reduce the risks associated with PKU and optimize the health outcomes for both the mother and the child. Untreated, PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene, which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms. Treatment is with a diet that (1) is low in foods that contain phenylalanine, and which (2) includes special supplements. Effectiveness is monitored through periodic blood tests. The medication sapropterin dihydrochloride may be useful in some. Phenylketonuria affects about 1 in 12,000 babies. Signs and symptoms\n\nUntreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding. If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. The disease may present clinically with seizures,  hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed. Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that the brain has an opportunity to develop normally. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability (though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma, eczema, anemia, weight gain, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, gastritis, esophagus and kidney deficiencies, kidney stones, and hypertension). In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all. If both parents are carriers for PKU, there is a 25% chance any child they have will be born with the disorder, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance the child will neither develop nor be a carrier for the disease. PKU is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr). Carriers of a single PKU allele do not exhibit symptoms of the disease but  appear to be protected to some extent against the fungal toxin ochratoxin A. Pathophysiology\nWhen phenylalanine (Phe) cannot be metabolized by the body, a typical diet that would be healthy for people without PKU causes abnormally high levels of Phe to accumulate in the blood, which is toxic to the brain. If left untreated (and often even in treatment), complications of PKU include severe intellectual disability, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as physical symptoms such as a \"musty\" odor, eczema, and unusually light skin and hair coloration. Classical PKU\nClassical PKU, and its less severe forms \"mild PKU\" and \"mild hyperphenylalaninemia\" are caused by a mutated gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts the amino acid phenylalanine (\"Phe\") to other essential compounds in the body, in particular tyrosine. Tyrosine is a conditionally essential amino acid for PKU patients because without PAH it cannot be produced in the body through the breakdown of phenylalanine. Compared to classic PKU patients, patients with \"hyperphe\" have greater PAH enzyme activity and are able to tolerate larger amounts of phenylalanine in their diets. Excessive levels of phenylalanine tend to decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. Classic PKU affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological problems associated with phenylketonuria. Those who suffer from this form of hyperphenylalaninemia may have a deficiency of tyrosine (which is created from phenylalanine by PAH), in which case treatment is supplementation of tyrosine to account for this deficiency. Levels of dopamine can be used to distinguish between these two types. Metabolic pathways\n\nThe enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. If this reaction does not take place, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening. Treatment\nPKU is not curable. However, if PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development by managing and controlling phenylalanine (\"Phe\") levels through diet, or a combination of diet and medication. People must adhere to a special diet low in Phe for optimal brain development. For people who do not have phenylketonuria, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set recommended at least 33 mg/kg body weight/day phenylalanine plus tyrosine for adults 19 years and older. For people with PKU, a recommendation for children up to age 10 years is 200 to 500 mg/d; for older children and adults below 600  mg/day . Lower-protein \"medical food\" substitutes are often used in place of normal bread, pasta, and other grain-based foods, which contain a significant amount of Phe. A diet that is low in phenylalanine but does not include protein substitutes may also fail to lower blood Phe levels, since a nutritionally insufficient diet may also trigger catabolism. For all these reasons, the prescription formula is an important part of the treatment for patients with classic PKU. leu, tyr, trp, met, his, ile, val, thr) may compete with phe for specific carrier proteins that transport LNAAs across the intestinal mucosa into the blood and across the blood–brain barrier into the brain. Enzyme substitutes\nIn 2018, the FDA approved an enzyme substitute called pegvaliase which metabolizes phenylalanine. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (a cofactor for the oxidation of phenylalanine) when taken by mouth can reduce blood levels of this amino acid in some people. Mothers\nFor women with PKU, it is important for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. In most countries, women with PKU who wish to have children are advised to lower their blood Phe levels (typically to between 2 and 6 mg/dL) before they become pregnant, and carefully control their levels throughout the pregnancy. This is achieved by performing regular blood tests and adhering very strictly to a diet, in general monitored on a day-to-day basis by a specialist metabolic dietitian. In many cases, as the fetus' liver begins to develop and produce PAH normally, the mother's blood Phe levels will drop, requiring an increased intake to remain within the safe range of 2–6 mg/dL. The mother's daily Phe intake may double or even triple by the end of the pregnancy, as a result. When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2 mg/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may suffer adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise. When low phenylalanine levels are maintained for the duration of pregnancy, there are no elevated levels of risk of birth defects compared with a baby born to a non-PKU mother. It is the most common amino acid metabolic problem in the United Kingdom. History\n\nBefore the causes of PKU were understood, PKU caused severe disability in most people who inherited the relevant mutations. Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winning author Pearl S. Buck had a daughter named Carol who lived with PKU before treatment was available, and wrote an account of its effects in a book called The Child Who Never Grew. Phenylketonuria was discovered by the Norwegian physician Ivar Asbjørn Følling in 1934 when he noticed hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was associated with intellectual disability. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called phenylketonuria (PKU). In 1954, Horst Bickel, Evelyn Hickmans and John Gerrard published a paper that described how they created a diet that was low in phenylalanine and the patient recovered. They were called for by the patient organizations such as the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria. Individuals suffering from phenylketonuria lack the enzyme to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine so low levels of this amino acid need to be \n\nThe potential consequences of leaving phenylketonuria (PKU) untreated can be severe. PKU is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is needed to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Without proper treatment, phenylalanine levels can accumulate and lead to various complications. One of the main consequences of untreated PKU is problems with brain development. Additionally, individuals with untreated PKU are at an increased risk of developing seizures. A low-phenylalanine diet and a high-tyrosine diet are recommended for individuals with PKU. This involves avoiding foods that are high in phenylalanine, such as certain meats, dairy products, and some fruits and vegetables. Instead, individuals with PKU consume specially formulated medical foods that provide adequate nutrition while limiting their intake of phenylalanine. Strict adherence to this dietary management plan can bring about significant improvement in PKU symptoms and prevent long-term complications. It allows for normal growth and development while minimizing the risk of intellectual disability and seizures associated with untreated PKU. Healthcare professionals will work closely with individuals with PKU to ensure they receive appropriate nutritional support and ongoing care. Overall, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of a low-phenylalanine diet are essential for effectively managing PKU and preventing its potential consequences on brain development and overall health.

If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, by removing the defective exon the downstream reading frame can be corrected and production of partially functional dystrophin can be restored. This is the general strategy used for designing exon-skipping oligos for DMD; as there are 79 exons transcribed in the longest splice form of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligos are needed to address the range of mutations present in the \n\n The great majority of protein-coding genes encoded within the nucleus of metazoan cells contain multiple introns. The result of alternative splicing is that a single gene can encode a number of different protein isoforms that can exhibit a variety of (usually related) biological functions. The genes were shown to be discontinuous, composed of sequences that are not present in the final mature RNA (introns), located between sequences that are retained in the mature RNA (exons). Eteplirsen is a morpholino antisense oligomer which triggers excision of exon 51 during pre-mRNA splicing of the dystrophin RNA transcript. Skipping exon 51 changes the downstream reading frame of dystrophin; giving eteplirsen to a healthy person would result in production of dystrophin mRNA which would not code for functional dystrophin protein but, for DMD patients with particular nonsense mutations, giving eteplirsen can restore the reading frame of the dystrophin mRNA and result in production of functional (although modified by having an internal deletion consisting of both the patient's original defect, as well as the therapeutically skipped exon) dystrophin.
