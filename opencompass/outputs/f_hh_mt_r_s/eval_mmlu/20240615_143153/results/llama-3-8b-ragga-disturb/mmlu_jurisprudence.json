Nigel Simmonds has rejected Dworkin's disapproval of conventionalism, claiming that his characterization of law is too narrow. This approach is epitomized by Immanuel Kant's notion of the Categorical Imperative, which was the centre to Kant's ethical theory based on duty. Threshold deontology holds that rules ought to govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the consequences become so dire that they cross a stipulated threshold, consequentialism takes over. ; 3) Virtue ethics, derived from Aristotle's and Confucius's notions, \n\n employs the analogy of the adverb to describe the kind of restraint that law involves. Laws prescribe \"adverbial conditions\": they condition our actions, but they do not determine the substantive ends of our choices. Or, to choose a more trivial example, the law does not dictate that I have a car, but if I do, I must drive it on the same side of the road as everybody else. Only general practice can determine exactly how much weaker the obligation is, and indeed the fact that the rules are recognised to be weaker in practice shows that people have \"an implicit notion\" \n\n his theory, asserting that discourse ethics ought to be complemented by a theory of socialization that accounts for its institutionalization.

In addition, he suggested there was an evolution in law-making practices. Initially, societies use legal fictions to disguise law making. They then move to broad discretion in the form of equity, and finally reaching the modern period, explicit law-making in the form of legislation. Maine also adopted a 'progressive development' theory which held contemporary 'noble' or 'progressive' nations were approaching the apotheosis of legal science achieved by Roman law. To show this, he adopted a comparative-historical approach focusing primarily on Indo-European comparisons, coupled with a geological scientific metaphor: \"'If by any means we can determine the early forms of jural conceptions, they will be \n\n to us. These rudimentary ideas are to the jurist what the primary crusts of the earth are to the geologist. They contain, potentially, all the forms in which law has subsequently exhibited itself...The inquiries of the jurist are in truth prosecuted much as inquiry in physics and physiology was prosecuted before observation had taken the place of assumption. '\"Ancient law was immensely popular in the Victorian period. Its attribution of continuous, impersonal natural laws to legal development was well matched to the great social and technological changes Britain was undergoing. Additionally, though likely completed before Origin of Species was published,  Maine's work fitted with the vogue of Darwinian thinking. Nonetheless, despite its influence, Ancient law was criticised soon after being published for the inaccuracy of its historical material and anthropological commentary. Here false contracts conceal slavery. Slaveholders can easily force their slaves to sign anything: mortgages, loan agreements, indentures, or labor contracts. If questions are raised, signed contracts are produced and corrupt law enforcement looks the other way. Even in countries with mostly honest and conscientious police, the contracts hide slavery.\" Even where a worker did voluntarily agree to something, the conditions at the place of work may be different from that which he agreed to. Additionally, even if only one worker agrees to something, members of his family and his descendants may be \n\nAntidepressants and their lack of efficacy in regards to mild to moderate depression has garnered much media attention in recent months. This is one particular tangent of discussion in a broader analysis of how the self is represented and understood in contemporary Western societies. Nikolas Rose has written extensively on this subject78; however, his accounts of the rise of neurochemical subjectivity in Western societies do not incorporate a discussion of the development of the culture of ‘therapism’ as described by Hoff Sommer and Satel9 that helped to facilitate the popular acceptance of neuroscientific discourses. The culture of ‘therapism’ arose from the emerging self-help literature market, which was to a large extent based on the writing of specialists (mental health professionals, addictions counselors and even individuals afflicted with these conditions). Behaviour is reduced to biological determinism, in the ‘neurochemical’ account of personhood. Rose does argue that this transition was in part due to neo-liberal discourses that were infiltrating civil society. For example, he does mention the public health Defeat Depression campaign in the United Kingdom as a prominent source of information and the best selling books Prozac Nation12 by Elizabeth Wurtzel and Listening to Prozac13 by Larry Kramer. Certainly, the success of these texts and campaign illustrated the very point when the ‘tipping point’ had been reached and neuroscientific theories about depression had become popular14. Moreover, many sociology of medicine texts utilize a Foucaultian conception of biopolitics that was applicable to disciplinary societies. Biopolitics conceptualized in this manner lacks a discussion of the media environments proceeding these particular texts and campaigns in both the United Kingdom and North America. In large part, Rose simply subsumes this discussion under the rubric of the rise and proliferation of neoliberalism. By omitting these very crucial threads of discussion in his research, the account developed by Rose lacks a comprehensive explanation as to the new emerging logic in the ‘psy’ knowledge networks. In particular, the very transformations in logic required for the acceptance of the flattening of the multitude of factors contributing to depression, to the biological. This presentation addresses the emergence of neuroscientific discourses concerning ‘disorders of desire’, which include alcoholism, obesity and depression and their bio-medicalization in global biopolitics. Historically speaking, these conditions have been contemplated in conjunction as described in the archival research by Marianna Valverde. Valverde describes how previous theories depicted the connections between melancholia and inebriety and argued that the biological bases for both of these conditions were similar. Specifically, Valverde outlines how in both British and French medical practices in the early 1900s there were similar approaches taken that included nutritional therapies combined with fresh air and rest, which were supposedly useful for the restoration of equilibrium in the nervous system17. Moreover, all three conditions receive extensive media coverage. In particular, emphasis will be placed upon illustrating the connections between the discourses emerging from self-help literature with the trends in the biologization of psychiatry and the promotion of neurochemical accounts of ‘disorders of desire’ in global capitalism. Moreover, by following and unpacking these threads of analysis it is possible to further explore what Martin Heidegger termed the ‘will to technology’19 within late modernity and develop a critique of the arguments that underpin the very basis for the continued popularity of the serotonin hypothesis. Contemporary labour as described in the work of Lazzarato has also evolved in our post-Fordist economy from a materialist foundation to becoming a combination of immaterial labour (specifically in First World nations) and material labour (generally Third World). This transformation has also intensified the deployment of biopolitical strategies from concerns about physical health in disciplinary societies to the entire subjectivity of workers in societies of control. As the lines of consumption and production have blurred, the processes of generation and implementation have also been blurred in the intellectual enterprises of the information age. As countries industrialize, particular classes of individuals that comprise these nations are incorporated into the intellectual proletariat and become integrated into the communications networks of the global economy. As part of the corporatization of global culture, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference and disability are no longer considered liabilities in the workforce; however, the inability to socialize and become part of the organization as a result of not embodying certain required personality traits is considered justifiable cause for dismissal. These characteristics are assumed to be possible for all individuals to develop, no matter what subjective positioning that they may occupy within the diverse social networks and publics that they may inhabit. In global capitalist culture, individuals are encouraged to seek the ‘truth’ from specialists in order to optimize all facets of their lives. In this manner, the subject is encouraged to think of all structural impediments (such as corporate culture and their own subjective positioning) as simply obstacles that the victorious self-actualized individual may counter and overcome with the ‘secrets’ of success. At the same time, the contemporary individual, which has in part been interpellated by the very discourses of techniques of the self, is also more likely to be susceptible to ‘status anxiety’21. The success that the individual achieves on a number of levels is not considered comparable to his/her peers and there is always a lack of fulfillment, which allows for the intensification of desire. The self-actualizing subject22 is a further extension of the Entrepreneurial23 subject that has been described by Deborah Lupton and Alan Petersen (or the ‘homo economius’24 as depicted by Michel Foucault). Biopolitics has moved beyond simply ensuring norms of behaviour to the privileging of personality traits that are considered necessary for achievement with an implicit directive that self-awareness, reflexivity and pharmaceutical enhancement can result in redefining the self. This is one crucial aspect of the very process of the interiorization of the individual in global capitalism as described by Gilles Deleuze in ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’ in which he extends Foucault’s concept of biopolitics and adapts it for the emergence of global capitalism. Techniques of the self in contemporary society, although operationalized on an individual level are more insidious than the regulatory disciplinary societies that emanated from particular institutions as Foucault had described. Deleuze and Guattari developed the concept of the rhizome25, which they depict as being like an interconnected system of trees, roots, tubers. This concept does offer an image as to how discourses within contemporary mediated networks operate synergistically and even though they emerge from completely different fields of knowledge are, indeed, part of the same system of logic that the contemporary subject is predicated upon. The contemporary subject in global capitalistic culture is expected to self-regulate and not to transgress prescribed pathways of desire. We are presently witnessing the extension of the ‘will to health’26, as described by Deborah Lupton that arose in the 1970s, with the global psychiatric logic of neurochemical ‘correction’ (and the trend of ‘prevention'[diagnosis]) for ‘anomalies of the will’. In this manner, the self-actualizing subject is encouraged to seek intervention from a variety of specialists (self-help texts, mental health counselors, psychiatrists, etc) to ensure optimal performance in their own vision of the pursuit of success. The very techniques for the construction of the ‘self’ in global capitalist culture also make immanent sense to the consumer in the consumption of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of ‘disorders of desire’ due to the embedded logic about choice within the construction of identity. With ‘psy’ knowledges esteemed as the authorities of the ‘truth’ about subjectivity, the promotion of the unitary self has now surpassed the film screen29 and is dominant in the bombardment of mediated messages that we encounter in our day to day lives with either a basis in psychology (or to a large extent – the pop psychology that is also infused into brand marketing). In large part, the concept of biopolitics of Foucault must be extended in order to account for the mediated environment of the contemporary consumer in global capitalism. In an interview, Maurizio Lazzarato describes the concept of publics and how these publics are one element of analysis that need to be considered with respect to biopolitics30. Specifically, in the age of mass media, information technologies and the influence of the contents of these mediums in the formation of not only publics but also the affects inspired in individuals do need to be incorporated into the analysis of how strategies of self-regulation become interiorized. At the same time, our responses to this information are not based on our alliances with these publics but our individual desires that are inspired by belonging to these publics. In addition, it also challenges the critique embedded in arguments about over-prescription and the pathologization of otherwise healthy individuals. This is one particular disconnect between actual theory production and recent scientific discoveries and their simplistic and sensationalistic38 portrayal in the media. Returning to the previous discussions about biopolitics in global capitalism, a few glaring paradoxes are readily apparent that do require some exploration. For the purpose of my argument, I would like to continue on the tangent that these disorders are epidemics of global capitalism. What is it about global capitalistic culture that might be facilitating the very social conditions for the emergence of these epidemics? The works of Martin Heidigger have once again become in vogue and his discussions about the ‘will to technology’ are often referred to in many cultural studies texts. Although, he is generally cited in combination with some very alarmist visions of our post-human future, his warnings might be more useful in terms of thinking through our trust in science and technological progress. Heidegger describes how culture in modernity incites boredom. One component of this incitement to boredom that specifically applies to global capitalism is the mistaken belief that science is able to and has discovered all ‘truth’. On a certain level, this does lead to the illusion that there is nothing new to discover and that we have access to all knowledge. With our trust in science for answers to all of our life questions, it is little wonder that The Secret42 by Rhonda Byrne with its pseudo-scientific descriptions of ‘the laws of attraction’ became such an astounding success in 2006. My preliminary discourse analysis of self-help literature from the mid-1980s reveals common themes in the individual narratives of dealing with these disorders. As a synopsis, there are two major ideas that I would like to discuss with respect to this presentation. Relating back to Heidegger’s concept of the ‘will to technology’, a worldview dominated by science and technology in which all is calculable and known does not contain hope. Narratives such as hers are excellent in for the promotion of pharmaceutical products. Moreover, in our contemporary culture we are constantly self-monitoring and self-regulating on both conscious and unconscious levels as a result of the constant bombardment of biopolitical mediated messages. It is easy to understand how symptoms become disconnected from social context even in the process of self-monitoring since it 43requires that we observe ourselves as both subject and object. In summation, neuroscientific discourses are extremely appealing for their ability to explain the complexity involved in human moods and behaviours. As outlined in this presentation, on a multitude of levels such explanations do merit further critical examination since they are disconnected from the sociality of human beings and their interconnections to not only each other, but to complex networks and information systems.

Some consider soft tyranny a phenomenon of modern societies (or of the future) because these are considered infertile grounds for hard tyranny. The thinker cited that there are those such as the Americans who overcome the danger soft tyranny by ascribing to the ideal of liberty, one that is understood as taking responsibility for one's self-governance and this tradition, for Tocqueville, allows America to avoid soft despotism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a \"natural law approach.\" The natural law approach, they said, depends upon \"exercises of faith.\" McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed: \"The abiding difficulty with the natural law approach is that its assumptions, intellectual procedures, and modalities of justification can be employed equally by the proponents of human dignity and the proponents of human indignity in support of diametrically opposed empirical specifications of rights ...\"\n\n fairness, and justice. Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government.

For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural right to life. The Belgian philosopher of law Frank Van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition.

Primary goods are subdivided in two categories: In the second edition of the Theory of Justice, primary goods are stated to be those that the citizens need as free people and as members of the society. In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be \n\n are in place to prevent overexploitation driven by market demand that can threaten the sustainability of fisheries resources, food security, and nutrition.\" Rawls (1999) outlined his ‘justice as fairness’ with two principles: that each person has the equal right\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

The movement itself was born in the late 1970s among young legal scholars at Harvard Law School who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, legal realism. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. only reflects the objective and consistently prevailing economic laws established by formal rationality. However, the conceptualizing routine of neoclassical economics differs from the genuine approach of Max Weber in that Neoclassicals focused exactly on finding and deducing economic laws (in accordance with the efforts of natural sciences), while the ideal-types of the Weberian sociology only supported the interpretative understanding of past events with no references to causal laws. The Law and economics movement has been treated by some scholars as a continuation of earlier theories of legal evolution. Developed in the middle of the 20th Century, Law and economics theorists seek to apply the methods of economic analysis to law. Elliott argues that the Law and economics movement claims to have solved the puzzle of why some legal rules survive and develop whereas others are rejected via classical economics. For instance, Clark used 'cost-reduction' to explain the force behind legal evolution in statute. John Millar proposed, for instance, that legal systems progressed from hunter gathering societies with minimal property to modern systems of international commerce. An example of the book's approach is the theories surrounding minimum wage. Classical micro-economic theory dictates that in a perfectly competitive market, raising the legal minimum wage will increase unemployment, as it prevents the hire of workers whose market value falls below the legal minimum.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

This view has been much criticized, however, on the grounds that it involves \"rule-worship\" which forbids us from performing such behaviors precisely when they are harmless or even beneficial, just because they would be less beneficial in circumstances which we know we are not in, and that an adequate response (justified by a UA test) is to follow the slightly more but not unmanageable complex rule of usually telling the truth, but lying just when doing so will definitely produce more good than telling the truth.

Another leading sociologist, Émile Durkheim, wrote in his classic work The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions. Other notable early legal sociologists included Hugo Sinzheimer, Theodor Geiger, Georges Gurvitch and Leon Petrażycki in Europe, and William Graham Sumner in the U.S.\n\n1) charismatic authority (character, heroism, leadership, religious), ; 2) traditional authority (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism) and ; 3) legal authority (modern law and state, bureaucracy). Max Weber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority. He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay The Three Types of Legitimate Rule which was published in his masterwork Economy and Society (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech \"Politics as a Vocation\" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138). According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. According to sociologist Max Weber, modern capitalist society \"arose out of the moral calling of Calvinists; more specifically, the doctrine of predestination which resulted in new tensions between the individual and society and encouraged the believer to rationalize the objectivity of his belief (his or her productive contribution to the accumulation of capital).\" Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. Weber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. \"Weber perceived bureaucratization as an efficient institutional representation of rationality in modern capitalist society, yet also recognized how this could be \"potentially dehumanizing, even malevolent, in its impersonality and possible elevation of economic efficiency and profit-maximization over human values and social justice. Weber was genuinely alarmed by the prospect that an institutionalized, morally vacuous or pernicious instrumental, and especially, formal, rationality might be used to justify morally questionable ends.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

Zanchi argues that natural law should be seen as moral knowledge that God has universally and directly “reinscribed” on the human mind after the Fall, rather than as a \"relic of the original image of God” or some “essential part of human nature.\" In jurisprudence, natural law theory refers generally to the view that links law to morality and proposes that just laws are immanent in nature and independent of the lawgiver, waiting to be discovered or found (as opposed to created by humans), usually by means of reason alone. All who have wisdom and conscience, he concludes, are able to use reason to recognize the lex naturalis, natural law. Thomism recognizes four different species of law, which he defines as \"an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated\": The development of natural law is one of the most influential parts of Thomist philosophy. Aquinas says that \"[the law \n\n to Cicero's argument. Cicero was asserting that the killing of Clodius was admissible if it was an act of self-defence. Indeed, Cicero goes as far as to say that such behaviour is instinctive (nata lex: \"an inborn law\") to all living creatures (non instituti, sed imbuti sumus: \"we are not taught [self-defence] through instruction, but through natural intuition\").\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

A minority of feminists have called for the existence of one or possibly more societies in which women would govern women and men. According to Alice Echols, \"Carol Hanisch ... argued that looking pretty and acting dumb were survival strategies which women should continue to use until such time as the 'power of unity' could replace them.\" One feminist leader, Ann Snitow, speculated that difference feminism became preferred over gender equality so that \"men might be more responsive\". In the late 18th century in Britain, Mary Wollstonecraft wrote in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman of \"[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for\". As Catharine MacKinnon (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate sexual harassment and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements. Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist jurisprudence and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal. She questioned his attempts to analyse homosexuality and prostitution in ancient Greece, and argued that his attempts to combine historical with biological and economic analysis sometimes produced inconsistent conclusions. She described his claims that men are more sexually jealous than women and that women found men likely to protect and care for their children to be their ideal of a sexual partner as false, and noted that his thesis that whenever individuals think rationally they seek to maximize their satisfactions was controversial.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.
