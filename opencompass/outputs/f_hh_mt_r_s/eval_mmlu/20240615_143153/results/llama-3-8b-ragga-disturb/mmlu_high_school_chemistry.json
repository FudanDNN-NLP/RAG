The forces that arise from attractions between transient dipoles generated by the rapid movement of electrons of all neutral atoms are known as Van der Waals forces. These fluctuations result in the formation of temporary dipoles, where one side of the atom or molecule becomes slightly more negative while the other side becomes slightly more positive. The strength of Van der Waals forces depends on several factors, including the number of electrons in an atom or molecule and the distance between interacting species. Generally, larger atoms or molecules with more electrons exhibit stronger Van der Waals forces. Despite being weak, Van der Waals forces have significant effects. In summary, Van der Waals forces arise from attractions between transient dipoles generated by the rapid movement of electrons in neutral atoms.

London theorized that attractive forces between molecules that cannot be explained by ionic or covalent interaction can be caused by polar moments within molecules.

Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. Carbon-14 is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions. Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of plutonium-244 possibly deposited by cosmic dust.

They are typically composed of ions or polar molecules that attract water molecules through electrical charge effects. Water molecules, which are polar, have an excess of electron density on the oxygen atom, creating weakly negative regions. In contrast, substances that contain mainly nonpolar bonds are usually insoluble in water and are called hydrophobic. Water molecules are not attracted to hydrophobic molecules, such as hydrocarbons, which have many C-H bonds. Ionic substances, such as sodium chloride, dissolve in water because the water molecules are attracted to the positive (Na+) or negative (Cl-) charge of each ion. Polar substances, like urea, dissolve in water because their molecules form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules. In summary, hydrophilic substances dissolve readily in water due to the attraction between water molecules and the electrical charges or polar nature of the substances. By virtue of their strongly C–H bonds (~100 kcal/mol) and C–C bonds (~90 kcal/mol, but usually less sterically accessible), they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals, although many electron-deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron-rich bonds (see below). This inertness is the source of the term paraffins (with the meaning here of \"lacking affinity\"). Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

The first step is then a substitution reaction involving the displacement of a bound water molecule by ammonia forming the tetrahedral complex [Ag(NH3)(H2O)3]+. In the second step, all the aqua ligands are lost and a linear, two-coordinate product [H3N–Ag–NH3]+ is formed. Examination of the thermodynamic data shows that the difference in entropy change is the main contributor to the difference in stability constants for the two complexation reactions. 2 VCl4 + 8 HBr  →  2 VBr3  +  8 HCl  +  Br2 Vanadium(III) bromide and molybdenum(IV) bromide were prepared by treatment of the higher chlorides with HBr.

The aqueous complex Ni(NO2)2(H2O)4 forms when an alkali metal nitrite is added to a nickel salt solution:  The complex is a much more intense emerald green colour than the Ni(H2O)62+ ion. Brooker claims that intense light photocatalyses the destruction of the ionic nitro complexes, leaving only Ni(NO2)2(H2O)4.

A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron. The largest applications for metallic antimony are an alloy with lead and tin and the lead antimony plates in lead–acid batteries. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. Antimony is a soft (MH 3.0) and brittle semi-metallic element. It is commonly regarded as a metalloid, or by some other authors as either a metal or a non-metal. It has an open-packed crystalline structure (BCN 3+3) with bonding \n\n Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is found in nature as the crystalline mineral stibnite and the amorphous red mineral (actually a mineraloid) metastibnite. Antimony is a member of group 15 of the periodic table, one of the elements called pnictogens, and has an electronegativity of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends, it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth, and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide, Sb2O3. Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metalloid with a Mohs scale hardness of 3, which is too soft to make hard objects. Antimony is resistant to attack by acids. Four allotropes of antimony are known: a \n\n (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence.

If the container expands slowly, however, so that the ideal gas pressure law holds at any time, gas molecules lose energy at the rate that they do work on the expanding wall. The amount of work they do is the pressure times the area of the wall times the outward displacement, which is the pressure times the change in the volume of the gas: Since the specific heat of a monatomic gas is 3/2, this is the same as the thermodynamic formula for the entropy. Thus, the internal pressure of the air was apparently equal to zero and the air acted as a perfect gas. By the middle of the seventeenth century Robert Boyle had derived the inverse relationship between the pressure and the volume of gases. During that time there were efforts to liquefy gases. For example, early in the nineteenth century Cagniard de la Tour showed there was a temperature above which a gas could not be liquefied. There \n\n Joule performed his experiment with air at room temperature which was expanded from a pressure of about 22 bar. It takes place in an adiabatic system consisting of a gas and two rigid vessels (a and b) of equal volume, connected by a valve. Vessel (a) contains the gas under high pressure while the other vessel (b) is empty. The volume, taken by the gas, is doubled while the internal energy of the system is constant (adiabatic and no work done). Assuming that the gas is ideal the molar internal energy is given by Um = CVT.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

They include cations which have a net positive charge, and anions which have a net negative charge. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus; thus, they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations. The alkalides are an exception: they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a −1 oxidation state, which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides, the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.

Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of s. However, only two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital. Typically, the filling of superatomic orbitals does not follow Hund's rule, which states that electrons occupy separate orbitals of the same energy before pairing up. quantum number, s, which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, (n, ℓ, m), these two electrons must differ in their spin. Thus the n = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In argon, the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty. When two nearby atoms have unpaired electrons, whether the electron spins are parallel or antiparallel affects whether the electrons can share the same orbit as a result of the quantum mechanical effect called the exchange interaction. The exchange interaction is related to the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two electrons with the same spin cannot also be in the same spatial state (orbital). This is a consequence of the spin-statistics theorem and that electrons are fermions. Therefore, under certain conditions, when the orbitals of the unpaired outer valence electrons from adjacent atoms overlap, the distributions of their electric charge in space are farther apart\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

All alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.

Hydrogen's electronegativity value of 2.2 is less than the electronegativity of the atoms that hydrogen is commonly bound to, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, or fluorine. For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO), for which Ka1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO), wherein the Ka2 is intermediate strength. The large Ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO) and lose \n\nAn oxoacid is an acid which contains oxygen. It was later discovered that some acids, notably hydrochloric acid, did not contain oxygen and so a distinction was made for those that did. Common oxoacids include:\nHalogen oxoacids: Hypochlorous acid; Chlorous acid; Chloric acid; Perchloric acid; Perbromic acid; Metaperiodic acid\nSulfuric acid\nNitric acid\nPhosphoric acid\nCommon acids which are not oxoacids include:\nHydrochloric acid\nHydrofluoric acid\nHydrobromic acid\nHydroiodic acid\nAlthough carboxylic acids fulfill the criteria above, they are not generally considered as oxoacids. All oxoacids have the acidic hydrogen bound to an oxygen atom, so bond strength (length) is not a factor as it is with binary nonmetal hydrides. Rather, the electronegativity of the central atom (E) and the number of O atoms determine oxoacid acidity. With the same number of oxygens around E, acid strength increases with the electronegativity of E.\n\nThe acidity of oxoacids is determined by the electronegativity of the central atom (E) and the number of oxygen atoms attached to it. According to the reference text, all oxoacids have an acidic hydrogen bound to an oxygen atom. In general, as the electronegativity of the central atom increases, the acidity of the oxoacid also increases. This means that if two oxoacids have the same number of oxygen atoms attached to them, the one with a more electronegative central atom will be more acidic. Additionally, increasing the number of oxygen atoms around the central atom can also increase the acidity of an oxoacid. It's important to note that carboxylic acids are not typically considered as oxoacids, even though they fulfill some criteria mentioned earlier.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

The electron density is concentrated around the fluorine, leaving the carbon relatively electron poor. Carbon–fluorine bonds can have a bond dissociation energy (BDE) of up to 130 kcal/mol. For example, the BDEs of the C-X bond within a CH3-X molecule is 115, 104.9, 83.7, 72.1, and 57.6 kcal/mol for X = fluorine, hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, respectively. Gaseous beryllium fluoride adopts a linear structure, with a Be-F distance of 143 pm. BeF2 reaches a vapor pressure of 10 Pa at 686 °C, 100 Pa at 767 °C, 1 kPa at 869 °C, 10 kPa at 999 °C, and 100 kPa at 1172 °C. 'Molecules' of liquid beryllium fluoride have a fluctuating tetrahedral structure. Additionally, the density of liquid BeF2 decreases near its freezing point, as Be2+ and F− ions begin to coordinate more strongly with one another, leading to the expansion of voids between formula units. Hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine. While hydrogen bonding is stronger than other types of dipole-dipole interactions, it is still weaker than covalent bonding. While Van der Waals forces can contribute to the overall stability of a molecule, they are considerably weaker than covalent bonds. Electrostatic bonds, also known as ionic bonds, occur when there is a transfer of electrons between atoms, resulting in the formation of positive and negative ions that are attracted to each other. Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom is attracted to a highly electronegative atom (such as oxygen or nitrogen) in a different molecule. The carbon–fluorine bond is a polar covalent bond between carbon and fluorine that is a component of all organofluorine compounds. The bond also strengthens and shortens as more fluorines are added to the same carbon on a chemical compound. As such, fluoroalkanes like tetrafluoromethane (carbon tetrafluoride) are some of the most unreactive organic compounds.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

During the dissociation process, the C-Br and C-Cl bond lengths were asymmetrically elongated, with the C-Br bond breaking first and a new Br-Cl bond emerging while the C-Cl bond continued to exist for a while. As a result, an asynchronous concerted elimination mechanism was favored for BrCl+ detachment. ; Bromine monofluoride (BrF) has not been obtained as a pure compound — it dissociates into the trifluoride and free bromine.

At 32.5 K (just below the boiling point of ) and 15 atm, the maximum molar concentration of dissolved N2 is 0.\n\n temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent.

As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. Comparison of the physical properties of NH3 with those of water shows NH3 has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, viscosity, dielectric constant and electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH3 and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH3 molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H2O moleculeGive.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

The most abundant buffer in the ECF consists of a solution of carbonic acid (H2CO3), and the bicarbonate salt of, usually, sodium (Na+). Thus, when there is an excess of ions in the solution carbonic acid partially neutralizes them by forming H2O and bicarbonate  ions. Similarly an excess of H+ ions is partially neutralized by the bicarbonate component of the buffer solution to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which, because it is a weak acid, remains largely in the undissociated form, releasing far fewer H+ ions into the solution than the original \n\n acid would have done. The higher the concentration of the weak acid in the solution (compared to the weak base) the lower the resulting pH of the solution. Similarly, if the weak base predominates the higher the resulting pH. For the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, a molar ratio of weak acid to weak base of 1:20 produces a pH of 7.4; and vice versa—when the pH of the extracellular fluids is 7.4 then the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate ions in that fluid is 1:20.\n\n dissociation constant Ka is generally used in the context of acid–base reactions. operate by making changes to the buffers, each of which consists of two components: a weak acid and its conjugate base. It is the ratio concentration of the weak acid to its conjugate base that determines the pH of the solution. The bicarbonate buffer, consisting of a mixture of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and a bicarbonate salt in solution, is the most abundant buffer in the extracellular fluid, and it is also the buffer whose acid to base ratio can be changed very easily and rapidly.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

For a spontaneous chemical process in a closed system at constant temperature and pressure without non-PV work, the Clausius inequality ΔS > Q/Tsurr transforms into a condition for the change in Gibbs free energy \n\n also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, one assumes that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. If analysis indicates a positive ΔG for a reaction, then energy — in the form of electrical or other non-PV work — would have to be added to the reacting system for ΔG to be smaller than the non-PV work and make it possible for the reaction to occur. This indicates that the reactants have a higher free energy than the products, and as a result, energy will be released during the course of the reaction. In summary, a negative change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) in STP reacting systems signifies that a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, releasing energy. Reference:\n- Adapted from reference text\n\nThe ΔG of a reaction is influenced by the concentration of reactants and products. When ΔG is negative, the reaction proceeds spontaneously from reactants to products, indicating a net loss of energy and an exergonic reaction. Conversely, when ΔG is positive, the reaction does not occur spontaneously, and energy must be added to drive the reaction in the reverse direction, indicating an endergonic reaction. When ΔG is zero, the reaction is in equilibrium. The relationship between reactant and product concentrations and ΔG can be described using the equation ΔG = ΔG° + RTln(Q), where ΔG° is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient. This indicates a non-spontaneous reaction that requires energy input to proceed. In summary, the concentration of reactants and products affects the ΔG of a reaction by altering the value of the reaction quotient, which determines whether the reaction is spontaneous or requires energy input. By understanding this relationship, we can better comprehend the thermodynamics of chemical reactions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

These bonds are formed when atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, typically by filling their valence shell. In comparison, hydrogen bonds are relatively weaker. They occur when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine) and is attracted to another electronegative atom in a different molecule. These interactions are weaker than covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. These interactions arise due to temporary fluctuations in electron distribution that induce the formation of temporary dipoles. While individually weak, these forces collectively contribute to intermolecular attractions, especially in nonpolar molecules. To summarize, the strongest type of interaction among covalent, hydrogen, electrostatic, and Van der Waals is the covalent bond. Chemical polarity refers to how equally bonding electrons are shared between atoms in a compound. It is a physical property that can affect various other physical properties, such as solubility, melting points, and boiling points. Polarity also influences intermolecular forces. Intermolecular forces are influenced by chemical polarity as well. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond. If there is a significant difference in electronegativity between atoms within a compound, such as in water (H2O), then it will result in an uneven sharing of electrons and make the molecule polar. On the other hand, non-polar compounds like methane (CH4) have similar electronegativities for all their constituent atoms, resulting in equal sharing of electrons and no separation of charge across the molecule. In summary, chemical polarity describes how bonding electrons are shared between atoms in a compound. Polarity also influences intermolecular forces, with polar compounds exhibiting dipole-dipole interactions. The difference in electronegativity between atoms and the structural asymmetry of a compound determine its polarity. The polarity is due to the electronegativity of the atom of oxygen: oxygen is more electronegative than the atoms of hydrogen, so the electrons they share through the covalent bonds are more often close to oxygen rather than hydrogen. These are called polar covalent bonds, covalent bonds between atoms that thus become oppositely charged.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy investigates the vibrational modes of the reaction intermediates. ESI-MS is used to identify and characterize the transient species formed during the reaction. Crystallographic characterization techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and neutron diffraction, can also be employed to determine the precise molecular structure of the reaction intermediates. By employing these spectroscopic, electrochemical, and crystallographic characterization techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the reaction intermediates formed during the chlorination of alkanes with NaOCl catalyzed by a nickel complex, leading to valuable insights into the mechanistic aspects of the reaction. +  HOCl +  + ; HOCl + →  +  + 2 HOCl + →  +  + 2 A useful rule in the determination of mechanism is that the concentration factors in the rate law indicate the composition and charge of the activated complex or transition state. For the –CO reaction above, the rate depends on []2, so that the activated complex has composition, with 2 entering the reaction before the transition state, and CO reacting after the transition state. A multistep example is the reaction between oxalic acid and chlorine in aqueous solution: +  → 2  + 2  + 2. The observed rate law is which implies an activated complex in which the reactants lose 2 + before the rate-determining step. One possible mechanism in which the preliminary steps are assumed to be rapid pre-equilibria occurring prior to the transition state is\n\n a simple example in the gas phase, the reaction 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3 can be catalyzed by adding nitric oxide. The reaction mechanism occurs in two steps: The overall reaction is the first equation plus twice the second reaction, so that the NO catalyst is regenerated and does not participate in the net reaction. The overall rate is the rate of the slow step As an example of a detailed mechanism for heterogeneous catalysis at a surface, when oxygen and hydrogen combine on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2, or titania) to produce water. Scanning tunneling microscopy showed that the molecules undergo adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion before reacting. The intermediate reaction states were: HO2, H2O2, then H3O2 and the final reaction product (water molecule dimers), after which the water molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface. Unlike abiotic reactions, enzymatic reactions occur through a series of steps, including substrate-enzyme binding, conversion of substrate to product, and dissociation of enzyme-product complex. If the step that converts substrate to product is rate limiting, the enzyme will express its intrinsic isotope effect, that of the bond forming or breaking reaction.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.

Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. Those with mass 5 decay to helium-4 and a proton or a neutron, and those with mass 8 decay to two helium-4 nuclei; their half-lives (helium-5, lithium-5, and beryllium-8) are very short, unlike the half-lives for all other such nuclides with A ≤ 209, which are very long. Working out the details of the theory leads to an equation relating the half-life of a radioisotope to the decay energy of its alpha particles, a theoretical derivation of the empirical Geiger–Nuttall law. In particle physics and nuclear physics, the branching fraction (or branching ratio) for a decay is the fraction of particles which decay by an individual decay mode with respect to the total number of particles which decay. Sometimes a partial half-life is given, but this term is misleading; due to competing modes it is not true that half of the particles will decay through a particular decay mode after its partial half-life. decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry. However, if the probability of escape at each collision is very small, the half-life of the radioisotope will be very long, since it is the time required for the total probability of escape to reach 50%.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school chemistry.
