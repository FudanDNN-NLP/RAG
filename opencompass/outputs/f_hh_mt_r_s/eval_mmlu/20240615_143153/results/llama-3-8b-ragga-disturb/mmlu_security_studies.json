The geopolitics of climate change is complex. It has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves. For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions. Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell. With rising concerns over non-renewable energy source usage and climate change caused by carbon emissions, the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles is becoming more and more important to the conversation of sustainability. Such urban transport systems should consist of rail transport, electric buses, bicycle pathways, provision for human-powered transport and pedestrian walkways. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. Even within the PV plant \n\nUnfortunately, the recent surge of pulmonary plague in Madagascar is not unique. Despite major improvements in sanitation, exposure reduction, and treatment access, infectious diseases remain a necessary focus of public health systems. In the past five years, the world has seen a succession of infectious disease epidemics―among them the emergence and expansion of Middle East respiratory syndrome, highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N9), Ebola and Zika viruses, which have affected health systems on almost every continent. Together zoonoses cause well over a billion human infections and a million deaths per year, plus significant impacts on livestock production, food security, and livelihoods, and often extending to tourism, trade, travel, environmental conservation, education, and more. Given such wide-ranging impacts and the close connections between human, animal and environmental health, public health systems can benefit from a multi-sectoral, “One Health” approach that promotes coordination to better understand and manage risks. The World Bank has a long history of bridging its expertise and investments across sectors for strong public health systems, first, when it tackled river blindness in Africa in the 70s and, more recently, to address the avian influenza crisis. For example, the World Bank’s Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement project (REDISSE) is supporting surveillance and epidemic preparedness in West Africa, building in measurable indicators to advance veterinary and public health capacity. In line with this, the new Operational Framework for Strengthening Human, Animal and Environmental Public Health Systems at their Interface (“One Health Operational Framework”) provides guidance to support countries in optimizing their One Health efforts and outcomes. While not all public health threats require a One Health approach, countries need strong human, animal, and environmental health/management systems and coordination between them to determine which sectors are relevant for understanding and managing risk. It can optimize pandemic preparedness planning and enhance climate change vulnerability assessments. Planning for disease events and maintaining strong multi-sector coordination channels helps ensure consistent and effective messaging to manage risk, enhance efficiency, and promote credibility of all sectors. In addition to infectious diseases, approaches outlined in the One Health Operational Framework can be applied to address other health hazards at the human-animal-environment interface, such as pollution, climate change, food insecurity, and more. For example, the recent use of a climate change and health diagnostic in Madagascar shows that climate change is already impacting health, that this damage is likely to continue, and that recent development gains are likely to be reversed without adequate investment in health sector resilience, with serious consequences for people and the environment. Land degradation, another example of weak environmental health, can affect disaster resilience, safe water and food supplies, and pest control. Strong coordination at the human-animal-environment interface can support multi-hazard preparedness to address existing threats and be flexible enough to anticipate threats on the horizon. By working across sectors to strengthen overall public health systems, we can reduce risks and help maximize healthy, long-term and sustainable development. The nature of threat posed requires the kind of collaboration that the WBG does best -- analytical and evidence-driven, multidimensional, public-private, veterinary health and public health.

These ties have occasionally led to calls for greater \n\n Some academics argue that International Resource Privilege remains because arrangements between global institutions tend to be struck without adequate concern for their thoroughgoing effects on the global poor. One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime. There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it. The Washington Post quotes Thomas Pogge as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” We elect officials that let the corporations buy the natural resources that should belong to the people is the argument for why we are involved. For example oil wealth and dictatorship go together as seen in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. This international economic and political system perpetuates and reproduces poverty in such that western nations have a negative duty not to do harm to the people of these nations. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values. On 8 June 2017, gas futures spiked nearly 4 percent in the United Kingdom, which had nearly a third of all its imported gas arriving from Qatar.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\nB. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\nC. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\nD.

Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse. However, others have argued that this very argument is used in order to downplay human rights abuses. More recently, the emergence of human security – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development. Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies. However, Uriel Abulof argues that empirical studies on securitization have been \"insufficiently attentive to societies engulfed in profound existential uncertainty about their own survival.\" Nevertheless, it is a top priority in security discourses. \"If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem.

While drug policies are generally implemented by governments, entities at all levels (from international organisations, national or local government, administrations, or private places) may have specific policies related to drugs. Drug policies are usually aimed at combatting drug addiction or dependence addressing both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as mitigating the harms of drug use, and providing medical assistance and treatment. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Policies that help mitigate the dangers of drug use include needle syringe programs, drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity. For example, heroin is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as khat, codeine, or alcohol are regulated in some places, but not others. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \"drug policy\". International drug control treaties\n\nHistory \nThe first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance was adopted at the Brussels Conference in 1890 in the context of the regulations against slave trade, and concerned alcoholic beverages. It was followed by the final act of the Shanghai Opium Commission of 1909 which attempted to settle peace and arrange the trade in opium, after the opium wars in the 19th Century. In 1912 at the First International Opium Conference held in the Hague, the multilateral International Opium Convention was adopted; it ultimately got incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A number of international treaties related to drugs followed in subsequent decades: the 1925 Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium (which introduced some restrictions—but no total prohibition—on the export of \"Indian hemp\" pure extracts), the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs and Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East, the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, among others. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use. Countries commit to \"protecting the health and welfare of [hu]mankind\" and to combat substance abuse and addiction. The treaty is not a self-enforcing agreement: countries have to pass their own legislation aligned with the framework of the Convention. Contrary to common beliefs, these treaties have not particularly been influenced by the United States in their drafting, but rather by countries like France, the United Kingdom, South Africa or Egypt. Their implementation, however, has been led by the USA, in particular after the Nixon administration's declaration of \"War on drugs\" in 1971 and the creation of the DEA in 1973. Current treaties \nThe core drug control treaties currently in force internationally are:\n\n the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (1961 Convention or Single Convention) composed of:\n the original Single Convention concluded at New York (United States), 30 March 1961, and\n its amendement, the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs which was adopted in Geneva (Switzerland), 25 March 1972,\n the Convention on psychotropic substances (1971 Convention), concluded at Vienna, 21 February 1971, and\n the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988 Convention) concluded at Vienna (Austria), 20 December 1988. There are other treaties that address drugs under international control, such as:\n\n the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), concluded on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica),\n the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), concluded on 20 November 1989 in New York City,\n the International Convention Against Doping in Sport concluded in Paris (France) on 19 October 2005. Additionally, other pieces of international law enter into play, like the international human rights treaties protecting the right to health or the rights of indigenous peoples, and, in the case of plants considered as drug crops (coca plant, cannabis, opium poppy), treaties protecting the right to land, farmers' of peasants' rights, and treaties on plant genetic resources or traditional knowledge. Treaty-mandated organizations \nThere are four bodies mandated under the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988):\n\n The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a subsidiary body of the United Nations ECOSOC, the CND is acting as a conference of the Parties to the three core Conventions,\n the UN Secretary-General, whose mandate is de facto carried on by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),\n the World Health Organization (WHO), in charge of the scientific review of substances for inclusion under, changes in, or withdrawal from control (scheduling assessment),\n the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the treaty-body monitoring implementation and collecting statistical data. Drug policy by country\n\nAustralia \n\nAustralian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. Bolivia \nLike Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. Canada\n\nColombia \n\nUnder President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. However, possession and trafficking of drugs are still illegal. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \"smuggler pardon\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. Germany \n\nCompared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\"BtmG\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India\n\nIndonesia \nLike many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Netherlands \n\nDrug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. Sweden \n\nSweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement. The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time. Switzerland\nThe national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem. Ukraine\nCrimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327. According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\". On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. This policy on drugs, known as the \"British system\", was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy\nThe director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \"War on Drugs\":\n\nThe U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control. It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.

We will lose one of the few remaining vulnerabilities of the worst criminals and terrorists upon which law enforcement depends to successfully investigate and often prevent the worst crimes. For this reason, the law enforcement community is unanimous in calling for a balanced solution to this problem.\" A drug policy is the policy regarding the control and regulation of psychoactive substances (commonly referred to as drugs), particularly those that are addictive or cause physical and mental dependence.

After World War II, a series of Protocols signed at Lake Success brought into the mandate of the newly-created United Nations these pre-war treaties which had been handled by the League of Nations and the Office International d'Hygiène Publique. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use.

Their implementation, however, has been led by the USA, in particular after the Nixon administration's declaration of \"War on drugs\" in 1971 and the creation of the DEA in 1973. Current treaties \nThe core drug control treaties currently in force internationally are:\n\n the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (1961 Convention or Single Convention) composed of:\n the original Single Convention concluded at New York (United States), 30 March 1961, and\n its amendement, the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs which was adopted in Geneva (Switzerland), 25 March 1972,\n the Convention on psychotropic substances (1971 Convention), concluded at Vienna, 21 February 1971, and\n the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988 Convention) concluded at Vienna (Austria), 20 December 1988. There are other treaties that address drugs under international control, such as:\n\n the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), concluded on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica),\n the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), concluded on 20 November 1989 in New York City,\n the International Convention Against Doping in Sport concluded in Paris (France) on 19 October 2005. Additionally, other pieces of international law enter into play, like the international human rights treaties protecting the right to health or the rights of indigenous peoples, and, in the case of plants considered as drug crops (coca plant, cannabis, opium poppy), treaties protecting the right to land, farmers' of peasants' rights, and treaties on plant genetic resources or traditional knowledge. Treaty-mandated organizations \nThere are four bodies mandated under the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988):\n\n The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a subsidiary body of the United Nations ECOSOC, the CND is acting as a conference of the Parties to the three core Conventions,\n the UN Secretary-General, whose mandate is de facto carried on by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),\n the World Health Organization (WHO), in charge of the scientific review of substances for inclusion under, changes in, or withdrawal from control (scheduling assessment),\n the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the treaty-body monitoring implementation and collecting statistical data. Drug policy by country\n\nAustralia \n\nAustralian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. Bolivia \nLike Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. Canada\n\nColombia \n\nUnder President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. However, possession and trafficking of drugs are still illegal. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \"smuggler pardon\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. Germany \n\nCompared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\"BtmG\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India\n\nIndonesia \nLike many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Netherlands \n\nDrug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. Sweden \n\nSweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement. The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time. Switzerland\nThe national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem. Ukraine\nCrimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327. According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\". On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. This policy on drugs, known as the \"British system\", was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy\nThe director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \"War on Drugs\":\n\nThe U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control. It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.

While drug policies are generally implemented by governments, entities at all levels (from international organisations, national or local government, administrations, or private places) may have specific policies related to drugs. Drug policies are usually aimed at combatting drug addiction or dependence addressing both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as mitigating the harms of drug use, and providing medical assistance and treatment. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Policies that help mitigate the dangers of drug use include needle syringe programs, drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity. For example, heroin is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as khat, codeine, or alcohol are regulated in some places, but not others. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \"drug policy\". International drug control treaties\n\nHistory \nThe first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance was adopted at the Brussels Conference in 1890 in the context of the regulations against slave trade, and concerned alcoholic beverages. It was followed by the final act of the Shanghai Opium Commission of 1909 which attempted to settle peace and arrange the trade in opium, after the opium wars in the 19th Century. In 1912 at the First International Opium Conference held in the Hague, the multilateral International Opium Convention was adopted; it ultimately got incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A number of international treaties related to drugs followed in subsequent decades: the 1925 Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium (which introduced some restrictions—but no total prohibition—on the export of \"Indian hemp\" pure extracts), the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs and Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East, the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, among others. After World War II, a series of Protocols signed at Lake Success brought into the mandate of the newly-created United Nations these pre-war treaties which had been handled by the League of Nations and the Office International d'Hygiène Publique. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use. Countries commit to \"protecting the health and welfare of [hu]mankind\" and to combat substance abuse and addiction. The treaty is not a self-enforcing agreement: countries have to pass their own legislation aligned with the framework of the Convention. Contrary to common beliefs, these treaties have not particularly been influenced by the United States in their drafting, but rather by countries like France, the United Kingdom, South Africa or Egypt.

Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\nA. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Economic reform has been extensive. Preparations for privatization and/or sector liberalization are underway for the remaining parastatals, including telecommunications, electricity, water service, airports, ports, and the railroads. Additionally, customs duties have been reduced, and customs management has been streamlined and reformed. The government introduced a highly successful value-added tax in 1999 as part of its efforts to increase domestic revenues. Plans for 2001-02 include Commercial Code reform; comprehensive judicial reform; financial sector strengthening; continued civil service reform; improved government budget, audit, and inspection capability; and introduction of the private management of water systems in major cities.

At the same time, he advanced a new structural constructivist theory of the identity and representational field as a workable methodology towards a critical understanding of interactive relations between structure and agency under the impact of culture and ideology as political and normative instruments of power and hegemony. While modernist critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with \"forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and corporate capitalism as a political-economic system\", postmodern critical theory politicizes social problems \"by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings.\" Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge. Theories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism.

In either case, the working hypothesis is generally that policy is chiefly based on the pursuit, possession and application of power (see also power politics). It was first outlined by Kenneth Waltz in his 1979 book Theory of International Politics. Alongside neoliberalism, neorealism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives dominated international relations theory from the 1960s to the 1990s. The goal of liberal internationalism is to achieve global structures within the international system that are inclined towards promoting a liberal world order. It foresees a gradual transformation of world politics from anarchy to common institutions and the rule of law. To that extent, global free trade, liberal economics and liberal political systems are all encouraged. Once realized, it will result in a 'peace dividend', as liberal states have relations that are characterized by non-violence, and that relations between democracies are characterized by the democratic peace theory. Liberal internationalism states that, through multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, it is possible to avoid the worst excesses of \"power politics\" in relations between nations. In addition, liberal internationalists believe that the best way to spread democracy is to treat all states equally and cooperatively, whether they are initially democratic or not. According to Abrahamsen, liberal internationalism provides more opportunities to middle powers to advance their economic, security, and political interests. Kant and the liberal school of thought state that international co-operation is a more rational option for states than resorting to war. It is critical of both liberal and realists approaches to the study of international relations which, Wendt argues, emphasize materialist and individualistic motivations for state actions rather than norms and shared values as Wendt argues they should.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism. Securitization studies aims to understand \"who securitizes (securitizing actor), on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions.\" \"If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem. Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. While it does employ various ethnographic data-gathering tools, techniques, analytical approaches, and theories, it requires a specific \"anthropological sensibility\" that distinguishes it from the procedures of normal science. To illustrate these points, a group of Techno-Anthropology students at Aalborg University conducted problem-based project work. They followed the work of a group of porters and used anthropological concepts and research strategies to gain crucial insights into the potential effects of using tracking technologies in a hospital. Even professors who advocate securitization for issues such as climate change, such as Anatol Lieven, agree that securitizing an issue can cause an overreaction by state actors, for example with the War on terror and even more so with the \"war\" on drugs and crime. Regarding the securitization of migration, researcher Ainhoa Ruiz Benedicto warns of the adverse effects for forcibly displaced persons: \"In this context of securitisation of border regions, population movement is understood and treated as a suspicious activity that needs to be controlled, monitored and registered, while the migration of often forcibly displaced people and refugees is seen as a security threat that must be intercepted.\" The field of social studies of science (STS) can contribute to defending proper scientific knowledge without succumbing to scientism, particularly in relation to health issues, through its critical approach and emphasis on examining the claims of authority made by science. Instead of blindly accepting scientific claims of authority, STS challenges these claims and encourages a thorough examination of the underlying assumptions, biases, and social contexts. By doing so, it helps to ensure that proper scientific knowledge is based on robust evidence, transparent methodologies, and ethical considerations. Moreover, the critical stance of STS does not undermine the value of scientific knowledge but rather helps to refine and define what constitutes proper scientific knowledge. Through its interdisciplinary nature, STS incorporates insights from various social science disciplines, such as sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, to offer a comprehensive understanding of science and its impact on society. It should continuously reflect on its own assumptions and methodologies to maintain its critical integrity. In conclusion, the field of social studies of science contributes to defending proper scientific knowledge without succumbing to scientism by critically examining the claims of authority made by science, identifying potential flaws or limitations, and providing a comprehensive understanding of science in its social context.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

However, contrary to defensive realism, offensive realism regards states as aggressive power maximizers and not as security maximizers.

Although both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete for power, defensive realism posits that most states seek a status quo and limit themselves to concentrate on maintaining the balance of power.

Waltz argues that contemporary geopolitics exists in a state \n\n Realism's position is that ethics are secondary, or inapplicable to the affairs of international politics and believes in the primacy of self-interest over moral principle.

These challenges arise from the long-term legacies of civil war economies, which are often characterized by widespread illicit economic activities and the proliferation of criminal and quasi-criminal networks. There are three prevailing approaches to address these challenges in peace processes: criminalization, co-option, and neglect. It aims to disrupt the power and influence of these networks and promote the rule of law. This approach recognizes the influence and power of these actors and seeks to channel their activities towards legal and productive means. While this approach may bring short-term stability and cooperation, it also carries the risk of legitimizing criminal activities and undermining the rule of law. It is important to note that there is no clear consensus on which approach is most likely to succeed, and most countries will require a balanced combination of all three approaches. Addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic dynamics at play, as well as the political and cultural context of the conflict-affected country. In conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a multifaceted approach that combines criminalization, co-option, and neglect strategies. This criticism can be represented by neo-conservative proponent Richard Perle, that one must \"decontextualise terror ... any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it. While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist Phillip Zimbardo (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a Fundamental Attribution Error: \"the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables\". The notion of human needs driving violence \n\nSome factors that indicate the world's seriousness in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 include peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance. However, according to the 2018 Global Peace Index, global peacefulness has declined for the fourth consecutive year, indicating increased political instability worldwide. Moreover, regions that enjoy sustained levels of peace, security, and prosperity are more likely to make progress towards the SDGs. To assess the world's seriousness in achieving the SDGs, it is essential to evaluate whether sufficient measures are being taken to promote peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance. Strengthening international cooperation, addressing root causes of conflicts, promoting diplomacy, and ensuring respect for human rights are some steps that can demonstrate commitment towards the SDGs. Securitization in international relations and national politics is the process of state actors transforming subjects from regular political issues into matters of \"security\": thus enabling extraordinary means to be used in the name of security. Securitization theorists assert that successfully securitized subjects receive disproportionate amounts of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects causing more human damage. A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism.

Lieven argues that securitisation would be especially helpful with climate change as it would enable more military experts to speak out on the subject, with military officers being the one type of expert that conservatives tend to widely respect. On the other hand, the Transnational Institute argues in a Primer on Climate Security that \"framing the climate crisis as a security issue is deeply problematic as it ultimately reinforces a militarised approach to climate change that is likely to deepen the injustices for those most affected by the unfolding crisis. The danger of security solutions is that, by definition, they seek to secure what exists–an unjust status quo.\" A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD.

One of the reasons to seek unification to a stronger state besides a common threat can be a situation of negligence or ignorance on behalf of the weak state which is, to simplify it, desperate and almost derelict. According to Ryan Griffiths, all instances of mutually willful unification from 1816 onwards were between states that spoke the same languages. Structural realism holds that the nature of the international structure is defined by its ordering principle (anarchy), units of the system (states), and by the distribution of capabilities (measured by the number of great powers within the international system), with only the last being considered an independent variable with any meaningful change over time. The anarchic ordering principle of the international structure is decentralized, meaning there is no formal central authority; every sovereign state is formally equal in this system.

Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital was focused on one particular strand of theorizing, namely the Subaltern Studies collective. Chibber took Subaltern Studies as a representative of the key sociological and historical arguments in postcolonial studies. His basic argument in the book is that, even though postcolonial theory advertises itself as a critique of Orientalism and Eurocentrism, in fact the theory ends up resurrecting them. In other words, postcolonial theory gives new life to Orientalist notions of the Global South, by presenting a highly exoticized and essentialized understanding of it – as fundamentally different from the West, incapable of being understood by Western categories, its people untouched by reason and rationality, etc. They examine this practice as part of the systematic oppression of imperialism in neocolonial societies, and they investigate its ramifications on the psychological, physical, and cultural well-being of colonized peoples. Some post-colonial theorists advocate, if not a complete abandonment of the English language, at least a conscious \n\nApplying postcolonial theory to our understanding of old age can provide valuable insights and challenge traditional perspectives on the later stages of life. Postcolonial theory, with its focus on positional difference, subalternity, and the influence of hegemonic powers, can help move beyond a purely chronological or individualized understanding of old age. By incorporating postcolonial theory, we can examine how power dynamics and structural inequalities shape the experiences of elderly individuals. Just as postcolonial theory has shed light on the oppression and marginalization of colonized peoples, it can also illuminate the ways in which aging individuals may be marginalized or excluded by dominant societal narratives. Postcolonial theory encourages us to question traditional perspectives on old age and challenge the influence of hegemonic norms that may devalue or dismiss the experiences of the elderly. However, it's important to note that postcolonial theory may have blind spots, such as alleged culturalism. In summary, applying postcolonial theory to the study of old age can deepen our understanding by highlighting structural inequalities, power dynamics, and the influence of hegemonic norms. But the colonial ethnographers choose to coalesce several such low-ranking occupational sub-castes into one caste, without taking the regional variations into account and assigned a fixed social rank to of all Namasudra-Chandals, (something which Bernard Cohn later described as the \"objectification\" of colonial culture) and falsely stereotyped the entire community as universally despised.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. People who identify as nonbinary or gender queer show increased risk for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. People who identify as transgender demonstrate increased risk for depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Some gender-specific risk factors that disproportionately affect women are income inequality, low social ranking, unrelenting child care, gender-based violence, and socioeconomic disadvantages. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Factors that contribute to the gender disproportionality of eating disorders are perceptions surrounding \"thinness\" in relation to success and sexual attractiveness and social pressures from mass media that are largely targeted towards women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Gender differences in mental health within the LGBTQ+ community\n\nRisk factors and the minority stress model \nThe minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. Some factors identified: the history of psychiatry with conflating sexual and gender identities with psychiatric symptomatology; medical community's history of labelling gender identities such as homosexuality as an illness (now removed from the DSM); the presence of gender dysphoria in the DSM-V; prejudice and rejection from physicians and healthcare providers; LGBTQ+ underrepresentation in research populations; physicians' reluctance to ask patients about their gender; and the presence of laws against the LGBTQ+ community in many countries. General patterns such as the prevalence of minority stress have been broadly studied. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. Compared to LGBTQ+ youth with highly accepting families, LGBTQ+ youth with less accepting families are more than three times likely to consider and attempt suicide. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Transgender individuals are at the greatest risk of suicide attempts. One-third of transgender individuals (both in youth and adulthood) has seriously considered suicide and one-fifth of transgender youth has attempted suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. Lesbian and bisexual youth have a higher percentage of substance use problems as compared to sexual minority males and heterosexual females. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Transgender individuals are significantly more likely than any other LGBTQ+ demographic to report an eating disorder diagnosis or compensatory behaviour related to eating. Transgender individuals may use weight restriction to suppress secondary sex characteristics or to suppress or stress gendered features. Conflicting studies have struggled to ascertain whether LGBTQ+ people of colour experience similar or varying rates of eating disorder proneness or diagnosis. Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. Sexual violence increasingly impact adolescent girls who are subjected to forced sex, rape and sexual assault. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse are likely to impact a women's mental health on a short and long-term basis. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. Gender bias in medicine \nThe World Health Organization notes gender differentials in both the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Gender bias observed in diagnostic and healthcare systems (including as related to under-diagnosis, over-diagnosis, and misdiagnosis) is detrimental to the treatment and health of people of all genders. The difference in diagnosis emerges at an early age, with diagnostic rates for children diverging on the basis of gender once children reach school age. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Diagnostic processes may be influenced by knowledge of a patient's sex or gender alone, and male and female patients may receive different diagnoses even when presenting the same symptoms. Misogynistic Bias in Medicine \nMisogynistic bias has impacted diagnosis and treatment of men and women alike throughout the history of psychiatry, and those disparities persist today. The diagnosis was used as a form of social labeling to discourage women from venturing outside of their role, that is a tool to take control over the increasing emancipation of women. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Socioeconomic status (SES) \nSocioeconomic Status is a global term which refers to a person's income level, education and position in society. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Gender disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) \nSES is a key factor in determining one's opportunities and quality of life. Inequities in wealth and quality of life for women are known to exist both locally and globally. According to a 2015 survey of the U.S Census Bureau, in the United States, women's poverty rates are higher than men's. Indeed, for a same level of education and an equivalent field of occupation, men earn a higher wage than women. Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". The impact of gender disparities in SES on women's mental health \nIncreasing evidence tend to show a positive correlation between lower SES and negative mental health outcomes for women. Secondly, women are often the primary care-taker for their families. As a result, women with insecure job and housing experience higher stress and anxiety since their precarious economic situation places them and their children at higher risk of poverty and violent victimization (World Health Organization, 2013). Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. As compared to white transgender individuals, transgender individuals who are African American/black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, or Multiracial are at a greater risk of suicide attempts. Lesbian and bisexual youth have a higher percentage of substance use problems as compared to sexual minority males and heterosexual females. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Transgender individuals are significantly more likely than any other LGBTQ+ demographic to report an eating disorder diagnosis or compensatory behaviour related to eating. Transgender individuals may use weight restriction to suppress secondary sex characteristics or to suppress or stress gendered features. Conflicting studies have struggled to ascertain whether LGBTQ+ people of colour experience similar or varying rates of eating disorder proneness or diagnosis. Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. Sexual violence increasingly impact adolescent girls who are subjected to forced sex, rape and sexual assault. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse are likely to impact a women's mental health on a short and long-term basis. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. Gender bias in medicine \nThe World Health Organization notes gender differentials in both the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Gender bias observed in diagnostic and healthcare systems (including as related to under-diagnosis, over-diagnosis, and misdiagnosis) is detrimental to the treatment and health of people of all genders. The difference in diagnosis emerges at an early age, with diagnostic rates for children diverging on the basis of gender once children reach school age. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Diagnostic processes may be influenced by knowledge of a patient's sex or gender alone, and male and female patients may receive different diagnoses even when presenting the same symptoms. Misogynistic Bias in Medicine \nMisogynistic bias has impacted diagnosis and treatment of men and women alike throughout the history of psychiatry, and those disparities persist today. The diagnosis was used as a form of social labeling to discourage women from venturing outside of their role, that is a tool to take control over the increasing emancipation of women. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Socioeconomic status (SES) \nSocioeconomic Status is a global term which refers to a person's income level, education and position in society. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Gender disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) \nSES is a key factor in determining one's opportunities and quality of life. Inequities in wealth and quality of life for women are known to exist both locally and globally. According to a 2015 survey of the U.S Census Bureau, in the United States, women's poverty rates are higher than men's. Indeed, for a same level of education and an equivalent field of occupation, men earn a higher wage than women. Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". The impact of gender disparities in SES on women's mental health \nIncreasing evidence tend to show a positive correlation between lower SES and negative mental health outcomes for women. Secondly, women are often the primary care-taker for their families. As a result, women with insecure job and housing experience higher stress and anxiety since their precarious economic situation places them and their children at higher risk of poverty and violent victimization (World Health Organization, 2013). Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

While meeting these gender inclusive needs are critical, men and women also have different needs which must be addressed. Specifically, there are biological differences between men and women, which create different needs. For instance, the needs of women in a post-disaster context can include; having access to menstrual products, having access to a secure toilet (as going to a non secure toilet can leave women more vulnerable to the potential for rape or sexual assault) and having critical pre or post natal services, to name a few. Beyond women's immediate needs, women can face long-term income disparities as a result of disasters. Gender is correlated with the prevalence of certain mental disorders, including depression, anxiety and somatic complaints. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. People who identify as nonbinary or gender queer show increased risk for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. People who identify as transgender demonstrate increased risk for depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Some gender-specific risk factors that disproportionately affect women are income inequality, low social ranking, unrelenting child care, gender-based violence, and socioeconomic disadvantages. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Factors that contribute to the gender disproportionality of eating disorders are perceptions surrounding \"thinness\" in relation to success and sexual attractiveness and social pressures from mass media that are largely targeted towards women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Gender differences in mental health within the LGBTQ+ community\n\nRisk factors and the minority stress model \nThe minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. Some factors identified: the history of psychiatry with conflating sexual and gender identities with psychiatric symptomatology; medical community's history of labelling gender identities such as homosexuality as an illness (now removed from the DSM); the presence of gender dysphoria in the DSM-V; prejudice and rejection from physicians and healthcare providers; LGBTQ+ underrepresentation in research populations; physicians' reluctance to ask patients about their gender; and the presence of laws against the LGBTQ+ community in many countries. General patterns such as the prevalence of minority stress have been broadly studied. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. Compared to LGBTQ+ youth with highly accepting families, LGBTQ+ youth with less accepting families are more than three times likely to consider and attempt suicide. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Transgender individuals are at the greatest risk of suicide attempts. One-third of transgender individuals (both in youth and adulthood) has seriously considered suicide and one-fifth of transgender youth has attempted suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. As compared to white transgender individuals, transgender individuals who are African American/black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, or Multiracial are at a greater risk of suicide attempts.

However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours.

Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. Sexual violence increasingly impact adolescent girls who are subjected to forced sex, rape and sexual assault. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse are likely to impact a women's mental health on a short and long-term basis. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. Gender bias in medicine \nThe World Health Organization notes gender differentials in both the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Gender bias observed in diagnostic and healthcare systems (including as related to under-diagnosis, over-diagnosis, and misdiagnosis) is detrimental to the treatment and health of people of all genders. The difference in diagnosis emerges at an early age, with diagnostic rates for children diverging on the basis of gender once children reach school age. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Diagnostic processes may be influenced by knowledge of a patient's sex or gender alone, and male and female patients may receive different diagnoses even when presenting the same symptoms. Misogynistic Bias in Medicine \nMisogynistic bias has impacted diagnosis and treatment of men and women alike throughout the history of psychiatry, and those disparities persist today. The diagnosis was used as a form of social labeling to discourage women from venturing outside of their role, that is a tool to take control over the increasing emancipation of women. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Socioeconomic status (SES) \nSocioeconomic Status is a global term which refers to a person's income level, education and position in society. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Gender disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) \nSES is a key factor in determining one's opportunities and quality of life. Inequities in wealth and quality of life for women are known to exist both locally and globally. According to a 2015 survey of the U.S Census Bureau, in the United States, women's poverty rates are higher than men's. Indeed, for a same level of education and an equivalent field of occupation, men earn a higher wage than women. Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". The impact of gender disparities in SES on women's mental health \nIncreasing evidence tend to show a positive correlation between lower SES and negative mental health outcomes for women. Secondly, women are often the primary care-taker for their families. As a result, women with insecure job and housing experience higher stress and anxiety since their precarious economic situation places them and their children at higher risk of poverty and violent victimization (World Health Organization, 2013). Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.\nB. The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\nC. Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.\nD. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
