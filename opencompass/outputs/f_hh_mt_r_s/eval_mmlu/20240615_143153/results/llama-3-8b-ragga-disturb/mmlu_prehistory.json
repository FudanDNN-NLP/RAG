The Minoans were also innovators, developing (or adopting) a system of lead weights to facilitate economic transactions. pigs and artists were an important part of the Minoan economy as they produced many goods that were valued in trade as well as within Crete itself. Quite unlike the Minoans, whose society benefited from trade, the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the centre of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called Linear A) to write their early form of Greek in Linear B. The Mycenaean civilization perished \n\n The Mycenaean civilization emerged during the late Bronze Age, supplanting the Minoans as the dominant economic force in the area. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations – the Minoans of Crete and the Myceneans of the Peloponnese. The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean islands, flourishing from around 3000 to 1450 BC before a period of decline, finally ending at around 1100 BC. The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. The most notable Minoan palace \n\n other people.

After Khufu's death, his sons Djedefre (2566–2558 BC) and Khafre (2558–2532 BC) may have quarrelled. Alternatively, the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafre and Khufu himself. The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were king Menkaure (2532–2504 BC), who built the smallest pyramid in Giza, Shepseskaf (2504–2498 BC) and, perhaps, Djedefptah (2498–2496 BC). Djoser's pyramid was first built as a square mastaba like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today.

This is a list of Hopewell sites. The Hopewell tradition (also incorrectly called the \"Hopewell culture\") refers to the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern United States from 200 BCE to 500 CE. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations that were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period, but none in the interior of the state, indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana-Hopewell influence. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites. Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network, and the Havana-Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the Kansas City area of the Missouri River. Cultures of indigenous peoples lived along the river valleys for thousands of years before European contact. From more than two thousand years ago, 100 AD to 500 AD, people of the Hopewell culture transformed the area of Newark and Heath. Between 100 BC and AD 500, the Hopewell culture built the multi-earthwork complex on the terrace east of the Muskingum River near its mouth with the Ohio. Developed over many years, it had a large enclosed square, within which were four platform mounds, used for ceremonial purposes and elite residential; another square, and a larger conical mound used for burials.

To manage the job, Antrobus appointed Gowland, who, despite having no formal archaeological training, produced some of the finest, most detailed excavation records ever made at the monument. The only area that he opened was around the precariously leaning Stone 56 (the western stone of the Great Trilithon), an area measuring approximately 17 by. One of note is a roughly spherical monolith about 2.5 metres in diameter known as the Balancing Rock. The Heel Stone is a single large block of sarsen stone standing within the Avenue outside the entrance of the Stonehenge earthwork in Wiltshire, England.

Remarkably, some charcoalified fossils preserve tissue organised into the Kranz anatomy, with intact bundle sheath cells, allowing the presence C4 metabolism to be identified without doubt at this time. C3 plants preferentially use the lighter of two isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere, 12C, which is more readily involved in the chemical pathways involved in its fixation. Studies conducted on large herbivorous mammals have revealed that their dietary habits tracked the ecological shift from C3 forest and woodland to C4 savannah during the late Miocene. By comparing carbon isotope ratios with dental morphology of murine rodents, researchers have been able to evaluate the impact of ecological change on these small mammals. These findings indicate that the larger murine species consumed more C4 plants and exhibit dental morphology associated with grazing. Moreover, two clades of murine rodents exhibited different rates of morphological change, with the timing and trend of these changes closely related to the consumption of C4 diet during the vegetation shift. In summary, stable carbon isotope analysis in tooth enamel provides insights into the dietary composition of fossil mammals by determining whether they primarily consumed C3 or C4 plants. This analysis has been particularly informative for large herbivorous mammals, and recent research has begun to shed light on the dietary behaviors and responses of small mammals to ecological changes. The C4 metabolic pathway is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants, involving a complex set of adaptive changes to physiology and gene expression patterns. This suggests that it did not have a key role in invoking C4 evolution. Grasses themselves (the group which would give rise to the most occurrences of C4) had probably been around for 60 million years or more, so had had plenty of time to evolve C4, which, in any case, is present in a diverse range of groups and thus evolved independently. There is a strong signal of climate change \n\n These two pathways, with the same effect on RuBisCO, evolved a number of times independently – indeed, C4 alone arose 62 times in 18 different plant families. A number of 'pre-adaptations' seem to have paved the way for C4, leading to its clustering in certain clades: it has most frequently developed in plants that already had features such as extensive vascular bundle sheath tissue.

The researchers found residue on a grinding tool recovered from Grotta Paglicci, which indicated that these early humans collected and processed various plants. The presence of starch grains attributable to Avena (oat) caryopses suggests that these plants were used for producing flour. This expands our understanding of the food plants used during the Paleolithic in Europe and the origins of a food tradition that continues in the Mediterranean basin today. They were able to process food plants and possessed knowledge that would later become widespread after the advent of agriculture. This highlights how the exploitation of plant resources played a significant role in the lives of hunter-gatherer populations. While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the Czech Republic, a system of human-engineered aquaculture ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient Mesopotamia, with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in China. For instance, a 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, \"Shanidar IV\", in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from eight plant species, seven of which are used now as herbal remedies. Also, a mushroom was found in the personal effects of Ötzi the Iceman, whose body was frozen in the Ötztal Alps for more than 5,000 years. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed.

As late as 2006, no evidence for interbreeding was found. Neanderthal-inherited genetic material is \n\n non-African modern humans was more closely related to Neanderthals than other Africans were because of ancient genetic divisions within early Hominoids. Research since 2010 refined the picture of interbreeding between Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans. Interbreeding appears asymmetrically among the ancestors of modern-day humans, and this may explain differing frequencies of Neanderthal-specific DNA in the genomes of modern humans. They suggest \"two additional demographic models, involving either a second pulse \n\n Neanderthals inhabited much of Europe and western Asia from as far back as 130,000 years ago. They were eventually replaced by anatomically modern humans (AMH; sometimes known as Cro-Magnons), who began to appear in Europe circa 40,000 years ago. The question was resolved only in 2010, when it was established that Eurasian populations exhibit Neanderthal admixture, estimated at 1.5–2.1% on average. The Neanderthal genome project, established in 2006, presented the first fully sequenced Neanderthal genome in 2013. The divergence time between the Neanderthal and modern human lineages is estimated at between 750,000 and 400,000 years ago. (2014) A significantly deeper time of parallelism, combined with repeated early admixture events, was calculated by Rogers et al. (2016) presented evidence for AMH admixture to Neanderthals at roughly 100,000 years ago. The second occurred after the ancestral Melanesians branched; these people seem to bred with Denisovans. 2016 research indicates some Neanderthal males might not have viable male offspring with some AMH females.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about prehistory.

By 16,000 years ago the glacial melt allowed people to move \n\n The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), also referred to as the Late Glacial Maximum, was the most recent time during the Last Glacial Period that ice sheets were at their greatest extent. Ice sheets covered much of North America, Northern Europe, and Asia and profoundly affected Earth's climate by causing drought, desertification, and a large drop in sea levels. Decline of the West Antarctica ice sheet occurred between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, consistent with evidence for another abrupt rise in the sea level about 14,500 years ago. During the Ice Age a vast, cold and dry mammoth steppe stretched from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. Therefore, the flora and fauna of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North \n\n  The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the \"Ice Age\", spanned 125,000 –14,500YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age, which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000YBP and in Antarctica approximately 14,500YBP, which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14,500YBP and the Bering land bridge was finally inundated around 11,000YBP. Archaeologists contend that Paleo-Indian migration out of Beringia (eastern Alaska), ranges from 40,000 to around 16,500 years ago. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,000–13,000 years before present.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about prehistory.

The most notable of these techniques is photogrammetric mapping, which uses photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create accurate three-dimensional models of the archaeological evidence, including artefacts, historic buildings or whole landscapes. During excavations by OAS at Westgate Oxford, the site of a medieval Greyfriars friary, three-dimensional models were generated through a combination of standard archaeological survey techniques and photogrammetric or structure from motion techniques. It has been increasingly used by archaeologists to overcome the limitations of field-based reconnaissance and other remote sensing techniques in forested settings. Lidar has been successful in identifying permanent structures built by large-scale complex agriculturalist societies. The archaeological study of modern ruins is most commonly associated with contemporary, urban, and industrial archaeology. The processes and goals involved in the archaeological study of modern ruins are very similar to that of other branches of archaeology that primarily focus on studying sites of earlier time periods. Particular field methods used include meticulous surveying, excavation, and record keeping, all of which are generally similar to archaeology concerning older, buried sites. However, it has been argued that the archaeological approach to modern ruins should be more embodied and visually well rounded, rather than simply communicating information by conventional site descriptions and reports. Photography, for example, is often used as a medium to communicate discoveries made in modern ruins \n\n The Wheeler–Kenyon method is a method of archaeological excavation. The technique originates from the work of Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler at Verulamium (1930–35), and was later refined by Kathleen Kenyon during her excavations at Jericho (1952–58). It was believed that this approach allowed more precise stratigraphic observations than earlier \"horizontal exposure\" techniques that relied on architectural and ceramic analysis. Typometry in archaeology is the measurement and analysis of artifacts by various methods with metric measurements including length, width, surface area, cutting planes, hafting axis and others. The use of computers and mathematics in archaeology, and in particular of automated statistical analysis, have participated in the development of this field.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about prehistory.

By the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, most of Polynesia was a loose web of thriving cultures who settled on the islands' coasts and lived off the sea. Studies in Oceanic Culture History, Volume I. Pacific Anthropological Records 11. Journal of the Polynesian Society 81:79–86 ; Green, Roger C., 1973. Lapita pottery and the origins of Polynesian culture. Australian Natural History 17:332-37. ; Green, Roger C., 1977. Pottery art from Fijian towns shows that Fiji was settled by Austronesian peoples by at least 3500 to 1000 BC, with Melanesians following around a thousand years later, although there are still many open questions about the specific dates and patterns of human migration into Fiji and many other Pacific islands. It is believed that either the Lapita people or the ancestors of the Polynesians settled the islands first, but not much is known of what became of them after the Melanesians arrived; the old culture may have had some influence on the new one, and archaeological evidence shows that some of the migrants \n\n Pulotu was known for, the head of the Lapita people or proto-Fijian snd Pacific people. It is there that some believed that Tongan culture and its people developed and evolved out of the ancient Austronesian/Lapita culture (c. 1600 BCE - c. 500 BCE) that migrated from the South East Asian islands through Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Micronesia and Fiji about 8000 BC. Polynesian origins Green helped to develop a phylogenetic model of the Pacific using a combination of linguistic, ethnological, biological, and archaeological analysis; this work was complemented by ethnohistorical research of the ancestral Polynesian homeland, Hawaiki. ; Evolution of Polynesian languages From the 1960s, Green worked to classify Polynesian languages and identify common terms. ; The Lapita cultural complex Green was among the first to identify Lapita pottery and material culture with the Austronesian-speaking ancestors of the Polynesians. His excavations in the Reef and Santa Cruz Islands, as well as Watom Island in Papua New Guinea furnished significant data for this interpretation. ; Settlement patterns in Oceania Green pioneered the settlement pattern approach in the Pacific, which examined the archaeological landscape holistically\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about prehistory.

The study you mentioned emphasizes the significance of foraging flexibility in coastal/pelagic marine central place foragers, like the short-tailed shearwaters, who reside in highly variable environments. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. They spent time on the ground, and were semi-terrestrial, spending time in trees to feed \n\n Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis can lead a naïve nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. Controlled experiments with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care. The variation in subsistence technology among forager communities across different regions and time periods can be influenced by several factors. However, this hypothesis may not fully explain the subsistence technologies of desert foragers who typically live with simple technologies in high-risk environments. In such environments, the value of typical forager targets is high, and their locations are relatively predictable in space and time. This predictability allows foragers to invest resources and effort into developing and utilizing more complex tools. Additionally, environmental variation over deep time is believed to contribute to changes in toolkit among forager communities. As environments change, foragers may need to adapt their subsistence technologies to suit new conditions and resource availability. It's important to note that these factors may interact with each other and that the actual variation in subsistence technology across forager communities is likely influenced by a combination of multiple factors specific to each region and time period.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about prehistory.

André Cheynier and Henri Breuil conclusively determined four settlement periods in 1963 by analyzing the stratification of the sediments and the precise location of the many stone artifacts and animal bones.

He is also curious about the emergence of cave art towards the very end of the Middle Paleolithic, where drawings and traces of red ochre finally emerge 50,000 years ago; this art, the first remnants of true human creativity, would usher in the Upper Paleolithic and the birth of complex religion.

Developing around the same time, the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics also began as a pictographic script and evolved into a system of syllabic writing. Two cursive scripts were eventually created, hieratic, shortly after hieroglyphs were invented, and demotic (Egyptian) in the seventh century BC. The first known alphabetical system came from the Phoenicians, who \n\n The transition from proto-writing to the earliest fully developed writing systems took place in the late 4th to early 3rd millennia BC in the Fertile Crescent. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what \n\n  The original Sumerian writing system derives from a system of clay tokens used to represent commodities. By the 29th century BC, writing, at first only for logograms, using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term cuneiform) developed to include phonetic elements, gradually replacing round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing by around 2700–2500 BC. Finally, cuneiform writing became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. From the 26th century BC, this script was adapted to the Akkadian language, and from there to others, such as Hurrian and Hittite. One of the earliest known forms of written expression is cuneiform. Actual writing is first recorded in Uruk, at the end of the 4th millennium BC, and soon after in various parts of the Near-East.

Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables:  Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries. In modern Western societies, social stratification is typically defined in terms of three social classes: the upper class, the middle class, and the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship, clan, tribe, or caste, or all four. It derives from the Latin strātum (plural '; parallel, horizontal layers) referring to a given society's categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth, income, social status, occupation and power.

We also know from archaeological evidence that Minoan artisans practised a large range of craftsmanship jobs including: scribes, potters, metalworkers, leather workers, glass and faience artists, painters, sculptors, engravers and jewelers. There was an area set aside for artisans and their workshops in every palace, and in town like Malia, they had both workshops in town and in the palace. The production of oil was an important activity in which Minoan artisans were engaged. One thing is certain: after the eruption, Minoan imports stopped coming into Aghia Irini (VIII), to be replaced by Mycenaean imports. Evidence of this is shown in Egyptian tomb paintings where the Keftyw (people believed to be the Minoans) bring said ingots to the Egyptian king in gift exchange (The Egyptians and Minoans had a history of cultural exchange). Another industry that contributed to the Minoan economy was the wine industry, which is mentioned in Linear A, but the small amounts referred to suggest it was a commodity reserved for the wealthier class.
