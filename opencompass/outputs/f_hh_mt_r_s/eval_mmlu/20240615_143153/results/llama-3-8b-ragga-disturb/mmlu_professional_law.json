You will get a doctor to swear that a man who has a slight knock on the head to say that he has a diseased spine, and will never be fit for anything again, and never be capable of being a man of business or the father of a family. An attorney who suffered brain damage after he was misdiagnosed at a hospital outside of Chicago was awarded a $20 million medical malpractice settlement. Two days later the attorney collapsed at his law office after suffering a subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually caused by a ruptured aneurysm. In the lawsuit, filed in 2013 by the man's wife, it was alleged that the emergency room physicians were medically negligent for failing to identify and treat bleeding in the man's brain. The doctors, according to the lawsuit, failed to order a CT scan and consult a neurologist the first time the man went to the hospital. Had he been diagnosed days earlier via a CT scan and lumbar puncture, doctors could have performed the same procedure to the smaller “warning bleed” and potentially prevented the massive hemorrhage that caused the stroke and subsequent brain damage, the family's attorney said. The trial judge accepted the settlement, but issued an order that dismissed the case's named physician defendants without prejudice, meaning in the future, a lawsuit could be filed against individual doctors. Dr. Kently discussed all benefits, risks and alternatives to care with the patient, and Mr. Orson consented to the treatment. Mr. Orson was now unable to move his left leg, and he was prepped for an emergency hematoma evacuation due to the high risk of paralysis. A decompressive laminectomy at C4, C5 and C6 with an extradural hematoma evacuation was performed just after noon on March 7. The suit alleged that Dr. Kently was negligent in his examination, diagnosis, care and adjustment of Mr. Orson’s cervical spine. As a result, Mr. Orson (now the plaintiff) was left with spinal cord damage, bleeding and paralysis. Several months went by until February 26, 2015, when the plaintiff’s attorney presented to the NCMIC-retained defense attorney a settlement demand package of $5.75 million for all damages, past and future, sustained by Mr. Orson and his wife. However, it was revealed that Mr. Orson was receiving a sizable disability benefit through his former employer, which included medical insurance and a monthly disability check. The investigator was able to capture surveillance video of the plaintiff walking with a normal gait, driving around town and carrying items without problem. Consequently, the plaintiff’s attorney reduced his demand to the doctor’s $1 million policy limits and subsequently never reduced it. The NCMIC defense team assembled a panel of experts including a Doctor of Chiropractic, a neurosurgeon and a neuroradiologist. Additionally, the defense neuroradiologist expert testified that it was his professional assessment that the hematoma was likely several days old and was already developing when the patient reported neck pain increase during his seventh chiropractic visit. Another important element for the defense was that the post-operative MRI showed complete recovery, which was not consistent with Mr. Orson’s complaints of residual problems. Because Dr. Kently had not revealed this information to his defense counsel, the plaintiff’s attorney was able to use it against the doctor. Dr. Kently did not note in his records nor did he advise his defense team that prior to litigation he had given Mr. Orson a copy of his records. The records provided to the plaintiff’s attorney during discovery were found to be slightly different, which concerned the defense team. Altered treatment records are often a major detriment to the defense of a malpractice case. When the case went to trial in April 2016, the plaintiff’s attorney attempted to portray cervical manipulations as inherently dangerous. He presented an animated video to the jury that depicted cervical adjustments as forceful and the cause of injury. Due to a state-specific statute, NCMIC was able to recover $75,000 of its litigation costs directly from the plaintiff as a result of the defense verdict. Adhering to the standard of care is often a critical element in a defense verdict. In this case, Dr. Kently’s examination, evaluation, assessment and clinical documentation were thorough and appropriate. Doctors should never keep important information from their defense team no matter how embarrassing or offensive the matter. Defense counsel is appointed by NCMIC to represent your best interests, not those of NCMIC. In this case, Dr. Kently committed a serious sin of omission by not telling his defense team about his past board allegation. Rarely is there one “smoking gun” in a malpractice case, but this case did provide several aha moments. Also harmful to the character and credibility of the plaintiff was the fact that he failed to disclose his disability income, which would diminish the value of his initial demand. In all probability, these credibility gaps were important to the jury finding for the defense. A case with excellent clinical care and questionable doctor credibility could have a very different outcome than one in which the clinical care is questionable and the doctor’s credibility is outstanding. In this case, the doctor demonstrated quality clinical care and was an excellent witness on his own behalf. The court rejected a traditional fixed method of determining which law should apply, and instead, a process of weighing factors such as relationship between the party, decision to take the trip, connections to the locality. Thus, the Court held that the parties did not have substantial connection with Ontario and so it would be unfair to apply the law as the location was largely fortuitous. The defense attorney for the Smiths said the injuries on the boy's body did not cause the boy's death and that the medical examiner did not perform tests that would have cleared his clients. During the trial, the defense attorney pointed out that there was no DNA evidence to prove the boy was locked inside the wooden box as the prosecution claimed. The defense also said the closet that prosecutors accused the parents of locking the boy in had no wall to prevent him from going into his bedroom, because his father had been renovating the house.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional law.

As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case.

Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, with malice aforethought. It involves a deliberate and premeditated act of killing someone. This means that although there may not have been an intention to kill, there was still negligence or disregard for human life which resulted in someone's death. The classification of a killing as manslaughter or murder depends on factors such as the presence of malice aforethought, provocation, and diminished capacity. It is important to note that murder is generally considered an extremely serious crime in most societies. Convictions for murder often result in harsh punishments such as long-term prison sentences, life imprisonment, or even capital punishment depending on the jurisdiction and legal system in place.

MCOCA makes an execution to this rule, allowing certain confessions made to police officers to be admissible in evidence.

However, there are many exceptions to the warrant requirement, including exigent circumstances, search incident to arrest, consent search, plain view, automobile exception, and border search exception. The Court has identified three exigent circumstances: emergency aid, hot pursuit, and destruction of evidence. The “hot pursuit” exception allows officers to pursue a fleeing suspect onto protected property without a warrant. Before Kentucky v. King was decided, lower courts had developed the \"police-created exigency\" doctrine, which stated that police may not create exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule, based on the language of the fourth amendment that the people are to be \"secure ... against unreasonable searches and seizures\".

Specifically, the Court held that “Though the police must, whenever practicable, secure a warrant to make a search and seizure, that procedure cannot be followed where swift action based upon on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat is required” and “The reasonableness of any particular search and seizure must be assessed in light \n\n Courts have also established an \"exigent circumstances\" exception to the warrant requirement.

The purchaser tested the boiler to its satisfaction and accepted it. After three months of use—during which time defendants had nothing whatever to do with the boiler, and had no care or management of it—the boiler exploded and damaged the adjacent property. The injured plaintiffs alleged that the boiler had been negligently manufactured, and sued on the theory that this breached a duty. The computer-controlled installation, that draws inspiration from the flock of birds, is composed of as many as 180 hand-blown glass tubes suspended from cables and outfitted with halogen lamps. A mirror hanging on the wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in the mirror image. “Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment, whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.” Plaintiff entered defendant's restaurant and ordered \"New York baked beans and corned beef.\" There was no evidence either that the defendant knew of the presence of the stones in the food, or that he made an express warranty as to the food. Plaintiff appeals her contract claim, arguing that the defendant breached an implied warranty under the Uniform Sales Act (St. 1908 c. 237 §15(1), predecessor of UCC Article 2), which says that:\n\n The plaintiff company engaged the defendants to design and install in their factory, an old mill, a pipe system to convey hot molten wax used in the production of Plasticine. The defendants unwisely chose to use plastic piping. Once installed, the defendants chose to initiate the new system at night, but without any supervision. The plastic pipes melted and the molten wax escaped and caught fire, causing a huge conflagration. The defendant sought to rely on a clause in the contract that purported to limit their liability for breach of contract.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional law.

This case sparked a national controversy on the definition and ethics of euthanasia as well as the rights of people with disabilities,  and led to two Supreme Court decisions, R. v. Latimer (1997), on section 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and later R. v. Latimer (2001), on cruel and unusual punishments under section 12 of the Charter. The Supreme Court judgment of 1997 noted, \"It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain.\" Her mother was holding her right leg in a fixed, flexed position with her knee in the air and any time you tried to move that leg Tracy expressed pain and cried out\".She also noted that despite having a hip that had been dislocated for many months Tracy could not take painkillers because she was on anti-seizure medication which, in combination with painkillers, could lead to renewed seizures, stomach bleeding,  constipation, aspiration and aspiration pneumonia. Considering it too intrusive, the Latimers did not wish a feeding tube to be inserted, though according to the 2001 Supreme Court judgment, it might have allowed more effective pain medication to be administered and it might have improved her nutrition and health. According to the Crown prosecutors' brief presented at the second trial, \"She also responded to visits by her family, smiling and looking happy to see them. As well, the quality of her life was limited by her severe disability. When confronted by police with autopsy evidence that high levels of carbon monoxide were found in Tracy's blood, Latimer confessed that he had killed her by placing her in his truck and connecting a hose from the truck's exhaust pipe to the cab. Murder trials and appeals\nLatimer was charged with first-degree murder, convicted of second-degree murder by a jury, and sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 10 years. In February 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear a further appeal; and in June 1996, the original Crown prosecutor was charged with attempting to obstruct justice through jury tampering. In February 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a new trial for Latimer because of the allegations of jury tampering; it began on 22 October 1997. The second trial judge had found that a 10-year sentence granted Latimer a constitutional exemption from the mandatory minimum sentence, sentencing Latimer to one year in prison followed by a year of probation, but the original conviction was upheld by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2001, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Latimer's crime could not be justified through the defence of necessity, and found that, despite the special circumstances of the case, the lengthy prison sentence given to Latimer was not cruel and unusual, and therefore not a breach of section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court also ruled that Latimer was not denied rights to jury nullification, as no such rights exist, and his prison sentence was thus upheld. He told the parole board that he believed killing his daughter was the right thing to do. In January 2008, lawyer Jason Gratl filed the appeal on Latimer's behalf, arguing that in denying parole, the board had violated its own rules by requiring admission of wrongdoing and by ignoring the low risk for reoffending. In February 2008, a review board overturned the earlier parole board decision, and granted Latimer day parole stating that there was low risk that Latimer would re-offend. On his release he stated that he planned to press for a new trial and for identification of the pain medication that the 2001 Supreme Court ruling suggested he could have used instead of killing his daughter. Justice Mactavish ordered the board to reassess Latimer's application. The National Parole Board was also directed by the Judge to apply the least restrictive conditions consistent with society's protection. Latimer was assessed to have a low risk of re-offending. Public debate\n\nSupport for Latimer\nA 1999 poll found that 73% of Canadians believed that Latimer acted out of compassion and should receive a more lenient sentence. The same poll found that 41% believe that mercy killing should be legal. Ethicist Arthur Schafer argued that Latimer was \"the only person in Canadian history to spend even a single day in prison for a mercy killing\" and that compassion and common sense dictated a reduced sentence and the granting of parole. Support for Latimer's conviction and sentence\nNumerous disability rights groups obtained intervenor status in the Latimer's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that killing a disabled child like Tracy is no different from killing a non-disabled child and should carry the same penalty. To do otherwise, they argued, would devalue the lives of disabled people and increase the risk of more such killings by their caregivers. Latimer's 2007 application for day-parole was rejected primarily because he still denied any wrongdoing. Maclean's columnist Andrew Coyne argued that the National Parole Board was right to expect remorse on Latimer's part, because to do otherwise might inspire others to similar actions.

Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill.

Four months later, the defendant decided to sell the land to a bona-fide purchaser for value without notice, collecting at least (and presumably more than) as much money from the bona fide purchaser than the original contract price with the plaintiff. The contract with the bona-fide purchaser was performed, and the purchaser was registered as the proprietor of the land under the Torrens system. The plaintiff sought a declaration from the court that the defendant held the proceeds of sale with the third party, on trust for the plaintiff; and equitable relief in the form of an order that the plaintiff be paid the proceeds of that sale. Contracts for the purchase of real property virtually always provide for the contract to be receipted at the title company, and for the buyer to then perform inspections and review the title commitment before proceeding with the transaction.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?\nA. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\nB. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.\nD.

United States of America was a complaint for declaratory judgment action filed in the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington. At issue was the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act. with Microsoft arguing that secrecy orders were preventing them from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Although no laws were changed, the new DOJ policy \"changed data request rules on alerting Internet users about agencies accessing their information,\" and mandated defined periods of time for secrecy orders from the government. The lawsuit concerned the portion of federal law that deals with delayed notice, 18 USC 2705(b) of the Stored Communications Act. At issue was the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Although normally a person must be told by police that their homes are searched, via a warrant, the 1986 law allows police to get a special exemption to check computers without a warrant. Microsoft argued that \"People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud.

In affirming, the appeals court first explained that the Good Samaritan Law affording immunity against civil damages to doctors who come to the assistance of other doctors in emergency situations has been included in the Business and Professions Code for almost 50 years. Case law has developed a fourth element: (4) physicians who treat patients requiring immediate medical care as part of their normal course of practice do not need the added inducement that immunity from civil liability would provide. The family contended on appeal that the trial court erroneously interposed and sustained its own lack of foundation objection to an exhibit included in their opposition, namely a copy of the Call Coverage contract between the hospital and the defendant doctors’ medical group. The record showed that the plaintiffs filed the Call Coverage contract into evidence as an exhibit attached to a declaration from their lawyer. Specifically, it created obligations for the two doctors to provide emergency vascular services to patients at the hospital on an on-call basis, and the doctors were on-call doctors at the time they cared for and treated the patient. The defendants, the appeals court held, filed a properly formatted series of separate evidentiary objections to the attorney’s declaration. Among a number of other objections, the defendant doctors interposed two objections, based on Evidence Code section 403, for a lack of foundation. It further held that given the record, the plaintiffs’ contention that the court interposed an objection sua sponte was incorrect. The plaintiffs argued there were triable issues of fact regarding whether the doctors had a pre-existing duty to render care to the patient, given the evidence of the Call Coverage contract. The case hinged on whether there were any disputed facts concerning the fourth element required for immunity under section 2396, namely the absence of a preexisting duty of professional care on the part of the doctors to the patient. Microsoft alleged that it has the right to inform customers when the United States government obtains a warrant to read their emails or access their information in the cloud. The company alleged that it is unconstitutional \"to force the company to remain silent and not inform customers when their cloud data has been searched or inspected by authorities.\" Microsoft contended in the case that while some cases might require secrecy, the practice of indefinite gag orders had become far too common. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional law.

One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\nA.

Diminished capacity refers to cases where the defendant's mental state was impaired at the time of the killing, reducing their ability to form malicious intent. This means that although there may not have been an intention to kill, there was still negligence or disregard for human life which resulted in someone's death. All US states have implied consent laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to an evidential breathalyzer or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration; however, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidence from a chemical test, probable cause for arrest must be demonstrated. In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Birchfield v. North Dakota, held that both breath tests and \n\n In such cases, there is clear subjective evidence that the accused foresaw but did not desire the particular outcome. When the accused failed to stop the given behavior, he took the risk of causing the given loss or damage. By deciding to proceed, the accused actually intends the other to be exposed to the risk of that injury. In common law, for example, an unlawful homicide committed recklessly would ordinarily constitute the crime of voluntary manslaughter. One committed with \"extreme\" or \"gross\" recklessness as to human life would constitute murder, sometimes defined as \"depraved heart\" or \"abandoned and malignant heart\" or \"depraved indifference\" murder. Unlicensed prize fights and other criminal activities of a sporting nature where the players consent and the audience actively approves of what they see (in English law, see R v Coney).

These situations are distinguishable from soliciting the cessation of life-sustaining treatment so that the injured person may die a natural death, \n\n ; In June 2012 18-year-old Aaron Deveau of Haverhill, Massachusetts, was found guilty of motor vehicle homicide by texting.

Using the precedent set by the Gerstein case – in which the Supreme Court ruled that Florida's practice of keeping suspects for 30 days without probable cause was unconstitutional – and close interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, they found that the County of Riverside's practice of keeping suspects in lengthy custody without probable cause determination amounted to illegal \n\n to show that he was going to be subject to unconstitutional actions by the County, such as detention without probable cause. During this time, a second amended complaint was accepted (as individuals and class representatives), which added three more plaintiffs – Johnny E. James, Diana Ray Simon, and Michael Scott Hyde – who alleged that law enforcement officials arrested them without a warrant and were held without probable cause. In 1989, the plaintiffs requested the District Court judge issue an injunction ordering the County of Riverside to give probable cause hearings to those who were detained more quickly. Withholding probable cause determinations from suspects for longer than 48 hours after arrest, absent exigent circumstances, would violate the Fourth Amendment. If the Board denied parole at this final hearing, the prisoner was furnished with a written explanation within 30 days. The attorney for Ortiz also argued that a warrant should have been required for the search to take place, leaving the decision for probable cause up to a judicial officer, and not to a Border Patrol man. In his oral arguments, Sevilla stated \"There was a warrant requirement because this is the concept where certainly a judicial officer should make the determination and not a Border Patrol man standing 66 miles north of a border determining a legal concept such as the functional equivalent of probable cause\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional law.

The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC.

The respondents (M) owned a property situated between the foot of a steep escarpment and the foreshore. The property once formed part of the lands owned by J and he was the owner of the land between the property and the public road.

To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land.

Buyer agrees to and is bound to these Conditions set forth in this Agreement by submitting a New Account Application, Purchase Order, or Invoice Payment to WellGistics. In the event of a conflict between these Conditions and the terms of another written agreement signed by WellGistics and Buyer, the conflicting terms of the later dated document control. In addition to the statements made in the definitions below, these Conditions apply to any offer, acceptance, acknowledgment, invoice, proposal, quotation, or other similar document issued by WellGistics in connection with a sale of Products to Buyer. These Conditions also apply to any Purchase Order or other similar document issued by Buyer in connection with the purchase of Products from WellGistics, unless the parties expressly agree to the contrary in a writing signed by the Parties. WellGistics is not obligated to accept any Purchase Order from Buyer and all orders are subject to acceptance by WellGistics. Once WellGistics agrees to fill an order for Products, Buyer’s order cannot be cancelled without WellGistics' written consent. Unless different terms are agreed to in writing by WellGistics, all Buyer’s Purchase Orders issued to WellGistics shall be prepaid via ACH bank transfer, wire transfer, cashier's check, or debit or credit card payment (with an additional convenience fee). If Buyer pays via ACH bank transfer, or debit or credit card payment, Buyer agrees to allow WellGistics to process future Purchase Orders via the same method and account. Buyer agrees to allow WellGistics to store Buyer's financial account information to automatically process such orders. If Buyer fails to maintain a sufficient balance or credit line in the account that WellGistics has on file and charges, Buyer will be solely responsible for any and all associated penalties, fees, or surcharges imposed by Buyer's financial institution. If Buyer's Purchase Order is not prepaid, Buyer agrees to pay WellGistics for the Purchase Order no later than ten (10) calendar days from the earlier of the shipping date or invoice date. Buyer further agrees to pay WellGistics a late charge on any past due amounts at the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less. In the event that Buyer is past due in payment of any amounts owed, whether invoiced or not, WellGistics may place Buyer's account into credit hold status. While in credit hold status, any pending shipments, or additional Purchase Orders placed may be suspended at WellGistics' sole discretion. Receipt by WellGistics of payment in full for all outstanding balances, including any late fees or associated penalties, is required for WellGistics to consider removing an account from credit hold status. Buyer shall furnish financial information requested by WellGistics as reasonably required in order to establish Buyer’s eligibility for the extension of credit. Buyer will pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by WellGistics in collecting any amounts owed by Buyer. It is not WellGistics' general practice to offer credit terms to Buyers. However, credit terms may be extended on accounts whose credit standing has been approved by WellGistics. If approved, credit may be extended up to a level adequate to meet the Buyer’s expected purchase patterns under stated terms of sale provided that the Buyer, in WellGistics' discretion, can demonstrate ability to pay. Buyer must furnish information requested by WellGistics for review to verify its ability to pay sums due, including but not limited to Buyer’s audited financial statements. WellGistics reserves the right to require payment in advance of shipment or delivery in cash, or to suspend or cancel any further shipments until payment has been received, if in WellGistics' sole judgment Buyer’s financial condition or creditworthiness has become impaired. Failure to furnish payment within ten (10) calendar days of demand by WellGistics shall constitute a repudiation of the Agreement and any credit agreement, and in such event WellGistics shall be entitled to receive reimbursement for its costs related to cancellation. If credit is extended to Buyer, the maximum term for the payment of Product purchased by Buyer from WellGistics on credit shall be forty-five (45) calendar days. WellGistics may charge a service fee on Purchase Orders that are fulfilled on credit, in accordance with the following schedule: (i) up to two percent (2%) of purchase price on a fifteen (15) day credit term; (ii) up to three and a half percent (3.5%) of purchase price on a thirty (30) day credit term; and (iii) up to two five (5%) of purchase price on a forty-five (45) day credit term. If Buyer fails to pay WellGistics by the expiration of the agreed upon credit term, the default interest rate of one and a half percent shall apply to the past due balance as stated above in the Payment Terms in addition to the service fee. If Buyer fails to timely pay in accordance with these Conditions, Buyer shall be responsible to reimburse WellGistics for all costs of collection. If WellGistics retains or employs attorneys or other agencies in order to secure payment of any sums due from Buyer, or otherwise enforce these Conditions or any credit agreement, Buyer agrees to pay attorney and/or collection fees, costs, and any and all other related expenses in addition to all sums due. Any increase to shipping cost based on the request of the Buyer for specialized services, or request of non-primary WellGistics carrier/vendor or upgrade from ground to expedited shall be invoiced separately and be paid for by the Buyer. Buyer may provide WellGistics with Buyer’s shipping account number to use Buyer’s shipping vendor. Subject to the terms of any applicable Consignment Agreement between the Parties, Buyer will at all times handle, maintain, store, transport, deliver and otherwise manage and distribute the Products supplied by WellGistics in strict accordance with all handling, maintenance, storage, transportation, delivery and distribution requirements as labeled on the Products or as specified by WellGistics or the third-party manufacturer and in strict accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and practices. Buyer shall keep and maintain for the period of time required by applicable laws (but at least for a five-year period) detailed records and make such records available for inspection by WellGistics during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice. Buyer shall pay when due all taxes and governmental charges of any kind including without limitation all sales, use, personal property, ad valorem, value added, stamp or other taxes, levies, customs duties or other similar charges or fees (other than any taxes based on WellGistics' net income), imposed by any government or government agency on the Products (or the use thereof) as a direct or indirect result of the transactions hereunder (“Tax”). Buyer will indemnify and hold WellGistics harmless against any such taxes, duties or fees and shall reimburse WellGistics upon demand for any Tax owed by Buyer that is paid by WellGistics, whether such Tax is designated, levied or based on transactions hereunder. Subject to the terms of any Consignment Agreement or Credit Agreement between Buyer and WellGistics (if applicable), Buyer hereby grants and WellGistics hereby retains, a purchase money security interest and lien in and to the Products, wherever located, and all replacements or proceeds of the Products, until the invoice for the applicable Products is paid in full, including any late charges and costs of collection. Buyer consents to WellGistics' use of this Agreement, as well as Product invoices, as financing statements for protecting this security interest and hereby appoints WellGistics as Buyer’s agent for service of process. Buyer acknowledges that WellGistics is a wholesale distributor of the Products and is not a manufacturer of the Products. Buyer acknowledges that WellGistics is not liable for any illness or condition resulting from compromised or damaged Products or due to improper or inappropriate administration of the Products.

WellGistics shall not be liable to Buyer or to any third party for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages nor for any injury to persons or property, under any claim or theory of recovery. The entire liability of WellGistics to Buyer, and the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer, for any claim or cause of action arising hereunder (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) will not exceed the purchase price paid for the Products which are the subject of such claim or cause of action. WellGistics will not have any tort liability to Buyer arising from this Agreement including claims relating to negligence or defects in the Products. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless WellGistics and its employees, officers, directors, and agents from and against any and all losses, claims, suits, demands, damages, costs, expenses, attorneys’ fees, fines, and penalties that result from or arise out of (i) an actual or alleged defect in the Products; (ii) any misconduct, negligence, misrepresentation, error or omission on the part of Buyer or Buyer's employees, subcontractors or agents; and (iii) any breach by Buyer or default of Buyer of any of its representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement. WellGistics shall have the right hereunder to cancel all or part of any Purchase Order(s) to which these Conditions of Sale apply after its acceptance of the Purchase Order(s) without penalty or cancellation charge. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, WellGistics agrees that it will restrict the use of the Products to the United States, excluding its territories. Buyer represents and warrants that is has in place and will maintain all necessary licenses, permits, certificates, and other requisite documents in connection with purchasing, handling, maintaining, storing, transporting, delivering and otherwise managing and dispensing the Products purchased under this Agreement. In addition, Buyer shall obtain all permits and licenses required by federal, state or local authorities in connection with any of the goods and shall bear all expenses in obtaining such permits and licenses or in complying with any related rules, regulations, ordinances and statutes. Buyer represents and warrants that all locations designated as “ship-to” locations shall have all necessary licenses, permits, certificates and other authorizations required to receive shipment of Products from WellGistics legally. If and to the extent any discount, credit, rebate or other purchase incentive is paid or applied by WellGistics with respect to the goods purchased hereunder, such discount, credit, rebate or other purchase incentive shall constitute a \"discount or other reduction in price,\" as such terms are defined under the Medicare/Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute, on the goods purchased by Buyer hereunder. WellGistics and Buyer agree to use their best eﬀorts to comply with any and all requirements imposed on sellers and buyers, respectively, under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(3)(A) and the \"safe harbor\" regulations regarding discounts or other reductions in price set forth in 42 C.F.R. In this regard, Buyer may have an obligation to accurately report, under any state or federal program which provides cost or charge based reimbursement for the goods or services covered by these Conditions of Sale, the net cost actually paid by Buyer. Neither party shall have any right or power to act for or bind the other, in any respect, to pledge its credit, to accept any service of process upon it, or to receive any notices of any nature whatsoever. Buyer may not assign this Agreement, its duties, or its benefits to anyone else without WellGistics' prior written consent. These Conditions are subject to revision, amendment or supplement by WellGistics from time to time, and such revision, amendment or supplement shall be binding upon Buyer. This Agreement supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, communications and agreements, including but not limited to representations made in WellGistics sales literature and advice given to Buyer by WellGistics or any agent or employee thereof that may have been made in connection with Buyer's purchase of any Products from WellGistics. Waiver – WellGistics may waive (or forgive liability) of any breach (or failure) by Buyer to abide by any of these Conditions. Also, waivers apply only to specifically identified failures and do not give Buyer permission to breach Conditions at other times. If Buyer disputes an invoice in good faith, Buyer shall promptly notify WellGistics in writing of the grounds for the dispute and pay any undisputed portion of the invoice. All receiving discrepancies (including Product shortage, defect or damage) must be reported to WellGistics (via phone, e-mail, or fax) in accordance with the following: (i) Buyer must report any claims for shortage, defects or damage to any refrigerated Products upon receipt of shipment from WellGistics; and (ii) on all other Products within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of shipment. WellGistics may suspend deliveries of Product under this Agreement and shall be released from its obligations if, and to the extent that any delay or failure to perform such obligations, is due to fire or other casualty, product or material shortages, strikes or labor disputes, transportation delays, change in business conditions (other than insignificant changes), manufacturer out-of stock or delivery disruptions, acts of God, seasonal supply disruptions, government action, including the inability to obtain quota for controlled substance products, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of WellGistics. In addition, WellGistics may allocate available Product among its customers from emergency supply inventories and reduce or otherwise adjust Buyer’s orders accordingly without liability to Buyer by notifying Buyer of the same. If arbitration is necessary, it will be conducted by telephone and email, and if it must be done in person, it will be conducted in Lakeland, Florida. If Wellgistics makes a change to these Conditions that, in its sole discretion, is material, WellGistics will update this webpage and may send an email to the address associated with Buyer's account.

Since that was the only possible reason he had found for her termination, it could not be alleged that she would have been fired \n\nYet another appellate court has condemned drug-maker Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for its conduct in failing to study and failing to warn about the breast cancer risk associated with its hormone therapy drugs. After Phase I, the jury found that E+P was a cause of Ms. Barton’s breast cancer and awarded $3.7 million in compensatory damages. After a five-week trial, with PBM attorney Tobi Millrood serving as lead trial counsel for the plaintiff, the jury awarded Mrs. Kendall $6.3 million in compensatory damages and $28 million in punitive damages – $16 million assessed against Wyeth and $12 million against Upjohn. The trial judge in Barton cut the punitive damages award from $75 million to $5.6 million, and the trial judge in Kendall cut the award from $28 million to just $1 million. In both cases, all of the parties sought appeals to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Ms. Barton and Mrs. Kendall each appealed only one issue: whether the trial judge in each case was correct in reducing the punitive damages awards. The cases proceeding separately on appeal, with separate briefing, although the same Superior Court panel heard consolidated oral argument on the cases. Kendall v. Wyeth, Slip Op. We recognize that in a similar case argued before the same panel, Kendall v. Wyeth, et al., we reinstated a punitive award with a ratio of 4.44:1, or more than four times compensatory damages. It should also be noted that the plaintiff in that case suffered unusually devastating physical and emotional injuries, including a double mastectomy, serious complications from reconstructive surgery, and a 75% chance of recurrence. Indeed, had the trial court in this case elected, in its discretion, to remit damages in an amount greater than a 2:1 ratio, we would have no hesitancy in affirming that judgment; however, we discern no inherent inconsistency between the case sub judice and Kendall, where the jury’s initial award of $75 million in punitive damages here was plainly excessive. The Superior Court has relinquished jurisdiction, but the drug companies retain the right to seek reconsideration and seek further appellate review. She had been an effective trial attorney who had turned down promotions to remain in the courtroom. A judge had also persuaded her to take part in a probation program for juvenile first offenders he ran. In October of that year, Myers was told she would be transferred to the section run by that judge. She enjoyed the position she was in at the time, in another judge's section, and feared that if she were transferred she would have to recuse herself from cases where she had counseled defendants \n\n job performance by photocopying the questionnaires. \"Even had such evidence been offered,\" he added, \"this court could not conclude that such an act carries much weight in regard to striking a balance in the state's favor.\" Connick had also not shown any evidence that the distribution of the questionnaires on work time impeded her job performance. As an assistant district attorney, Gordon wrote, she was entitled to some latitude in her work hours. \"There is no evidence to indicate that plaintiff was anything other than a hardworking, conscientious attorney who fulfilled the \n\nNO NEED TO COMPLY WITH PRE-SUIT REGARDING CLAIM THAT DURING COURSE OF SURGERY PLAINTIFF WAS ADMINISTERED CONTAMINATED HEPARIN THAT HAD BEEN RECALLED BY THE SUPPLIER. Fifth District engaged in very helpful analysis, both discussing the threshold for certiorari, as well as when a plaintiff must comply with pre-suit notice requirements under the Medical Malpractice Act. First, the court reminded us that a petitioner must establish a departure from the essential requirements of law, along with a consequent material injury in the absence of an adequate remedy on appeal which together equate to “irreparable harm” required for certiorari. The court noted that the irreparable harm for the failure to comply with pre-suit comes when a court improperly denies a motion to dismiss for failure to follow such requirements, and the defendant loses the cost savings benefits that the Medical Malpractice Act was intended to create. The court gave examples of those instances when ordinary (not medical) negligence occurs (dropping of hot tea on the plaintiff, improper collection and labeling of a urine specimen for a drug test, and sexual assault), and also noted cases where courts have found the wrongful act was directly related to the improper application of medical services and the use of professional judgment or skill, which requires compliance with the pre-suit requirements under the Act. Additionally, because the hospital’s decision to administer the heparin was not the gravamen of the complaint (it was the recall), the wrongful act really arose out of an alleged failure of an administrative policy and therefore did not involve professional medical judgment or skill. In this posture, where the plaintiff essentially waived the UM claim, the Fourth District said she had no right to complain about the issue on appeal and affirmed on all issues presented. Schmieder v. NCL America, 39 Fla. Law Weekly D2559 (Fla. 3rd DCA December 10, 2014). Prior to filing her initial brief, she served the defendant with a motion pursuant to §57.105, advising that if the appellee did not file a confession of error within 21 days of service, the appellant would file the motion. The appellee did not confess error however, leading the appellant to file the motion for sanctions. The court explained that the statute and rule are crafted to allow a party to seek sanctions against another party who has “filed a paper or otherwise asserted a claim or defense not supported by material facts or would not be supported by existing law to those facts.” However, before a party may file the sanctions motion, the opposing party has 21 days to evaluate the assertion. When the non-moving party does notfile a paper that challenges the claim, nor does it have the opportunity to assert an oral argument, to challenge the claim defense or contention, there is nothing for the non-moving party to “withdraw.” Without such a filing, the motion for fees was premature. ORDER PREVENTING PLAINTIFFS FROM TAKING DISCOVERY TO LEARN THE CONTENTS OF EX-PARTE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN DEFENDANT AND PHYSICIAN WHO TREATED PLAINTIFF, DID NOT INFLICT THE KIND OF HARM THAT CAN BE REVIEWED BY CERTIORARI. In the course of preparing the case, the attorneys for the University had ex-parte contacts with a gastroenterologist who treated the plaintiff for problems resulting from the surgery at Mt. The plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of certiorari to quash the portion of the lower court’s order finding that any communication between Dr. Barkin and the University were privileged, and that ex-parte communications were permissible. While defendants may speak to a plaintiff’s treating physicians if they are employees of the defendant, the parties disagreed as to whether the case came within the ambit of that exception. Before the court would look at that issue, however, it looked at a detailed analysis of orders reviewable by certiorari. Additionally, there was no worry about future contacts between the defendant and the doctor because the order was limited, and at oral argument the defendant acknowledged that under the existing trial order there could be no future communications. CIRCUIT COURT APPELLATE DIVISION DEPARTED FROM THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF LAW IN FINDING THAT INSURER WAS REQUIRED TO PAY ADDITIONAL PIP BENEFITS AFTER THE $10,000 POLICY LIMITS WERE EXHAUSTED–THERE MUST BE A SHOWING OF BAD FAITH BEFORE AN INSURER CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR BENEFITS ABOVE THE STATUTORY LIMIT. Following the Fourth District’s decision in Northwood Sports Medicine, the court stated that a post-suit exhaustion of benefits should be treated no differently than a pre-suit exhaustion of benefits, even though Geico breached its contract by not paying plaintiff’s bills at the outset. The court allowed second-tier certiorari because it found that the appellate division’s ruling would potentially affect large numbers of claimants, as well as a large number of PIP claims processed by insurers. CLAIM THAT TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING A PLAINTIFF A NEW TRIAL ON PAST ECONOMIC DAMAGES ONLY, AND SHOULD HAVE ORDERED A NEW TRIAL ON BOTH LIABILITY AND DAMAGES WAS NOT PRESERVED, WHERE THE DEFENDANTS OPPOSED THE MOTION FOR ADDITITUR ONLY ON THE GROUND THAT THE JURY’S VERDICT WAS CORRECT AND FAILED TO CONTEND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDED A NEW TRIAL ON LIABILITY. The plaintiff moved for an additur or, in the alternative, a new trial on past non-economic damages, arguing that the one-dollar verdict on non-economic damages was not supported by the evidence in light of the uncontested evidence that he suffered as a result of his injuries and the award for medical expenses. Because the defendants argued that issue for the first time on appeal, the court found it was not preserved, and affirmed the trial court’s order granting the new trial on non-economic damages only. ERROR TO DISMISS A COMPLAINT AGAINST A STATE AGENCY BASED ON A FINDING THAT THE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PRE-SUIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER §768.28(6)(A). Because a trial court may not consider matters outside the four corners of the complaint, and did so in this case in finding there was not proper compliance with pre-suit notice requirements, it was error for the court to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint. The court provided the following rule of thumb: While an appeal is pending, the trial court retains jurisdiction with regard to those matters which do not interfere with the power and authority of the appellate court or the rights of a party to the appeal, under consideration by the appellate court.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional law.
