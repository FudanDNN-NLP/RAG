The term also refers to any embodiment, manifestation, incarnation, personification, appearance, image, idol or statue of a deity. The earliest mention of the term murti occurs in primary Upanishads composed in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly in verse 3.2 of Aitareya Upanishad, verse 1.13 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, verse 6.14 of Maitrayaniya Upanishad and verse 1.5 of Prashna Upanishad. The section sets out to prove \n\n murti as 'idol' is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it. It may be found inside or outside a temple or home, installed to be moved with a festive procession (utsava murti), or just be a landmark. It is a significant part of Hindu iconography, and is implemented in many ways. Two major categories include: Beyond anthropomorphic forms of religious murti, some traditions of Hinduism cherish aniconism, where alternate symbols are shaped into a murti, such as the linga for Shiva, yoni for Devi, and the saligrama for Vishnu. Murti (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, ISO: Mūrti; ) is a general term for an image, statue or idol of a deity or mortal in Hindu culture. Murti are also found in some nontheistic Jainism traditions, where they serve as symbols of revered mortals inside Jain temples, and are worshiped in murtipujaka rituals. Ancient era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas and Samhitas.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

With that said, Aristotle brings us somewhat closer an empirical science than his predecessors. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. However, where Herschel held that the origin of new biological species would be found in a natural rather than a miraculous process, Whewell opposed this and considered that no natural cause had been shown for adaptation so an unknown divine cause was appropriate. John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was stimulated to publish A System of Logic (1843) \n\n which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other than it is.\" It was therefore the work of the philosopher to demonstrate universal truths and to discover their causes. For this task Aristotle used the tool of deductive reasoning in the form of syllogisms. Aristotle developed a complete normative approach to scientific inquiry involving the syllogism, which he discusses at length\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

According to tradition, when Japan suffered a serious epidemic, the Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, suggested that the Emperor Saga personally copy an important Buddhist religious document called the Heart Sutra (Hannya Shingyō). The temple was built using the guidance of masters and artisans from the ancient Korean kingdom of Baekje. The Emperor Shōmu who had the temple originally built was a practitioner of Buddhism. This is important in that the Hogon-ji Temple was built in honor of the goddess Benzaiten, the Japanese adaptation of the Indian goddess Sarasvati, who is also the goddess of eloquence, learning, military prowess, and a musician. The original temple was rebuilt in 1602 so there is no real documentation on what it actually looked like. Amida Halls, however, did not reportedly start being built until around 1051 CE It is therefore apparent that the style of architecture changed \n\n Per the temples own history, it was founded in 702 AD by a holy ascetic, Ryūshū Sennin, who carved statues of Yakushi Nyōrai, Nikkō Bosatsu, Gakkō Bosatsu, the Jūni Shinshō, Shi-Tennō and other deities out of the living trucks of trees on Mount Hōrai. The temple was rebuilt in the Kamakura period by Minamoto no Yoritomo (who is also credited with building the 1425 stone steps), out of gratitude for sheltering him during the Heiji rebellion. The layout of Ōsaka's Shitennō-ji (see below) reflects the plan of Chongyimsa temple in Buyeo, capital of Paekche from 538 to 663. We know for certain that Soga no Umako built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 and 596.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

Whether the Enūma Eliš creation myth was created for the Akitu ritual, or vice versa, or neither, is unclear; nevertheless there are definite connections in subject matter between the myth and festival, and there is also evidence of the festival as celebrated during the neo-Babylonian period that correlates well with the Enūma Eliš myth. It has been suggested that ritual reading of the poem coincided with spring flooding of the Tigris or Euphrates following the melting of snow in mountainous regions upstream – this interpretation is supported by the defeat of the (watery being) Tiamat by Marduk. The orthodox view, most clearly expressed by George Glenn Cameron in 1941 and Franz Marius Theodor de Liagre Böhl in 1962, is that Babylon was harshly reprimanded, with Xerxes ruining the city, taking away the Statue of Marduk (Babylon's main cult image of Marduk), which in turn prevented the celebration of Akitu (the Babylonian New Year's festival, which required the statue's presence), splitting the large Babylonian satrapy (\"Babylon-and-across-the-River\") into two smaller provinces, and removing the title king of Babylon from his royal titulature. Other researchers, such as Hans-Jörg Schmid in 1981, further embellished the details of this \n\n The Nabonidus Chronicle appears to have been composed by the (Babylonian) priests of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. Julye Bidmead attributes the priests' hostility to Nabonidus's unsuccessful attempts to introduce the worship of the moon god Sîn. The chronicle is seen as part of a series of pro-Persian documents, including the Cyrus cylinder and Verse Account of Nabonidus, that attack Nabonidus for alleged religious infidelity and contrast his actions with those of Cyrus and Cambyses. The festival was also adopted in the Neo-Assyrian Empire following the destruction of Babylon. At the beginning of the 3rd century, it was still celebrated in Emessa, Syria, in honour of the god Elagabal. Since the Babylonian captivity, this month has mainly been called Nisan Kha b-Nisan is the name of the spring festival among the Assyrians.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

Sikhism asks all believers to take on godlike virtues, and this perhaps is the most godlike characteristic of all. Gurbani teaches that Waheguru is a \"loving God\" full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive, never hate anyone, and live in Waheguru's Hukam and practise compassion and humility. Akaal (or Akal) literally timeless, immortal, non-temporal, is a term integral to Sikh tradition and philosophy. It is extensively used in the Dasam Granth hymns by Guru Gobind Singh, who titled one of his poetic compositions Akal Ustat; i.e., In Praise (ustati) of the Timeless One (akaal). However, the concept of Akaal is not peculiar to the Dasam Granth. It goes back to the very origins of the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak used the term in the Mool Mantar, the fundamental creedal statement in the Japji, the first composition in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term occurs more frequently in Guru Arjan’s bani (e.g. Arohana: Sa Re Ma Pa Ni Sa ; Avarohana: Sa Re Ni Dha, Ma Pa Dha Ma Ga Re Ni Sa ; Vadi: Re ; Samavadi: Dha Sorath is an India musical raga (musical mode) that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

The fifth Guru, Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold \"22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity\", the Guru Granth. In the late seventeenth century, Guru Gobind Singh (the tenth Guru in Sikhism), was at war with the Mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.

The essential elements of the mantar are found in Guru Nanak's compositions, the various epithets he used for Akal Purakh (Ultimate Reality). In Sikhism, a sant, brahmgiani, or bhagat is any human being that has attained God realization and spiritual communion with God. Sikhs believe that the divine energy of God can be experienced by humans on Earth. This is attained through continual recitation and spiritual internalization of God's name (Naam Japo/Naam Simran). Sikhs commonly utilize Waheguru as the name of God which translates into \"Wondrous Guru\". Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Farid, Bhikkan and others are known as sants or bhagats, despite some being of Islam or Hindu faith.

Of these, the most cited one is Manusmriti, which describes the four Varnas, their rights and duties. Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas. Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. Bhrigu, in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas. Common examples of such use are pitri dharma (meaning a person's duty as a father), putra dharma (a person's duty as a son), raj dharma (a person's duty as a king) and so forth. The Dharmashastra is a record of these guidelines and rules. The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras. Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.

But, according to Mani, the original man is fundamentally distinct from the first father of the human race. The Gnostic doctrine of the identity of Adam, as the original man, with the Messiah appears in Mani in his teaching of the \"Redeeming Christ,\" who has His abode in the sun and moon, but is identical with the original man. It also appears in this theory that Adam was the first of the sevenfold series of true prophets, comprising Adam, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. Of this conception, however, there remains in the later Mandaean writings little more than the expression \"Gabra Ḳadmaya\" (Adam Ḳadmon). few records of their rituals or doctrines, and the link between them and Manichaeans is unclear. Regardless of its historical veracity the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to fit contemporary heresies with those combated by the church fathers. Not all Cathars held that The Evil God (or principle) was as powerful as The Good God (also called a principle) as Mani did, a belief also known as absolute dualism. In the case of the Cathars, it seems they adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization, but none of its religious cosmology.

Especially some lineages in the Rinzai school of Zen stress sudden insight, while the Sōtō school of Zen lays more emphasis on shikantaza, training awareness of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. A. Charles Muller explains that this method, which involved seeking enlightened wisdom through complete stillness of the mind, became \"the main practice of the Sōtō Zen school, where Dōgen characterized it by such terms of as 'just sitting' 只管打坐.\". Shikantaza's origins can also be traced back to silent illumination. The Buddha-nature and Yogacara philosophies have had a strong influence on Chán and Zen.

It is an important aspect in the Sikh way of life, where a free vegetarian meal is prepared and served to all who come to the door of the Guru. This practice serves as a practical demonstration and a reminder to Sikhs that everyone is equal, irrespective of their status – high or low, rich or poor – and that they should share their possessions with others. In Sikhism, a sant, brahmgiani, or bhagat is any human being that has attained God realization and spiritual communion with God. Sikhs believe that the divine energy of God can be experienced by humans on Earth. This is attained through continual recitation and spiritual internalization of God's name (Naam Japo/Naam Simran). ; Mandir: There is one mandir (temple), as well, where people hold programmes from time to time. Every year there is a programme held at the mosque; Qawwals attend and sing devotional music. The gurdwara was built to commemorate the site where Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, settled after his missionary work and did farming. It is therefore the second holiest site of the Sikh religion after Gurdwara Janam Asthan – the birthplace of Guru Nanak located in Nankana Sahib, Pakistan. Here, Guru Nanak gave the three principles of Kirat Karo, Naam Japo, Wand Chako, which means work hard for a livelihood, keep remembering the God and share your bounties with the world. Guru ka Langar ('Guru's free food') is a very important part of Sikhism.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements. Buddhism, Celestial Masters and fangshi all contributed to the religious canon of Lingbao. Sichuan was the origin of the Celestial Masters. Different beliefs were held by the different groups of Daoists. Building temples, effigies and fasting was practiced by Daoists to gain blessings. Celestial Masters north branch under Kou Qianzhi worshipped divinities described in the 魏書 Book of Wei.

The Quran itself calls Islam the \"religion of Abraham\" (Ibrahim) and refers to Jacob (Yaqub) and the Twelve Tribes of Israel as being Muslims. The Quran says: \"In matters of faith, He has laid down for you [people] the same commandment that He gave Noah, which We have revealed to \n\n adhesion of the disciple (murid). The religion of Islam founded by Muhammad in 7th century Arabia incorporated ideas from Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity, specifically monotheism, Last Judgment, Heaven and Hell. The doctrine of Islam is based on five pillars: Shahada, faith; Salat, prayer; Zakat, alms-giving; Sawm, fasting; and Hajj, pilgrimage. Starting from soon after its foundation, Islam has broken into several strands, including: \n\nThe Islamic faith promotes health and harmony of the mind, body, and soul for African American Muslims through its holistic approach to life. Islamic teachings encompass various aspects of well-being, including physical health, mental well-being, and spiritual growth. In the context of physical health, Islam encourages healthy living and self-care. The teachings of Islam encourage self-reflection, self-improvement, and the cultivation of positive character traits, which contribute to overall spiritual well-being. Islam offers a comprehensive approach to well-being, addressing the physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human existence. In Islam, the concept \"īthār\" (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of \"preferring others to oneself\". This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in īthār attention is focused on everything \n\n Jihad (جهاد) is an Islamic term referring to the religious duty of Muslims to maintain the religion. In Arabic, the word jihād is a noun meaning \"to strive, to apply oneself, to struggle, to persevere\".

There is no supernatural being applying its own will to determine someone's fate: \"[...] beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement.\" They are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right samadhi (mental unification, meditation). The goal taught by the Buddha, nirvana, literally means 'extinguishing' and signified \"the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power samsara. In early Buddhism, the concept of dependent origination was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena. The Buddha understood \n\n the doctrine of Dependent Origination according to which \"everything is without an essential nature (nissvabhava), and everything is empty of essential nature (svabhava-sunya)\", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism \n\n the Mystic Law. According to Nichiren, the word expresses both a Buddha's enlightenment and the delusions of a normal person, as they have the same essence. This represents the ability to thrive amidst the sufferings of daily life. [68] Since all things are empty of own-being, the incomparable Tathagata teaches dependent co-origination regarding things. In reality [the Tathagata] has not taught the Dharma. Not understanding the Tathagata's words, [fools] fear this spotless discourse.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about world religions.
