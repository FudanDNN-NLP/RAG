In atoms and molecules the charge of the electrons is distributed in clouds called orbitals which surround the atom or molecule, and are responsible for chemical bonds. The above general remarks about surface charge are made more concrete by considering the example of a dielectric sphere in a uniform electric field. The sphere is found to adopt a surface charge related to the dipole moment of its interior. In electromagnetism, charge density is the amount of electric charge per unit length, surface area, or volume.

Shortening the string also reduces its mass, but does not alter the mass per unit length, and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency. The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by √T/m, where T is the tension and m is the mass per unit length; there is a node at either end of the vibrating length, and thus the vibrating length l is half a wavelength.

For ideal inductors, this relationship is linear, so that the inductance value at an arbitrary frequency can be calculated from the inductance value measured at some reference frequency. When a battery is first connected across the circuit, the current initially flows through the branch with the capacitor, causing the voltage across it to start changing. However, as time progresses, the current through the capacitor decreases while the current through the resistor increases. This changing current pattern causes the rate of voltage change across both the capacitor and resistor to slow down. The resistance determines the flow of current through the circuit, while the capacitance affects the storage and release of electrical charge. The oriented dipoles will be discharged spontaneously over time and the voltage at the electrodes of the capacitor will decay exponentially. from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging. This ambiguity in the anode and cathode designation causes confusion in battery engineering, as is necessary to have the anode and cathode associated with unique physical components. The common convention is to name the electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge as the anode or the negative (-) electrode and the electrode that absorbs the electrons as the cathode or the positive (+). Naming the physical electrodes as positive (+) or negative \n\n To keep the input voltage as stable as possible, it is essential that the capacitor have very low leakage, and that it not be loaded to any significant degree which calls for a very high input impedance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school physics.

The amount of centripetal force required to cause an object to move along a circular path with a radius of 6378 kilometres (the Earth's equatorial radius), at 465 m/s, is about 0.034 newtons per kilogram of mass. The amount of suspension force required is the mass of the internal weight (multiplied by the acceleration of gravity) minus those 0.34 newtons.

The frequency of oscillation at x is proportional to the momentum p(x) of a classical particle of energy En and position x. Furthermore, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is inversely proportional to p(x) , reflecting the length of time the classical particle spends near x.

A modern statement is: Avogadro's law states that \"equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules.\" For a given mass of an ideal gas, the volume and amount (moles) of the gas are directly proportional if the temperature and pressure are constant. The law is named after Amedeo Avogadro who, in 1812, hypothesized that two given samples of an ideal gas, of the same volume and at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. As an example, equal volumes of gaseous hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same number of atoms when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and observe ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists. In the kinetic theory of gases, the pressure is assumed to be equal to the force (per unit area) exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from the gas container's surface. Consider a gas of a large number N of molecules, each of mass m, enclosed in a cube of volume V = L3. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the x axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an elastic collision), the change in momentum is given by: This is an important, non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a macroscopic property, to the translational kinetic energy of the molecules, which is a microscopic property.

This relationship can be explained by considering the behavior of gas molecules in a closed system. Conversely, when the volume of the system increases, there is more space for the gas molecules to spread out. They collide with each other and with the walls of the container less frequently, resulting in a lower force per unit area and therefore a decrease in pressure. Boyle's law can be mathematically expressed as P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 represent the initial pressure and volume respectively, and P2 and V2 represent the final pressure and volume respectively. In summary, Boyle's law describes how changes in volume affect gas pressure within a closed system when temperature and moles remain constant.

The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29 °C, compared to 69 °C for the hydrocarbon hexane, and 34.6 °C for diethyl ether. For example, with methanol:  Upon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 elimination reaction to produce alkenes. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature. This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce ethylene:  A more controlled elimination reaction requires the formation of the xanthate ester. With increasing cluster size the oxygen to oxygen distance is found to decrease which is attributed to so-called cooperative many-body interactions: due to a change in charge distribution the H-acceptor molecule becomes a better H-donor molecule with each expansion of the water assembly. Two cage-like isomers exist for heptamers (H2O)7, and octamers (H2O)8 are found either cyclic \n\nThe evaporation rate of water-ethylene glycol liquid mixtures is influenced by several factors. This is because higher temperatures provide more energy to the molecules, leading to increased kinetic motion and evaporation. This trend is attributed to the ideal mixing behavior of the two components, where the presence of ethylene glycol molecules hinders the evaporation of water molecules. It is important to note that the evaporation rates were examined in relation to the surface tension of the liquid mixture, but no definite relation between them was found. This suggests that the composition of the mixture at the surface plays a significant role in influencing the evaporation rate and activation energy. The common explanation for this phenomenon is that smaller cubes have greater surface area, and this greater area causes greater heat conduction and therefore faster cooling. For a given volume of ice, the total surface area of the ice is proportional to so that the cooling time is proportional to the length scale of the ice cube squared, not just the length scale.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school physics.

For rigid bodies, angular acceleration must be caused by a net external torque. However, this is not so for non-rigid bodies: For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms and legs inwards, which involves no external torque. Another method for solving such sphere problems was to write down the coordinates together with the sphere's radius. This was employed by Lie (1871) in the context of Lie sphere geometry which represents a general framework of sphere-transformations (being a special case of contact transformations) conserving lines of curvature and transforming spheres into spheres. Since the radius of a sphere can have a positive or negative sign, one sphere always corresponds to two transformed spheres. It is advantageous to remove this ambiguity by attributing a definite sign to the radius, consequently giving the spheres a definite orientation too, so that one \n\n In the example shown in the diagram opposite, a single force.

At the instant shown, the force gives to the disc the angular acceleration α = τ /I = 7,5 rad/s2, and to its center of mass it gives the linear acceleration a = F/m = 4 m/s2.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school physics.

All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s2. The General Conference on Weights and Measures fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665 m/s2 so that disciplines such as metrology would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and pressures. In reality, gravitational acceleration (symbol: g) varies slightly with latitude, elevation \n\n  The gravity of Earth, denoted by g, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation).
