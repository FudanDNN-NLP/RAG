Most of these viruses are very common and typically asymptomatic in most human populations studied. BK virus is associated with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus with Merkel cell cancer. Structure and genome\n\nPolyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with circular genomes of around 5000 base pairs. The capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres of a protein called VP1, which is capable of self-assembly into a closed icosahedron; each pentamer of VP1 is associated with one molecule of one of the other two capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3. The genome of a typical polyomavirus codes for between 5 and 9 proteins, divided into two transcriptional regions called the early and late regions due to the time during infection in which they are transcribed. Each region is transcribed by the host cell's RNA polymerase II as a single pre-messenger RNA containing multiple genes. Additional genes and other variations on this theme are present in some viruses: for example, rodent polyomaviruses have a third protein called middle tumor antigen in the early region, which is extremely efficient at inducing cellular transformation; SV40 has an additional capsid protein VP4; some examples have an additional regulatory protein called agnoprotein expressed from the late region. Cellular receptors for polyomaviruses are sialic acid residues of glycans, commonly gangliosides. The attachment of polyomaviruses to host cells is mediated by the binding of VP1 to sialylated glycans on the cell surface. In some particular viruses, additional cell-surface interactions occur; for example, the JC virus is believed to require interaction with the 5HT2A receptor and the Merkel cell virus with heparan sulfate. However, in general virus-cell interactions are mediated by commonly occurring molecules on the cell surface, and therefore are likely not a major contributor to individual viruses' observed cell-type tropism. The details of transit to the nucleus are not clear and may vary among individual polyomaviruses. It has been frequently reported that an intact, albeit distorted, virion particle is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell cytoplasm, where the genome is released from the capsid, possibly due to the low calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. Both expression of viral genes and replication of the viral genome occur in the nucleus using host cell machinery. The precise mechanism of this dysregulation depends on the virus; for example, SV40 LT can directly bind host cell p53, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. As these interactions begin, the LTs belonging to several polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, present oncogenic potential. Taxonomy\nThe polyomaviruses are members of group I (dsDNA viruses). The classification of polyomaviruses has been the subject of several proposed revisions as new members of the group are discovered. Formerly, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, which share many structural features but have very different genomic organizations, were classified together in the now-obsolete family Papovaviridae. (The name Papovaviridae derived from three abbreviations: Pa for Papillomavirus, Po for Polyomavirus, and Va for \"vacuolating.\") The polyomaviruses were divided into three major clades (that is, genetically-related groups): the SV40 clade, the avian clade, and the murine polyomavirus clade. A subsequent proposed reclassification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recommended dividing the family of Polyomaviridae into three genera:\n Genus Orthopolyomavirus (type species SV40)\n Genus Wukipolyomavirus (type species KI polyomavirus)\n Genus Avipolyomavirus (type species Avian polyomavirus)\n\nThe current ICTV classification system recognises six genera and 117 species, of which five could not be assigned a genus. This system retains the distinction between avian and mammalian viruses, grouping the avian subset into the genus Gammapolyomavirus. The six genera are:\n Alphapolyomavirus\n Betapolyomavirus\n Deltapolyomavirus\n Epsilonpolyomavirus\n Gammapolyomavirus\n Zetapolyomavirus\n\nThe following species are unassigned to a genus:\n Centropristis striata polyomavirus 1\n Rhynchobatus djiddensis polyomavirus 1\n Sparus aurata polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus bernacchii polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus pennellii polyomavirus 1\n\nDescription of additional viruses is ongoing. Human polyomaviruses \nMost polyomaviruses do not infect humans. Of the polyomaviruses cataloged as of 2017, a total of 14 were known with human hosts. However, some polyomaviruses are associated with human disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Lyon IARC polyomavirus is related to raccoon polyomavirus. List of human polyomaviruses\nThe following 14 polyomaviruses with human hosts had been identified and had their genomes sequenced as of 2017:\n\nDeltapolyomavirus contains only the four human viruses shown in the above table. The Alpha and Beta groups contain viruses that infect a variety of mammals. Antibodies to the monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus have been detected in humans suggesting that this virus - or a closely related virus - can infect humans. Clinical relevance\nAll the polyomaviruses are highly common childhood and young adult infections. Diseases caused by human polyomavirus infections are most common among immunocompromised people; disease associations include BK virus with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus (MCV) with Merkel cell cancer. Competition assays are frequently needed to distinguish among highly similar polyomaviruses. There are three main diagnostic techniques used for the diagnosis of the reactivation of polyomavirus in polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN): urine cytology, quantification of the viral load in both urine and blood, and a renal biopsy. History \nMurine polyomavirus was the first polyomavirus discovered, having been reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 as an extract of mouse leukemias capable of inducing parotid gland tumors. The causative agent was identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy, after whom it was once called \"SE polyoma\". The term \"polyoma\" refers to the viruses' ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma) under certain conditions. The name has been criticized as a \"meatless linguistic sandwich\" (\"meatless\" because both morphemes in \"polyoma\" are affixes) giving little insight into the viruses' biology; in fact, subsequent research has found that most polyomaviruses rarely cause clinically significant disease in their host organisms under natural conditions. Dozens of polyomaviruses have been identified and sequenced as of 2017, infecting mainly birds and mammals. A total of fourteen polyomaviruses are known to infect humans.

The first and largest of these was the People With AIDS Health Group (PWA Health Group), founded in 1986 by Thomas Hannan, Joseph Sonnabend, and Michael Callen. AIDS buyers clubs distributed such unapproved drugs as ribavirin, dextran sulfate, and DCNB (dinitrochlorobenzene), as well as cheaper pirated versions of zidovudine (AZT), which was the first drug that was FDA-approved for the treatment of AIDS. AIDS buyers clubs also distributed information about the disease and drug developments, and became an important source of AIDS treatment education and advocacy. An example of an AIDS buyers club was drawn to wider prominence with the 2013 film release Dallas Buyers Club. minutes, Koop, who had not known about the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS among minorities, sat riveted by NMAC's representatives for nearly two and half hours. The agency incorporated in 1987, and later launched the groundbreaking social marketing campaign, \"Live Long Sugar\", with Patti LaBelle, which alerted people of color living with HIV/AIDS about the dangers of the common HIV co-infection, Pneumocystis carnii pneumonia (PNP). In 1989, NMAC partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help build the capacity of small faith- and community-based organizations (F/CBOs) delivering HIV/AIDS services in communities of color. This changed the mission of \n\nThe Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was a law passed by the United States Congress in 1992 which allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from drug manufacturers to fund the new drug approval process. The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities. All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992.

The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities. All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992.

Child mortality is not only caused by infection and disorder: it is also caused by premature birth; birth defect; new born infection; birth complication; and diseases like malaria, sepsis, and diarrhea. In less developed countries, malnutrition is the main cause of child mortality. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 deaths before the age of 5 while nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under-nutrition. Some of the deadliest diseases in the world that can be minimized or prevented through education, public health practices, prevention, and adequate treatment include:\n\n1. Malaria: Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted through mosquito bites. It leads to major health problems and claims at least a million lives every year. TB claimed approximately 1.4 million lives in 2011. Prevention involves vaccinating infants at high risk and ensuring appropriate treatment to control and prevent the spread of the disease. Lower Respiratory Infections: This category includes pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Prevention involves controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking, as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle. It is primarily caused by smoking and exposure to pollutants. Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It contributes to millions of deaths annually. Public awareness campaigns, strict enforcement of traffic laws, improving road infrastructure, and advocating safe driving practices are essential to minimize the impact of road traffic injuries. While each of these diseases requires a multifaceted approach, education, public health practices, prevention, and appropriate treatment play crucial roles in minimizing their impact and preventing unnecessary deaths.

It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse \n\nThat time of the month again? The common cold is easily transferable because it is an upper respiratory infection caused by rhinovirus, or other viruses. It is more commonly caused by rhinovirus, because there are more than 100 different types of rhinoviruses which all have a human reservoir; meaning they only house their infections within a human host. The pathogenesis (the ability to cause disease) of a rhinovirus occurs after the incubation period which is usually 1-2 days after encountering the virus. The epithelial cells eventually lyse (burst) releasing large numbers of virus particles into your upper respiratory tract (URT). This cycle repeats continuously and the rhinovirus has the ability to infect the overwhelming amounts of epithelial cells present in your pharynx. As cells die, the release of protein signalling molecules called cytokines recruit leukocytes (white-blood cells) to the site of infection. As the battle between the exponential growth of the virus and the human leukocytes occurs, the symptoms of the common cold are experienced. Often you experience these symptoms because your immune system is trying to battle the virus and clear the infection. When a virus infects a cell, it often inactivates the movement of these tiny hair-like projections on cells which prevent pathogens from entering your lower respiratory tract (LRT). When the ciliary motion (mucociliary escalator) is inactivated due to the increasing amount cell death, the strength of your coughs and sneezes are used to push these pathogens up and out of your URT. Only 1 case of rhinovirus was observed because it is not as harmful to a healthy individual and is often cleared within two weeks. The lower respiratory tract is sterile and infections in the LRT are often more severe than infections in the URT. Influenza and RSV are both viruses affecting the lower respiratory tract and are far more damaging to the host than rhinovirus. Influenza has an incubation period of roughly 2 days before the onset of symptoms. The pathogenesis of influenza is similar to the rhinovirus as they both multiply within epithelial cells and suppress the mucociliary escalator. There are three types of influenza virus; influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. The letters indicate severity based on the protein coat that the influenza virus possesses. Type A is more severe for humans, as compared to type B and C. Influenza is a unique virus, as it has the ability to change. On the protein coat, influenza has glycoprotein spikes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA glycoproteins are antigens which are often recognised by your immune system as pathogenic. The protein antigens found on the virus in the previous year are completely different from the protein antigens found on the seasonal influenza virus currently, thus making you sick every year. This is known as antigenic drift. The treatment of influenza includes some antiviral mediation, only if it is given at an appropriate time and there are also multivalent vaccines. There have been more reported cases for RSV than influenza and rhinoviruses because it is not necessarily more pathogenic but has a different approach as to how it infects its host and the type of symptoms experienced. The pathogenesis of RSV is slightly different from influenza and rhinovirus because although it may also infect epithelium of the respiratory tract, it causes the bronchioles of the lungs to be partially plugged from the dead sloughed cells of the epithelium. Due to the nature of some RSV virus proteins, it can sometimes be fatal for the elderly population that have underlying conditions. Currently, there few effective antiviral medications available for this infection. Doctors will give the premature babies injections of antibodies to RSV so that this vulnerable population develops a passive immunity. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. The risk \n\nThe typical symptoms of the mumps virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The incubation period of mumps is usually around 19 days, but it can range from 7 to 23 days. Infected individuals can shed the virus from 1 week before to 1 week after symptom onset, with the highest contagiousness occurring 1 to 2 days before the symptoms appear. The virus can spread to multiple organs, including the salivary glands, testes, pancreas, ovaries, mammary glands, and central nervous system (CNS). The exact mechanism of mumps encephalitis is still unclear, but it is believed to be a secondary process resulting from respiratory spread and parainfectious inflammation. It's important to practice good hygiene and ensure vaccination to prevent the spread of mumps.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\n UNICEF and WHO recommended that children be exclusively breastfed (no other liquid, solid food, or plain water) during the first six months of life (WHO/UNICEF, 2002). The nutrition program under the 2004 National Nutrition Policy and Strategy promotes exclusive breastfeeding through the age of 6 months and, thereafter, the introduction of semisolid or solid foods along with continued breast milk until the child is at least age 2. Introducing breast milk substitutes to infants before age 6 months can contribute to breastfeeding failure. After six months, a child requires adequate complementary foods for normal growth. in table below) 84.7% of normal delivery participants did not feed anything other than breast milk to their babies while 78% of C-sectioned participants fed formula to their babies after they had started breastfeeding. The participants assumed that formula-fed babies were more likely to gain weight more quickly than breastfed babies. Exclusive breastfeeding has always been considered as an ideal food for the baby up to six months after birth. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is the recommended way of feeding infants, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years or beyond. The reason for participants to not practice breastfeeding within an hour were mother's sickness, unable to hold the baby due to suture, baby taken away from mother, and less or no production of breast milk soon after surgery to feed the child. The reliance on formula-feeding may also increase mortality from other causes, which could offset the advantage of reduced mortality from HIV. This means that the baby should receive only breast milk for the first few months of life, without any additional liquids or solids. In cases where complete avoidance of breast-feeding is not possible or recommended, formula-feeding can be a safe alternative for HIV-infected mothers in developing countries. The aforementioned clinical trial conducted in Kenya showed that formula-feeding led to similar rates of diarrhea, pneumonia, and overall mortality as compared to breast-feeding in this population. To summarize, while complete avoidance of breast-feeding may not always be feasible in developing countries for HIV-infected mothers, there are strategies to mitigate the risks. In cases where formula-feeding is necessary, proper education, access to clean water, and sanitation facilities are vital to ensure a safe alternative to breast-feeding.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

They also noted that a community of innovation (COI) may be specialized in one function like a community of practice (COP). An example is an innovation \n\n Acculturation is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed. Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction. ; 2) Community – When people find an individual or a group that shares the same values, likes, beliefs, etc., they find community. When this commitment happens, they tend to follow the same trends as a group and when one member introduces a new idea or product, it is accepted more readily based on the previous trust that has been established.

It involves providing incentives or rewards to individuals who demonstrate specific behaviors, such as abstinence from drugs, reduction in drug misuse, or adherence to interventions that improve physical health outcomes. The main goal of contingency management is to promote positive behavior change and ultimately reduce illicit drug use. There are several concerns regarding contingency management that need to be addressed. However, it is important to note that contingency management focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are consistent with recovery and sobriety, rather than rewarding drug use itself. Another concern is whether the effects of contingency management can be maintained in the long term. However, implementing strategies for ongoing support and monitoring can help address this issue and increase the likelihood of sustained positive outcomes. Additionally, there are concerns about potential abuse of the system, as individuals may attempt to cheat their drug tests in order to receive incentives. It's important to consider that while most research on contingency management has been conducted in the United States, there have also been studies conducted in Europe and Australia which provide additional evidence for its effectiveness. By incorporating evidence-based practices from various studies conducted globally, contingency management can be effectively utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing drug misuse and promoting positive behavior change.

Six cases of Spondweni virus infections have been well documented, and the signs and symptoms parallel closely \n\nAstroviruses are a type of virus that was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle\nAstroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome\n\nAstroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution\nThe Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus \nMamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans\nMembers of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or transmission method for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Pathogenesis\nAstroviruses cause gastroenteritis by causing destruction of the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not affect astrovirus pathogenesis. Epidemiology\nAstroviruses are associated with 5–9% of the cases of gastroenteritis in young children. Humans of all ages are susceptible to astrovirus infection, but children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are most prone. Studies in the USA have detected astroviruses in the stools of 2–9% of children presenting symptoms; illness is most frequent in children younger than two years, although outbreaks among adults and the elderly have been reported. The occurrence of astrovirus infections vary depending on the season. Human astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal–oral route. The main mode of astrovirus transmission is by contaminated food and water. Astroviruses can also be transmitted to humans from other animal species. Furthermore, some human, duck, chicken and turkey astroviruses are phylogenetically related and share genetic features.

It is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. When a foreign substance, also known as an antigen, enters the body, specialized cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognize and capture the antigen. These immune complexes help in neutralizing the foreign substances and targeting them for elimination by other immune cells, such as macrophages. The immune system also has a remarkable ability to remember previous encounters with antigens. This is known as immunological memory. When the body is exposed to the same antigen again, memory T cells and B cells rapidly respond, leading to a quicker and more effective immune response. This memory response is the basis for the effectiveness of vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to create an immunological memory without causing the disease. In summary, the immune system recognizes foreign substances through specialized cells, mounts an immune response tailored to that particular substance, and neutralizes them through the production of antibodies, immune complexes, and the activation of other immune cells. Its ability to remember previous encounters allows for a faster and more efficient response upon re-exposure to the same antigen. At the prenatal and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. An untreated vertebrate C with self antigens denoted C is believed to have a one-dimensional axis of lymphocytes that is defined by co-selection of anti-C and anti-anti-C lymphocytes. different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune response.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

There are currently seven drugs approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, including injectable interferon (IFN) α, pegylated interferon (PEG IFN), and various oral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. While clinical trials often focus on short-term outcomes achieved over 1-2 years, these gains have long-term implications in reducing the risk of clinical progression, hepatic decompensation, and death. Although standard IFN is no longer used to treat hepatitis B, it played a significant role historically and provided important insights into antiviral therapy in general. Reference:\n- Chronic Hepatitis B. (Source: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 20e)\n\n Since hepatitis B and C are some of the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma, prevention of infection is key to then prevent HCC. Similarly, the addition of cisplatin to adjuvant chemotherapy led to a marked increase in disease-free survival rates for patients with medulloblastoma - again, up to around 85%. This application of cisplatin was developed by pediatric oncologist Roger Packer in the early 1980s. •Sirolimus: Also known as rapamycin, this oral medication suppresses the immune system and slows the growth of abnormal lymphatic vessels that form the tumor. This can help shrink EHE tumors and improve symptoms, including pain •Tyrosine kinase inhibitors: These drugs, designed as targeted therapies for cancers, have shown short-term success with EHE. Examples include sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib. •Multi-agent chemotherapy: EHE tumors that grow rapidly, spread to other tissues or do not respond to other medications may require more aggressive drug therapy. •Others like surgery can be done as treatment for the virus during its most severe. SINEs have been tested in several preclinical animal models of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, lymphomas, and acute and chronic leukemias. In humans, early clinical trials (phase I) have been conducted in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, blast crisis, and a wide range of advanced or refractory solid tumors, including colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.

On Friday, 8 August 2014, following the occurrence of Ebola in the United States and Europe and with the already intense transmission ongoing in three other countries for months, the WHO declared its third PHEIC in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa. Later, one review showed that a direct impact of this epidemic on America escalated a PHEIC declaration. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus \n\n spread to Guinea, Liberia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Italy, the United States, and more. They funded $20,000 to a radio station in Sierra Leone to keep the people informed about the virus and the precautions that they could take in order to avoid it. In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Even though it looked like they were not progressing, Scientists made huge efforts \n\n and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In 1958, Harry Rubin and Howard Temin developed an assay where chicken embryo fibroblasts could be altered morphologically by RSV infection. Two years later Temin concluded that the transformed morphology of the cells was controlled by a genetic property \n\nA relative of HTLV-I, HTLV-II has been associated with a few rare cases of T-cell malignancies, including hairy cell leukemia, but its precise role in these diseases remains unclear.The discovery of reverse transcriptase in 1970 by two American virologists, David Baltimore and Howard Temin, earned them a Nobel Prize in Medicine. There are two major groups of retroviruses that infect humans: the **oncoretroviruses** ( _onco-_ , \"related to a tumor\") and the **lentiviruses** ( _lenti-_ , \"slow\"). There are several other groups of retroviruses that infect animals. Endogenous retrovirus sequences are found throughout the human genome. Like most enveloped viruses, all retroviruses are highly susceptible to factors that affect surface tension and are thus not transmissible through air, dust, or fomites under normal conditions, but instead require intimate contact with the infecting sources, such as bodily fluids, blood, and blood-derived products. Enveloped (+) RNA viruses that encode reverse transcriptase enzyme, which converts retroviral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA\n\nMembers of the oncoretrovirus, a subgroup of retroviruses, have long been associated with a variety of cancers in animals, including leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas. However, an oncoretrovirus was discovered in the late 1970s that infects humans known as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). During the 1960s, two findings emerged: replication-competent isolated viruses were related to RSV, but were non-transforming, and an isolated replication-defective strain of RSV was transformation-competent. Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the significance of his discovery in 1966. Subsequently, other oncogenic human viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, were discovered. Furthermore, oncogenes were found initially in retroviruses and then in cells. Gallo and his colleagues then opened and pioneered the field of human retrovirology with the discovery of the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) and along with Japanese investigators showed it was a cause of a particular form of human leukemia. A year later he and his group discovered the second known human retrovirus (HTLV-2). In 1986 he and his co-workers discovered human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), the first new herpes virus found in more than 25 years and the cause of Roseola. Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Syndromic Surveillance: Syndromic surveillance systems monitor the signs and symptoms of diseases instead of waiting for laboratory confirmation. This can include monitoring emergency department visits, over-the-counter medication sales, or school absenteeism rates to detect outbreaks or public health emergencies. Survey-Based Surveillance: Public health departments may conduct surveys to gather information on various health issues. Environmental Monitoring: Public health departments also monitor environmental factors that impact health, such as air and water quality, food safety, and workplace hazards. This surveillance helps identify and address potential health risks in the community. These surveillance systems, among others, assist public health departments in collecting timely and accurate data to inform decision-making and interventions aimed at protecting and promoting the health of the population. Public health surveillance (also epidemiological surveillance, clinical surveillance or syndromic surveillance) is, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"the continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.\" Public health surveillance may be used to track emerging health-related issues at an early stage and find active solutions in a timely manner. Surveillance systems are generally called upon to provide information regarding when and where health problems are occurring and who is affected. Public health surveillance systems can be passive or active. Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination. Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States. Syndromic surveillance\n\nSyndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate disease outbreaks. According to a CDC definition, \"the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials.\" The first indications of disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns. When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process. A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by Gunther Eysenbach, who began work on such a system in 2004. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modeling from Google search queries have been proposed. Search trends provide indirect data on public health, while the latter two methods provide direct data. Wikipedia has also been used, though it is potentially prone to \"noise\", as it is a popular source of health information whether a user is ill or not. This methodology has also been used by Public Health England in the United Kingdom as one of their syndromic surveillance endpoints. It is the most used social media platform for public health surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance\nSome conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance because it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.

The current data collection and surveillance methods are through the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). However there is very low usage of this system as paper-based records are lost in delivery, poor quality of data(inaccurate statistical data), untimely delivery of HMIS reports, exclusion of data from the private health providers and at the community level, inadequate segregation of HMIS data and limited political support. Lack of functional supply chains and adequate reporting around \n\nThe field of epidemiology has evolved significantly over time, building upon the foundational work of pioneers such as Hippocrates, Semmelweis, and John Snow. The specific techniques employed depend on the type of disease being studied, but there are some common approaches that are frequently used. One commonly employed approach is surveillance. This involves systematically collecting data on cases of a particular disease within a defined population or geographical area. Surveillance can be passive, relying on reports from healthcare providers or laboratories, or active, where researchers actively seek out cases through surveys or other means. In these studies, individuals who are initially free from the disease of interest are followed over time to assess their risk of developing the condition. These studies involve comparing individuals with a certain disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls), and examining differences in exposures or characteristics between the two groups. These involve collecting data at a single point in time from individuals within a population or community. They examine associations between exposure levels and health outcomes across different populations or geographical areas. By employing these methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into disease patterns, risk factors, and potential interventions to improve public health. Real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system (RODS) is a syndromic surveillance system developed by the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biomedical Informatics. It is \"prototype developed at the University of Pittsburgh where real-time clinical data from emergency departments within a geographic region can be integrated to provide an instantaneous picture of symptom patterns and early detection of epidemic events.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

The eradication of all poliomyelitis will require successful cessation of all oral polio vaccine use and containment of all sources of poliovirus, including circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. It is highly infectious and caused by three types of wild polio viruses: type 1, type 2, and type 3. To prevent polio, immunization is crucial. Polio vaccines are available in two forms: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). It helps protect against infection caused by wild (naturally occurring) polio viruses. On the other hand, IPV is an injectable vaccine that contains inactivated (killed) polio viruses and provides immunity against all three types of polio virus. It not only protects individuals from acquiring the infection but also helps in preventing the transmission of the polio virus within communities. In many parts of the world, widespread vaccination campaigns have successfully eliminated polio transmission. However, it is important to continue immunization efforts to maintain this progress and prevent polio resurgence. It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the contamination of a specific batch of oral polio vaccine in some regions. Ongoing human disease eradication efforts sanctioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) target dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) and all remaining circulating polioviruses that cause poliomyelitis, including type 1 wild poliovirus. Prior abandoned WHO-sanctioned human disease eradication efforts targeted yaws and malaria. For example, in the United States, the reported polio cases dropped from approximately 20,000 to below 2,500 within a few years of polio vaccine introduction, and widespread adoption of polio vaccine led to substantial health and financial benefits ). In 2016, the formulation of the OPV was changed to remove the already extinct and most problematic type 2 polio strain from the OPV.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

To consolidate such a large segment of moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, it can be said that healthcare itself is a \"special\" institution within society. Increasingly, medical ethics deems such actions to be medical paternalism, and they are discouraged in modern medicine. A hypothetical example demonstrates the increased engagement of a patient operating in a Health 2.0 setting: a patient goes to see their primary care physician with a presenting complaint, having first ensured their own medical record was up to date via the Internet. The treating physician might make a diagnosis or send for tests, the results of \n\nWhen implementing National Health Data Warehouses (NHDWHs) in low- and middle-income countries, there are several key ethical issues that need to be considered. Privacy is an important ethical concern when implementing NHDWHs. Informed consent and trust are also critical considerations. Secondary data use is another ethical issue. Sustainability and implementation validity are important ethical considerations as well. Any potential conflicts of interest should be identified and addressed to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. By considering privacy, informed consent and trust, confidentiality and security, secondary data use, sustainability and implementation validity, risk-benefit ratio, governance and conflict of interest, justice, equity, access, and collaborative partnerships, countries and implementers can make informed decisions and create ethical frameworks to guide the implementation of NHDWHs within LMICs. Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, \"nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning,\" whereby it is \"the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice.\" This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision. controversial due to their association with eugenics. As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy, history, and sociology. Medical ethics encompasses beneficence, autonomy, and justice as they relate to conflicts such as euthanasia, patient confidentiality, informed consent, and conflicts of interest in healthcare. In addition, medical ethics and culture are interconnected as different cultures implement ethical values differently, sometimes placing more emphasis on family values and downplaying the importance of autonomy. This leads to an increasing need for culturally sensitive physicians and ethical committees in hospitals and other healthcare settings.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Thus, childhood vaccination against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future. Yunupingu had been living with chronic hepatitis B since early in life, and experienced complications of this condition including liver and kidney disease. Hepatitis B infections, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, are unacceptably high in Indigenous Australians. Interestingly, hepatitis B used to be known as the “Australia Antigen” as it was first discovered in Australian Aboriginal people in the 1960s. Of the nearly 240,000 Australians estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B, over 20,000 are thought to be Indigenous people. New infections with hepatitis B remain three times as common in Indigenous people as in non-Indigenous Australians. Around 90% of those who were exposed as infants develop chronic hepatitis B, but only 5% of those who were exposed as adults will develop chronic infection. Most people living with chronic hepatitis B were infected as young children – often, through mother-to-child transmission at the time of birth. The prevalence of chronic (long-term) hepatitis B in Indigenous Australians varies significantly between regions. The prevalence of hepatitis B and other communicable diseases such as skin infections and influenza in Indigenous communities is intensified by the social, economic, environmental and political situation in which Indigenous Australians find themselves. Chronic liver disease contributes significantly to the Indigenous life expectancy gap. In the NT, a range of factors contribute to the unequal burden of liver cancer in Indigenous Australians, but hepatitis B is the most important cause. A safe, effective vaccine for hepatitis B has been provided for all infants in Australia since 2000 – and in the Northern Territory since 1990. As a result, new hepatitis B infections in children born since 2000, as well as those who received adolescent catch-up vaccination from 1998 onwards, have fallen markedly. However, funded hepatitis B vaccine for Indigenous adults is available only in some states and territories. It is believed over 90,000 Australians living with hepatitis B have never been diagnosed and are unaware of their infection. Only 15% of those infected are receiving treatment or monitoring for their condition. Unlike hepatitis C, hepatitis B is not yet curable, but current treatments are very well tolerated and effective at preventing liver disease and liver cancer. The profound lack of access to treatment and care among Indigenous people contributes to the disproportionate impact of hepatitis B on this population. Under the management of Miwatj Health, an Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation, a hepatitis specialist visits regularly three to four times per year. Several other regions in the world with large Indigenous populations and high hepatitis B prevalence, such as Alaska and New Zealand, have developed programs to test most of the population and identify those with hepatitis B infections. Also important is partnering with communities and their health workers to develop new ways of building awareness of hepatitis B as an important health issue. With comprehensive public health initiatives, long-term commitment to funding and policy – including significant workforce development to ensure as many people as possible are tested and appropriately followed up – the impact of hepatitis B on Indigenous communities can be eliminated. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations – infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death, the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (median survival time) in sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. In Japan, chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. The Hepatitis B Foundation is a nonprofit organization that provides resources and information about hepatitis B, engages in public health outreach campaigns, and leads public policy initiatives.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.
