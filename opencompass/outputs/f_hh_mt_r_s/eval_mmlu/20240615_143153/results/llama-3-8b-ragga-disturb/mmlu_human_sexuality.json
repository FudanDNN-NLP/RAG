There are several key factors related to mammography that are important to consider when discussing its potential risks and benefits. It is important to note that while mammography does involve exposure to a low level of radiation, the benefits of early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer often outweigh this risk. It plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer, as it can detect abnormalities such as lumps or calcifications before they can be felt during a physical examination. Early detection leads to earlier treatment and improved outcomes for patients. While it is true that mammography does involve exposure to radiation, the level of radiation used is generally very low. The amount of radiation exposure from a mammogram is comparable to the radiation exposure an individual receives from natural sources in the environment over a few months. In addition, modern mammography machines and techniques have been refined and optimized to minimize radiation exposure while still providing high-quality images. In conclusion, while mammography does involve exposure to low levels of radiation, the benefits of early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer often outweigh this risk. Other tests, such as a skin check for skin cancer, have no significant risk of harm to the patient. A test that has high potential harms \n\n  In medicine, breast imaging is a sub-speciality of diagnostic radiology that involves imaging of the breasts for screening or diagnostic purposes. There are various methods of breast imaging using a variety of technologies as described in detail below. Xeromammography and Galactography also use x-ray technology and are also used infrequently in the detection of breast cancer. Lastly, scintimammography is used in a subgroup of patients who have abnormal mammograms or whose screening is not reliable on the basis of using traditional mammography or ultrasound. The goal of early detection is to find the cancer when it is treatable. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, clinical breast exam, breast self-exam, thermography, tissue sampling and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

The internal and external sphincter muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex. Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia states that \"the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure\" and that \"the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand\". Research indicates that \n\n as a receptive partner solely from anal sex. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris (which has many nerve endings specifically intended for orgasm), and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation is less likely to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the majority of women. The vagina, for example, is flanked on each side by the clitoral crura, the internal legs of the clitoris, which are highly sensitive and become engorged \n\nOrgasm (from Greek , ; \"excitement, swelling\"; also sexual climax) is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Experienced by males and females, orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system. Human orgasms usually result from physical sexual stimulation of the penis in males (typically accompanying ejaculation) and of the clitoris in females. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner (penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or other sexual activity). The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the central nervous system such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., \"bordering\") areas of the brain. There is also a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, such as anorgasmia. These effects affect cultural views of orgasm, such as the beliefs that orgasm and the frequency or consistency of it are either important or irrelevant for satisfaction in a sexual relationship, and theories about the biological and evolutionary functions of orgasm. This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region. However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent. However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms. Achieving orgasm\nOrgasms can be achieved during a variety of activities, including vaginal, anal or oral sex, non-penetrative sex or masturbation. They may also be achieved by the use of a sex toy, such as a sensual vibrator or an erotic electrostimulation. In addition to physical stimulation, orgasm can be achieved from psychological arousal alone, such as during dreaming (nocturnal emission for males or females) or by forced orgasm. Scientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which \"appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm,\" but \"the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. Males\n\nVariabilities\nIn men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the penis. This is usually accompanied by ejaculation, but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a \"dry orgasm\"). They may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the prostate (see below). Masters and Johnson argued that, in the first stage, \"accessory organs contract and the male can feel the ejaculation coming; two to three seconds later the ejaculation occurs, which the man cannot constrain, delay, or in any way control\" and that, in the second stage, \"the male feels pleasurable contractions during ejaculation, reporting greater pleasure tied to a greater volume of ejaculate\". They reported that, unlike females, \"for the man the resolution phase includes a superimposed refractory period\" and added that \"many males below the age of 30, but relatively few thereafter, have the ability to ejaculate frequently and are subject to only very short refractory periods during the resolution phase\". There may not be an obvious refractory period, and the final orgasm may cause a refractory period. An increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. Females\n\nOrgasmic factors and variabilities\nIn women, the most common way to achieve orgasm is by direct sexual stimulation of the clitoris (meaning consistent manual, oral, or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris). The Mayo Clinic stated, \"Orgasms vary in intensity, and women vary in the frequency of their orgasms and the amount of stimulation necessary to trigger an orgasm.\" One misconception, particularly in older research publications, is that the vagina is completely insensitive. However, there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive. With regard to specific density of nerve endings, while the area commonly described as the G-spot may produce an orgasm, and the urethral sponge, an area in which the G-spot may be found, runs along the \"roof\" of the vagina and can create pleasurable sensations when stimulated, intense sexual pleasure (including orgasm) from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris. The greatest concentration of vaginal nerve endings are at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina. Sex educator Rebecca Chalker states that only one part of the clitoris, the urethral sponge, is in contact with the penis, fingers, or a dildo in the vagina. Hite and Chalker state that the tip of the clitoris and the inner lips, which are also very sensitive, are not receiving direct stimulation during penetrative intercourse. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful. Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first one, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. Clitoral and vaginal categories\nDiscussions of female orgasm are complicated by orgasms in women typically being divided into two categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm. In 1982, Ladas, Whipple and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation). This distinction began with Sigmund Freud, who postulated the concept of \"vaginal orgasm\" as separate from clitoral orgasm. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile-vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction. He \"criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women\" and \"viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response\" and the vagina as \"relatively unimportant\" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that \"few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated\". Some studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse, but O'Connell suggests that the clitoris's interconnected relationship with the vagina is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot. They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones, and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others. Buisson and Foldès suggested \"that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction\". Supporting a distinct G-spot is a study by Rutgers University, published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be – when several women stimulated themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine. Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledged a series of essays published in March 2012 in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women. Other factors and research\nRegular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, known as anorgasmia, is significantly more common in women than in men (see below). Scholars state \"many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse [vaginal sex]\" and that \"[e]ven the word foreplay suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'... ...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have faked an orgasm\". Sex counselor Ian Kerner stated, \"It's a myth that using the penis is the main way to pleasure a woman.\" He cites research concluding that women reach orgasm about 25% of the time with intercourse, compared with 81% of the time during oral sex (cunnilingus). In the first large-scale empirical study worldwide to link specific practices with orgasm, reported in the Journal of Sex Research in 2006, demographic and sexual history variables were comparatively weakly associated with orgasm. Practices included \"vaginal intercourse alone (12%), vaginal + manual stimulation of the man's and/or woman's genitals (49%), and vaginal intercourse + manual + oral (32%)\" and the \"[e]ncounters may also have included other practices. Men had an orgasm in 95% of encounters and women in 69%. Generally, the more practices engaged in, the higher a woman's chance of having an orgasm. Women were more likely to reach orgasm in encounters including cunnilingus\". Other studies suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal androgens are more likely to experience orgasm during vaginal intercourse than other women. Exercise-induced \nKinsey, in his 1953 book Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, stated that exercise could bring about sexual pleasure, including orgasm. A review in 1990 on the sexual response itself as exercise, reviewed the literature and stated that the field was poorly researched; it also said that studies had found that aerobic or isotonic exercise that resembles sexual activity or sexual positions can induce sexual pleasure, including orgasm. Starting in at least 2007, the term, \"coregasm\" was used in popular media to refer to exercise-induced orgasm or in academic parlance termed exercise-induced sexual pleasure or EISP, and an extensive discussion of the \"yogasm\" occurred in a 2011 Daily Beast posting. A paper published in 2012 presented results of an online survey of women who had experienced an orgasm or other sexual pleasure during exercise. The authors of the paper said that research on the relationship between exercise and sexual response was still lacking. Anal and prostate stimulation\n\nIn both sexes, pleasure can be derived from the nerve endings around the anus and the anus itself, such as during anal sex. The prostate is the male homologue (variation) to the Skene's glands (which are believed to be connected to the female G-spot), and can be sexually stimulated through anal sex, perineum massage or via a vibrator. It is typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex. The G-spot area, which is considered to be interconnected with the clitoris, may also be indirectly stimulated during anal sex. Although the anus has many nerve endings, their purpose is not specifically for inducing orgasm, and so a woman achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation is rare. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, while engaging in anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm during it. The aforementioned orgasms are sometimes referred to as anal orgasms, but sexologists and sex educators generally believe that orgasms derived from anal penetration are the result of the relationship between the nerves of the anus, rectum, clitoris or G-spot area in women, and the anus's proximity to the prostate and relationship between the anal and rectal nerves in men, rather than orgasms originating from the anus itself. Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. An orgasm is believed to occur in part because of the hormone oxytocin, which is produced in the body during sexual excitement and arousal and labor. It has also been shown that oxytocin is produced when a man or woman's nipples are stimulated and become erect. Komisaruk also relayed, however, that preliminary data suggests that nipple nerves may directly link up with the relevant parts of the brain without uterine mediation, acknowledging the men in his study who showed the same pattern of nipple stimulation activating genital brain regions. Medical aspects\n\nPhysiological responses\nMasters and Johnson were some of the first researchers to study the sexual response cycle in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They described a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness and the failure of communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled by the rest of the orgasmic cycle. Males\nAs a man nears orgasm during stimulation of the penis, he feels an intense and highly pleasurable pulsating sensation of neuromuscular euphoria. The sperm are transmitted up the vas deferens from the testicles, into the prostate gland as well as through the seminal vesicles to produce what is known as semen. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. The process takes from three to ten seconds, and produces a pleasurable feeling. It is believed that the exact feeling of \"orgasm\" varies from one man to another. Women's orgasms are preceded by erection of the clitoris and moistening of the opening of the vagina. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. Elsewhere in the body, myofibroblasts of the nipple-areolar complex contract, causing erection of the nipples and contraction of the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum at the start of orgasm. Researchers from the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands correlated the sensation of orgasm with muscular contractions occurring at a frequency of 8–13 Hz centered in the pelvis and measured in the anus. They found that using this metric they could distinguish from rest, voluntary muscular contractions, and even unsuccessful orgasm attempts. Women considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo \"pelvic massage\" — stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced \"hysterical paroxysm\" (i.e., orgasm). Brain\n\nThere have been very few studies correlating orgasm and brain activity in real time. One study examined 12 healthy women using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. Differences were reported in the brains of men and women during stimulation. Initial reports indicated that it was difficult to observe the effects of orgasm on men using PET scans, because the duration of the male orgasm was shorter. stated, \"Gender commonalities were most evident during orgasm... From these results, we conclude that during the sexual act, differential brain responses across genders are principally related to the stimulatory (plateau) phase and not to the orgasmic phase itself.\" Brain scans of both sexes have shown that the pleasure centers of a man's brain show more intense activity than in women during orgasm. Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain. A follow-up in 2001 which focused more specifically on cardiovascular health found that having sex three or more times a week was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of heart attack or stroke. A small percentage of men have a disease called postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS), which causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation. Dysfunction and satisfaction\n\nThe inability to have orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called anorgasmia or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, he is said to have sexual anhedonia (a condition in which an individual cannot feel pleasure from an orgasm) or ejaculatory anhedonia. Anorgasmia is significantly more common in women than in men, which has been attributed to the lack of sex education with regard to women's bodies, especially in sex-negative cultures, such as clitoral stimulation usually being key for women to orgasm. Approximately 25% of women report difficulties with orgasm, 10% of women have never had an orgasm, and 40% or 40–50% have either complained about sexual dissatisfaction or experienced difficulty becoming sexually aroused at some point in their lives. These rates were different in non-marital straight relationships (cohabitational, long-term and short-term heterosexual relationships), with rates increasing to 80.5% for men and 43.0% for women orgasming during sex with their short-term partners, and 69.3% for men and 82.6% for women thinking their short-term partners always orgasmed. However, in a 1996 study by Davis et al., 62% of women in a partnered relationship said they were satisfied with the frequency/consistency of their orgasms. Additionally, some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm. In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009), published in the Journal of Sex Research, found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts. If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be attributed to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications. Sexual dysfunction overall becomes more likely with poor physical and emotional health. Researchers have several hypotheses about the role, if any, of the female orgasm in the reproductive and therefore evolutionary process. The literature started with the argument that female orgasm is a byproduct of shared early male ontogeny, where male orgasm is an adaptation. Research has shifted to investigate and also support the sire-choice hypothesis, which proposes that female orgasm has been shaped by natural selection to function in the selection of high quality sires (male parents) for offspring. Therefore, orgasm increases the chances of conceiving with males of a high genetic quality. Selective pressure and mating\nWallen K and Lloyd EA stated, \"In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity.\" Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in Darwinian evolution by leading the female to select mates who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, and intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. Fertility\n\nThere are theories that the female orgasm might increase fertility. For example, it has been suggested that the 30% reduction in size of the vagina could help clench onto the penis (much like, or perhaps caused by, the pubococcygeus muscles), which would make it more stimulating for the male (thus ensuring faster or more voluminous ejaculation). The British biologists Baker and Bellis have suggested that the female orgasm may have a peristalsis or \"upsuck\" action (similar to the esophagus' ability to swallow when upside down), resulting in the retaining of favorable sperm and making conception more likely. The observation that women tend to reach orgasm more easily when they are ovulating also has led to the suggestion that it is tied to increasing fertility. They quote primate sexuality specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm \"seems far-fetched\" because \"females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale [promiscuous] mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units.\" Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, he appears to have doubts, when he writes, \"One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition.\" A 2005 twin study found that one in three women reported never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed. This variation in ability to orgasm, generally thought to be psychosocial, was found to be 34% to 45% genetic. She argues that the bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm. By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is why it has been \"historically ignored\", mainly because of \"a fear of pleasure. suggest that women's vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length. Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip. However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus. An empirical study carried out in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between inability to have a vaginal orgasm and psychosexual immaturity. In the study, women reported their past month frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various psychopathologies. Moreover, \"vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores comparable to those of established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups.\" The incidence of those who experience unsolicited sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due to shame or embarrassment of the victim. Such orgasms may happen to either gender. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Literature\n\nOrgasm has been widely described in literature over the centuries. The theme of orgasm survived during Romanticism and is incorporated in many homoerotic works. In the novel Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928), by D. H. Lawrence, we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: \"As he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her...\"\n\nOther animals\n\nThe mechanics of male orgasm are similar in most male mammals. Females of some mammal and some non-mammal species, such as alligators, have clitorises. The duration of orgasm varies considerably among different mammal species.

People may experience pleasure from anal sex by stimulation of the anal nerve endings, and orgasm may be achieved through anal penetration – by indirect stimulation of the prostate in men, indirect stimulation of the clitoris or an area of the vagina (sometimes called the G-spot) in women, and other sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve). However, people may also find anal sex painful, sometimes extremely so, which may be due to \n\n the anterior wall of the vagina; it and other areas of the vagina are considered to have tissue and nerves that are related to the clitoris. Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, while engaging in anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm during it. Stimulation from anal sex can additionally be affected by popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as erotica or pornography.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms\nGonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women\nHalf of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants\n\nIf not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread\nThe infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis\n\nTraditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention \n\nAs with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow. Treatment\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on early detection (i.e., screening of high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, PCR testing should be considered) and appropriate treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea is important. Sexual partners\nIt is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in five years. In 2016, the WHO published new guidelines for treatment, stating \"There is an urgent need to update treatment recommendations for gonococcal infections to respond to changing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of N. gonorrhoeae. High-level resistance to previously recommended quinolones is widespread and decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, another recommended first-line treatment in the 2003 guidelines, is increasing and several countries have reported treatment failures.\" Prognosis\n\nGonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or petechia, septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. In men, inflammation of the epididymis, prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea. In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. Epidemiology\n\nAbout 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. In the US, it is the second-most-common bacterial sexually transmitted infections; chlamydia remains first. According to the CDC African Americans are most affected by gonorrhea, accounting for 69% of all gonorrhea cases in 2010. The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment. In 1854, Dr. Wilhelm Gollmann addressed gonorrhea in his book, Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs. The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Research \nA vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice. As N. gonorrhoeae is closely related to N. meningitidis and they have 80–90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines is plausible. Men can be infected with syphilis and have very mild symptoms or none at all. [6] Also called the \"clap\" or \"drip,\" gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. The infection spreads most often among people who have many sex partners. [7] During the \n\nGonorrhea, colloquially known as the clap, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms\nGonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women\nHalf of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants\n\nIf not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread\nThe infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis\n\nTraditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. For this reason, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing are often combined. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention \n\nAs with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow. Treatment\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes.

Lack of development in the Superego, or an incoherently developed Superego within an individual, will result in thoughts and actions that are irrational and abnormal, contrary to the norms and beliefs of society. The personality structure theory of psychoanalysis includes three interconnected elements: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id can be considered as the primitive and instinctual part of our personality. It mediates between the demands of the id and the constraints of the superego. It develops through the internalization of societal rules and parental teachings. Psychoanalytic theory suggests that an imbalance or disruption in these elements can lead to personality disturbances or psychological disorders. Id, Ego, and Superego Id – The irrational, instinctual, unknown and unconscious part of the psyche. Superego – It acts as an internal censor, causing us to make moral judgments in the \n\n In his structural theory, Sigmund Freud described the ego as the mediator between the id and super-ego and the external world. The task of the ego is to find a balance between primitive drives, morals, and reality, while simultaneously satisfying the id and superego. Freudians saw the ego as forming from separate \"nuclei\": 'A final ego is formed by synthetic integration of these nuclei, and in certain states of ego regression a split of the ego into its original nuclei becomes observable'. Ego defenses are often employed by the \n\nThe proponent of the concept of the id, ego, and superego in psychology is Sigmund Freud. The id represents our basic, instinctual drives and operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification of desires. It operates on an unconscious level and is constantly seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. It seeks to satisfy the id's desires in a rational and socially acceptable manner. Freud's concept of the id, ego, and superego provides a framework for understanding the conflicting forces that shape human behavior and contribute to psychological development.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

It was first proposed by the sociologist Lee Ellis in 2005 in his paper \"A Theory Explaining Biological Correlates of Criminality\" published in the European Journal of Criminology. Since then, it has expanded into an interdisciplinary field that intersects biology, psychology, and sociology. The first is that in human mating behavior, females prefer males that appear to be more competent providers of resources, and so males exhibit increased competitive behavior than females to obtain access to those resources. The second is that biological mechanisms (namely increased presence of androgens) lead to differential development in the male brain which then mediates the increased competitive behaviors that cause criminality. Though it was originally intended to explain high rates of criminality in young men, it has since been used as a framework to explain gang behavior, terrorism, and the rise of the criminal justice system.

Harnois and Bastos (2018) show an association between women's perceptions of workplace sexual harassment and self-reported physical health. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. For example, in 1995, Judith Coflin committed suicide after chronic sexual harassment by her bosses and coworkers. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying. There is some evidence linking experiences of sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence with patterns of victimization during adulthood. For instance, a case control study in Australia on the long-term impact of abuse reported significant associations between child sexual abuse and experiencing rape, sexual and mental health problems, domestic violence and other problems in intimate relationships even after accounting for various family background characteristics. Those who had experienced abuse involving intercourse had more negative outcomes than those suffering other types of coercion.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

The abuse of cocaine has been linked to various complications during pregnancy, including placental abruption, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Children exposed to cocaine in utero may experience cognitive and developmental issues. Studies have shown that cocaine-exposed children may have lower verbal-reasoning scores and smaller head circumference compared to non-exposed children. Growing up in an environment where cocaine abuse is present can also increase the risk of substance abuse and addiction later in life. It is important to note that these consequences are not limited to cocaine use alone. Substance abuse, including abuse of other substances and comorbid psychiatric illness, often co-occur with cocaine abuse. This can further exacerbate the risks and complications associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. Overall, the potential risks and consequences of cocaine abuse during pregnancy and for children exposed to cocaine in utero are serious. The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated that 5 million or more women have used nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs during pregnancy. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 5.5% of women used an illicit drug, 18.8% used alcohol and 20.4% smoked cigarettes during pregnancy. Evidence from clinical reports and case studies suggests that a pregnant woman and her developing fetus are at risk for a wide range of potential problems when cocaine is present. Among the medical complications attributed to cocaine use in a pregnant woman are cardiovascular effects including acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, rupture of the ascending aorta, central nervous system complications including aneurysms due to increases in blood pressure, and other, less frequently occurring effects such as respiratory arrest and seizures. The medical complications that may result from the life-style associated with drug use include failure to seek proper prenatal care, nutritional deficits, and weight loss. Cocaine also crosses the placental barrier and can result in detrimental effects to the fetus. Unfortunately, studies have also shown associations between cocaine use during pregnancy and the occurrence of fetal anomalies, including an increase in skull malformations, limb defects, urethral obstruction, enlarged bladder, cystic distension of the kidneys, and neural defects. In addition to effects on physical development, neurological and behavioral abnormalities observed in cocaine-exposed infants have included tremulousness, muscle rigidity, and poor performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS). Cocaine exposure has also been associated with brain stem auditory defects, perinatal cerebral infarction, and vision problems. Cocaine-exposed infants are largely unable to respond to the human voice and face, and are unable to interact with others. Most children who were exposed to cocaine before birth have normal intelligence. However, studies of cocaine-exposed school-aged children do suggest subtle effects on intelligence and behavior. Cocaine has also been shown to have teratogenic effects on fetal development. Cocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. The vasoconstriction of the effects of cocaine lead to a decrease in placental blood flow to the fetus that results in fetal hypoxia that is oxygen deficiency and decreased fetal nutrition these vasoconstrictive effects on the placenta have been linked to the number of complications in malformations that are evident in the newborn.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

For example, gay men with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style (an individual made uncomfortable by \"close emotional relationships, but will desperately try to seek out reassurance from another person\") might be more reluctant to use condoms during sexual intercourse because they believe this will make them feel more wanted by their partner. Meanwhile a gay man with an anxious-avoidant attachment style (an individual who does not like to get close to others) will most likely try to remain disconnected from his partner for fear of becoming too close or intimate. According to the differential diagnosis guidelines provided in the text of the DSM-IV the two conditions are distinguished by the extent to which the individual desires social contact versus being indifferent to it. In the case of the avoidant and schizoid PDs, however, both the problem and its solution may be more academic than real. First, research indicates that all of the avoidant symptoms except social withdrawal correlate negatively with the schizoid symptom list and that differential diagnosis is not difficult. The relationship between schizoid personality disorder (SPD) and avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) has been a subject of controversy for decades. Through the efforts of Theodore Millon, this complex idea was later divided across two disorders with the emergence of a separate AvPD \n\n feelings in regards to their relationships. The psychologist professor Dr. Geraldine Downey found that women were more likely to experience rejection sensitivity in comparison to the negativity held by men about the future of their relationships. \"RS was a stronger predictor of concern about rejection during conflict, and of feeling lonely and unloved after conflict, in women than in men\" The original hypothesis aligned with the findings that \"HRS women may be more likely to behave in ways that exacerbate conflicts.\" Other specific examples discussed in psychology include:\n\nsecure attachment — confidence in the availability of caregiver during times of need. ; disorganized/disoriented attachment — mixed, contradictory behaviors towards caregiver, often including displays of fear.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

One of the main factors is the belief that sexual activity should be restricted to certain situations or within specific boundaries in order to maintain moral and spiritual purity. Religions often view sexuality as a powerful force that needs to be channeled in a way that promotes harmony, fidelity, and family stability. Many religions view sexual activity primarily as a means of reproduction and therefore place a strong emphasis on responsible and purposeful sexual behavior within the context of marriage. These norms are often influenced by historical, geographical, and cultural factors, which can vary widely among different religious traditions. It is important to note that while many religions emphasize sexual morality, the specific teachings and practices regarding sexual behavior can differ greatly among different religious traditions. Overall, the emphasis on sexual behavior in world religions is influenced by a combination of moral, procreative, social, and cultural factors, all of which contribute to the formation of religious teachings and practices regarding sexuality. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse.\" Religions have had differing views about love and sexual relations between people of the same sex. A large proportion of the Abrahamic sects view sexual relationships outside of a heterosexual marriage, including sex between same-sex partners, negatively, though there are groups within each faith that disagree with orthodox positions and challenge their doctrinal authority. Support of homosexual behavior is reflected in the acceptance of sexually heterodox individuals in all functions of the church, and the sanctification \n\n sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female virginity because it is non-procreative and does not tear the hymen; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss. Heterosexuals may view anal sex as \"fooling around\" or as foreplay; scholar Laura M. Carpenter stated that this view \"dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'\" He views sexuality as a meaningful aspect of human behavior, giving it significance beyond being a mere biological or physiological urge.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

Freud's clinical and theoretical work led him to posit that children from the time of birth are polymorphously perverse, or capable of experiencing pleasure from the stimulation of any part of the body. As physical and psychological development progresses, specific parts of the body become the focal points of pleasure. These psychosexual stages are oral, anal, phallic, then a period of latency, and finally the genital stage. As the child develops, say from age two to three, the erogenous zone becomes the anus, with the socially acceptable expression of pleasure being bowel control. In the phallic stage of psychosexual development, pleasure is gained from the child's own genitals.The immediate, always imperfect, resolution of the conflict comes when the child identifies with the same-sex parent.The child then enters the latency period, where there is little psychosexual development. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual \n\n the stage in child development (between ages of three and six). Oedipus complex for male child-affection toward his mom; and Electra complex (according to Jung) as female child’s affection toward her father. Of course, we have to understand that the latent content is not limited to repressed sexual desires. By directly applying the techniques employed in Freudian dream analysis, the psychoanalytic critic believes \n\n it between another individual's thighs. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

In addition, different parts of the brain play important roles in the perception of romantic love. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when a person who is madly in love is dumped by the partner.12 Therefore, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach in humans rather than as a purely emotional endeavor. Several psychologists have attempted to define romantic love from a different standpoint. In general, romantic love has three components: attachment, caregiving, and sex.13 Sternberg postulated a triangular theory of love. According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. In the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).In the last step, a decision may be made by both partners to continue the romantic relation, or it may be a commitment in which both partners are committed to each other and to continuing the love for a long time.14\n\nLarge Brain and Monogamy\n\nOne of the biological bases of human monogamy may be related to the large brain size of humans compared to the body. Social psychological approaches to explaining love have been developed to help further explain the psychological components involved in love. One of the more prominent concepts pertaining to love was proposed by Robert J. Sternberg known as the \"Triangular theory of love\". The three sides are Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment. For example, Intimacy plus Passion leads to romantic love while Intimacy plus Commitment leads to compassionate love. Triangular theories do not solely apply to one's own current relationship, they also can be meant for explaining what different levels of intimacy/passion/commitment mean in an imbalanced triangle, or even determine your love triangle for a preference of relationship. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy. Different parts of the brain also play important roles in the perception of romantic love. From a psychological standpoint, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach rather than just an emotional experience. One popular theory is Sternberg's triangular theory of love, which suggests that love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. Initially, partners may be attracted to each other based on sex appeal, which can then lead to the development of intimacy and bonding in a loving relationship. It is associated with components such as intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment, which contribute to the overall experience of romantic love.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

While these movements hold in common that abortion (when there is no threat to the life of the mother) is a form of infanticide, there is no consensus as to whether exceptions should be allowed when the mother's life is in mortal danger, or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The church has clearly defined views on abortion: \"In today's society, abortion has become a common practice, defended by deceptive arguments. Latter-day prophets have denounced abortion, referring to the Lord's declaration, 'Thou shalt not ... kill, nor do anything like unto it' (Doctrine & Covenants Section 59, Verse 6). Their counsel on the matter is clear: Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints must not submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for an abortion. But even these circumstances do not automatically justify an abortion. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder. Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure. Several historians have written that prior to the 19th century most Catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before \"quickening\" or \"ensoulment\" as an \n\n Most of Orthodox Judaism opposes most abortion, with some authorities considering it a form of murder.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.
