First, the authority of the sovereign by whose command the war is to be waged... Secondly, a just cause is required, namely that those who are attacked, should be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault... Thirdly, it is necessary that the belligerents should have a rightful intention, so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil...\" - Summa, II-II, Q.40, art.1. On the other hand, Just War Theory explores the moral dimensions of warfare, and to better limit the destructive reality caused by war, seeks to establish a doctrine of military ethics. [...] Men who take up arms against one another in public war do not cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to one another and to God. Military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge, nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions. It admits of deception, but disclaims acts of perfidy; and, in general, military necessity does not include any act of hostility which makes the return to peace unnecessarily difficult.\" As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (jus ad bellum) is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the laws of armed conflict \"[presuppose] extraterritoriality\". Military necessity, along with distinction, proportionality, humanity (sometimes called unnecessary suffering), and honor  (sometimes called chivalry) are the five most commonly cited principles of international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

Although many states censor communications to different extents, they all share one commonality in that a body must decide what information to censor and what information to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be considered offensive or \n\n Adam Smith was not the only classical liberal political economist concerned with class conflict. In his Considerations on Representative Government, John Stuart Mill observed the complete marginalisation of workmen's voices in Parliament, rhetorically asking whether its members ever empathise with the position of workmen, instead of siding entirely with their masters, on issues such as the right to go on strike. Later in the book, he argues that an important function of truly representative government is to provide a relatively equal balance of power between workmen and masters, in order to prevent threats to the good of the whole of society. During Mill's discussion of the merits of progressive taxation in his essay Utilitarianism, he notes as an aside the power of the rich as independent of state support:\"People feel obliged to argue that the State does more for the rich than for the poor, as a justification for its taking more [in taxation] from them: though this is in reality not true, for the rich would be far better able to protect themselves, in the absence of law or government, than the poor, and indeed would probably be successful in converting the poor into their slaves.\" \"[T]he best books of any one age have always been written from several different viewpoints, some of them palpably more false than others. In so far as a writer is a propagandist, the most one can ask of him is that he shall genuinely believe in what he is saying, and that it shall not be something blazingly silly. To-day, for example, one can imagine a good book being written by a Catholic, a Communist, a Fascist, pacifist, an anarchist, perhaps by an old-style Liberal or an ordinary Conservative: one cannot imagine a good book being written by a spiritualist, \n\n France.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

For example, on this account, an experience of intense pleasure of indulging in food and sex is worth more than an experience of subtle pleasure of looking at fine art or of engaging in a stimulating intellectual conversation. Instead, they argue that the quality is another factor relevant to the value of a pleasure-experience, for example, that the lower pleasures of the body are less valuable than the \n\n the utilitarian end, the end or object of utility, of society or of justice, and so forth. Quantities of pain or pleasure may be regarded as magnitudes having the same definiteness as tons of pig iron, barrels of sugar, bushels of wheat, yards of cotton, or pounds of wool; and as political economy seeks to ascertain the conditions under which these commodities may be produced with the greatest efficiency--so the economy of happiness seeks to ascertain the conditions under which happiness, regarded as a commodity, may be produced with the greatest efficiency--how the maximum output of happiness may be achieved with the means available. Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure. For Immanuel Kant (Critique of Judgment, 1790), \"enjoyment\" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be \"beautiful\" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging reflective contemplation. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure—higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure. Mill also argues that simpler beings (he often refers to pigs) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures; since they do not see other aspects of life, they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

Reproductive Cloning: SCNT has been used to create cloned animals, such as Dolly the sheep. Disease Research: SCNT is used to create animal models of human diseases. By introducing specific genetic mutations into animal embryos through SCNT, scientists can study the development and progression of various diseases, which can help in understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing potential treatments. Regenerative Medicine: SCNT can be used to create embryos that are genetically matched to a patient. This holds great potential for treating various conditions, such as degenerative diseases or tissue damage. Preservation of Endangered Species: SCNT offers a potential method for preserving endangered species. By using somatic cells from preserved tissue samples, it may be possible to create embryos and eventually offspring of endangered species, thereby contributing to conservation efforts. It's important to note that while SCNT has various applications, it is also a highly complex and controversial technique. SCNT is a laboratory technique for creating an ovum with donor nucleus. It can be used in embryonic stem cell research, regenerative medicine i.e. “therapeutic cloning.” It can also be used as first step in process of reproductive cloning. Mouse, Monkey and Human embryonic stem cells can be created using SCNT. This technique was used to create first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep. SCNT can be used to generate exact copies of cells to be used for tissue and organs for a patient in need. If SCNT were to be mastered by humans, it could assist in treating diseases associated with mitochondrial dna. There is a high fetal death rate when SCNT is used on an embryo in any organism. Scientists are making progress in their efforts to bring the gastric-brooding frog species back to life using somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), a method of cloning. There are different methods used for cloning, including somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and artificial embryo splitting. In somatic cell nuclear transfer, the nucleus of a somatic cell is extracted and inserted into an enucleated egg from the same species. This method was first demonstrated by embryologist Hans Spemann in 1901 when he split a salamander embryo. Successful animal cloning experiments include the work of Hans Spemann in 1901, where a salamander embryo was split into two parts and developed into two complete organisms. Examples include the cloning of salamanders, frogs, and the famous case of Dolly the sheep. **Figure 1.10** Diagrammatic illustration of Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT).Numerous research studies are currently underway to provide clonal populations of embryonic stem cells for either therapeutic or drug discovery initiatives.It should be noted that in 1998 John Gearhart and his research team at Johns Hopkins published the first report on the derivation of pluripotent stem cells from germ cells of the human embryo (Shamblott et al., 1998). In order to grasp the impact cloning has had on stem cell research it is important to understand the basic mechanistic procedure behind cloning. S **omatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)** is defined as a technique for creating a clonal embryo by combining an ovum (egg) with a donor nucleus. In SCNT a donor nucleus is removed from a cell for which cloning is desired and inserted microsurgically into an enucleated (nucleus has been removed) egg. The \"clonal\" resulting cell may be either propagated in tissue culture or allowed to develop into an embryo and transplanted into a surrogate mother, a process known as **reproductive cloning** (Figure 1.10). **Therapeutic cloning** can be defined as reproduction of a genetically identical cell for purposes of cell therapy such as cellular replacement. **Figure 1.10** Diagrammatic illustration of Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). See text for a detailed description.Researchers at the Rosland Institute in Scotland, led by Sir Ian Wilmut, an English embryologist who is currently Director of the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, successfully cloned the first mammal from an adult somatic cell in 1996.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

Instead, Posner claims that \"[expanding and invigorating] the laws that protect animals will require not philosophical arguments for reducing human beings to the level of the other animals but facts, facts that will stimulate a greater empathetic response to animal suffering and facts that will alleviate concern about the human costs of further measures to reduce animal suffering.\" In the review, Posner argues that Wise's approach, using the cognitive ability of animals compared to that of very young normal human beings as a basis for rights-worthiness, is arbitrary and in contrast with major traditional and contemporary philosophies (including the theology of Thomas Aquinas for one and utilitarianism for another).

By collaborating and working together, different sectors such as healthcare, environment, and government can pool their resources, knowledge, and expertise to address the challenges posed by climate change on public health. These partnerships enable the sharing of data, information, and best practices, which helps in developing effective strategies and interventions to mitigate the health risks associated with climate change. For example, using environmental information to develop early warning systems can help communities prepare for extreme weather events or disease outbreaks that may be influenced by climate change. By combining resources and aligning strategies, governments, healthcare providers, community organizations, and other stakeholders can work together to implement climate-resilient infrastructure and policies, promote sustainable practices, and enhance healthcare services for vulnerable populations. Moreover, partnerships across sectors can also address the issue of health inequities exacerbated by climate change. This approach ensures that no one is left behind and that efforts are made to reduce the current vulnerabilities while simultaneously preparing for the long-term impacts of climate change. By collaborating, sharing knowledge, and addressing health inequities, these partnerships can strengthen current interventions, improve healthcare services, and implement preventive measures to protect the most vulnerable populations from the health risks associated with climate change.

Fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century. Emissions scenarios can be combined with modelling of the carbon cycle to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic emissions. Future warming depends on the strengths of climate feedbacks and on emissions of greenhouse gases. The former are often estimated using climate models, developed by multiple scientific institutions. Models project different future temperature rises for given emissions of greenhouse gases; they do not fully agree on the strength of different feedbacks on climate sensitivity and magnitude of inertia of the \n\n the most important as approximately three-quarters of the human-generated global warming effect may attributed to increased carbon dioxide output.

Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles. It can be considered as a version of utilitarianism that gives greater priority to reducing suffering (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing pleasure (positive utility).

Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences. Threshold deontology holds that rules ought to govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the consequences become so dire that they cross a stipulated threshold, consequentialism takes over. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit virtues, building character strengths, and forming mental associations. In general, proponents of teleological ethics argue that the moral value of any act consists in its tendency to produce things of intrinsic value, meaning that an act is right if and only if it, or the rule under which it falls, produces, will probably produce, or is intended to produce, a greater balance of good over evil than any alternative act. The two major families of views in teleological ethics are virtue ethics and consequentialism. Teleological ethical theories are often discussed in opposition to deontological ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are inherently good or bad, rather than good or bad because of extrinsic factors (such as the act's consequences or the moral character of the person who acts). The paradigm consequentialist family of theories is utilitarianism, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends on whether that act maximizes some sort of net good. This theory's main developments came from Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. ; 2) Deontological ethics, notions based on\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral disputes.

Boon argues in the book that for everything in the universe there already is a copy, as much as everything is original. Therefore, it is impossible under ethics to ban the copy, since it is impossible not to copy.

For instance, cloning of an entire ear appears to be a reasonable expectation in the near future. Despite the limitless potential that such interventions promise, the huge ethical issues associated with the cloning of individuals has largely overshadowed such promise in the eyes of the public. Deep concerns exist over the moral and ethical questions of cloning people—and even other animals. One of the most misunderstood concepts of the cloning of individuals is the idea of making an exact duplicate of one's self. It is critical to recognize that our genetic code is not the sole determinant of who we are as individuals.One only has to think about the practical example of monozygotic (MZ) twins.Almost everyone has had the chance to know a set of siblings who are monozygous twins.Simple observation will quickly highlight the fact that those two persons, while similar, are not exactly the same.Simply put, although they are genetically identical they are not developmentally identical. Many philosophers appeal to what is colloquially known as the yuck factor, or the belief that a widespread common negative intuition towards something is evidence that there is something morally wrong about it. Kass attempts to make a case against human cloning on the basis of the widespread strong feelings of repugnance at cloning.

He lists examples of the various unpalatable consequences of cloning and appeals to notions of human nature and dignity to show that our disgust is the emotional expression of deep wisdom that is not fully articulable. The term \"wisdom of repugnance\" was coined in 1997 by Leon Kass, chairman (2001–2005) of the President's Council on Bioethics, in an article in The New Republic, which was later expanded into a further (2001) article in the same magazine, and also incorporated into his 2002 book Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity. Kass stated that disgust was not an argument per se, but went on to say that \"in crucial cases... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate.\" The concept is also used in the study of controversies such as same-sex marriage, pornography, marijuana legalization, alternative sexualities and legalization of abortion.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court \n\nJoseph Ratzinger's bioethical arguments revolve around three key elements that address the questions surrounding the origin and identity of human life, as well as the ethical treatment of the \"other.\" This illuminates and clarifies the answers to the real questions raised in bioethical actions. By affirming the inherent dignity of human life, Ratzinger provides a strong foundation for ethical considerations in bioethics. Lastly, Ratzinger's bioethical arguments touch upon the ethical treatment of the \"other,\" including embryos. He argues that due to their lofty dignity, all individuals, including embryos, deserve protection and respect. His arguments call for legal frameworks that safeguard the rights and well-being of all human beings. In summary, Joseph Ratzinger's bioethical arguments incorporate a theological dimension into the dialogue, addressing the origin and identity of human life. By highlighting the divine aspect of human origin and emphasizing the inherent dignity of every individual, including embryos, Ratzinger's arguments provide a framework for ethically addressing bioethical questions and promote the protection and respect of all human life.
