The model postulates six steps a buyer moves through when making a purchase: ; Awareness ; Knowledge ; Liking ; Preference ; Conviction ; Purchase ; Means-end theory suggests that an advertisement should contain a message or means that leads the consumer to a desired end-state. Various competing models of hierarchies of effects attempt to provide a theoretical underpinning to advertising practice. In 1983, Petty, Cacioppo and Schumann conducted a study to examine source effects in advertising. It was a product advertisement about a new disposable razor. The authors purposefully made one group of subjects highly involved with the product, by telling them the product would be test marketed soon in the local area and by the end of the experiment they would be given a chance to get a disposable razor. It is widely acknowledged that effects of ads are not only limited to the information contained in the ad alone but are also a function of the different appeals used in the ads (like use celebrities or non-celebrities as endorsers).

Complete Feedback is one of Charles Hockett's 16 Design features of language which states that speakers are able to hear what they are saying. Feedback can be both positive and negative. Positive feedback reinforces the current behavior or output, while negative feedback works to regulate and correct deviations from the desired behavior. It consists of methods like Feedback from employees, helps in bringing Mutual Trust and helps the organization to determine, implement or decide upon new policies. It suffers from problems like information can be changed during transmission, unwillingness to participate, fear of inefficiency, bypassing and flattery too. It is a time taking process and is comparatively slow too. In the process of communication and control systems, feedback plays a crucial role. Feedback can be either positive or negative in nature. Positive feedback amplifies the initial input, whereas negative feedback counteracts or reduces the input. This feedback loop allows for adjustments and corrections to be made based on the received information. In the context of control systems, feedback is essential for ensuring accurate and efficient functioning. For example, in motor behavior, various brain centers rely on feedback from receptors to control movements. Overall, feedback in communication and control systems is vital for maintaining accuracy, efficiency, and regulation. It allows for adjustments and corrections to be made based on the information received, ensuring the desired outcomes are achieved.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

The rapid expansion of consumer goods during post World War II only increased existing goods in the market through amassed innovation, creating another major shifts in branding, which is more focused on superior features, unique ingredients and functional benefits. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. \"Instead of operating on the premise that price, determined by marketplace supply and demand, functioned as an information feedback system telling manufacturers how much to produce, the new breed of marketers maintained that markets could be created by.\" New target markets were formed since the revolution did not just trigger a shift in the marketing industry, but it also instigated a powerful impact on social classes. Cano, for example, has argued that marketing practitioners followed competitor-based approaches to both market segmentation and product positioning in the first decades of the twentieth century; long before these concepts were introduced into the marketing literature in the 1950s and 60s. From around 1920, American agency, J. Walter Thompson (JWT), began to focus on developing brand personality, brand image, and brand identity—concepts that are very closely related to positioning. Across the Atlantic, the English agency, W. S. Crawford's Ltd, began to use the concept of 'product personality' and the 'advertising idea' arguing that\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

The presence of excess demand in one market influences effective demand or supply in another market, which may influence the degree of disequilibrium in the latter market; in turn, the constraints imposed on participants in that market influence their effective demand or supply in the former market. In economics, effective demand (ED) in a market is the demand for a product or service which occurs when purchasers are constrained in a different market. The value of the service disappears after consumption by the end-user. 1) Context in which the service will operate, e.g., in a ‘shopping mall’, or at the ‘office’. ; 3) Added value in comparison of existing services, ‘easier to use’, or ‘gives more information’. ; 4) Estimation of its use, e.g., ‘how often will consumers use it?’, and ‘what does it mean to the user?’.

In addition, in a time of labor shortage, they are constrained in how much labor they can employ; therefore the amount of goods they choose to supply at any \n\n would be distributed over a greater revenue base, thus improving cost efficiency.

In most cases, the ceiling price is close to the innovator's price, indicating the methodology — based on average MRPs of the brands — is faulty, industry experts say. Leena Menghaney, treatment activist and lawyer, said, \"The system devised by NPPA of fixing prices encourages companies to artificially keep prices high, and hence, works against patients and consumer interests, leaving essential medicines out of reach for most. The government has allowed both multinational and generic countries to profiteer out of the disease of people, driving millions of patients to death.\" In certain cases, there are limitations in making drugs affordable,\" an NPPA official said. More importantly, companies offer further discounts for bulk orders through tenders which makes them cheaper than the ceiling price as well,\" Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD, Biocon, said. \"Companies have benefited from subsidized land, infrastructure and other tax incentives given by government, for research and development. However, there is a section which feels that price control alone cannot improve access. \"Competitive pricing, local production and compulsory licensing will drive down prices\", says Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general D G Shah. United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960), was a 1960 decision of the United States Supreme Court limiting the so-called Colgate doctrine, which substantially insulates unilateral refusals to deal with price-cutters from the antitrust laws. The Parke, Davis & Co. case held that, when a company goes beyond \"the limited dispensation\" of Colgate by taking affirmative steps to induce adherence to its suggested prices, it puts together a combination among competitors to fix prices in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. In addition, the Court held that when a company abandons an illegal practice because it knows the US Government is investigating it and contemplating suit, it is an abuse of discretion for the trial court to hold the case that follows moot and dismiss it without granting relief sought against the illegal practice. In United States antitrust law, monopolization is illegal monopoly behavior. The main categories of prohibited behavior include exclusive dealing, price discrimination, refusing to supply an essential facility, product tying and predatory pricing. Monopolization is a federal crime under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. Generally this means that corporations may not act in ways that have been identified as contrary to precedent cases. In FTC v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., the company adopted a policy of refusing to sell to price cutters. When an offender was cut off, he would be reinstated upon the giving of assurances that he would maintain prices in the future.\" The company sought to defend under Colgate, but the Court said that \"the Beech-Nut system goes for beyond the simple refusal to sell goods to persons who will not sell at stated prices, which, in the Colgate case, was held to be within the legal right of the producer.\" It \n\n The Robinson–Patman Act of 1936 (or Anti-Price Discrimination Act, Pub. 1526 (codified at )) is a United States federal law that prohibits anticompetitive practices by producers, specifically price discrimination. Co-sponsored by Senator Joseph T. Robinson (Democrat of Arkansas) and Representative Wright Patman (Democrat of Texas), it was designed to protect small retail shops against competition from chain stores by fixing a minimum price for retail products. Specifically, the law prevents suppliers, wholesalers, or manufacturers from supplying goods to “preferred customers“ at a reduced price. It also prevents coercing suppliers into restrictions as to who they can and can't sell goods The law grew out of practices in which chain stores were allowed to purchase goods at lower prices than other retailers. The amendment to the Clayton Antitrust Act prevented unfair price discrimination for the first time by requiring a seller to offer the same price terms to customers at a given level of trade. The Act provided for criminal penalties but contained a specific exemption for \"cooperative associations\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

Jerome McCarthy in the 1960s. Place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. There are two theories based on four Cs: Lauterborn's four Cs (consumer, cost, communication, convenience) and Shimizu's four Cs (commodity, cost, communication, channel) in the 7Cs Compass Model (Co-marketing). Communications can include advertising, sales promotion, public relations, publicity, personal selling, corporate identity, internal communication, SNS, and MIS. Distribution (or place) is one of the four elements of the marketing mix. Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user who needs it. The other three elements of the marketing mix are product, pricing, and promotion. Decisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company's overall strategic vision and mission. Product mix, also known as product assortment, is the total number of variety of products that a firm sells to their customers. Each approaches' results vary based on many factors including location, market, trends, etc., therefore business should carefully consider their product mix. A diversified product mix can target the maximum number of customers, however, such numbers of product lines requires much attention and focus as each product line targets different groups of consumers and involves individual strategy and management. The original marketing mix, or 4 Ps, as originally proposed by marketer and academic Philip Kotler & E. Jerome McCarthy, provides a framework for marketing decision-making. McCarthy's marketing mix has since become one of the most enduring and widely accepted frameworks in marketing.

In order for a social role to be considered a suitable candidate for the mental health gatekeeper function, there are five criteria that are considered important or essential. These criteria serve as a shortcut prior to investing time and resources into implementing the role. The first criterion is \"accessibility.\" A suitable candidate for the mental health gatekeeper function should have regular contact with individuals who may be in need of mental health services. The second criterion is \"approachability.\" The fourth criterion is \"cultural competence.\" In this example, the outcome of the 'Verify Account' decision directed the responses of the new account process. The same is true for the 'Classify Customer' decision. By adding or changing the business rules in the tables, one can easily change the criteria for these decisions and control the process differently. Modeling is a critical aspect of improving an existing process or business challenge. Modeling is generally done by a team of business analysts, IT personnel, and modeling experts. Now with the addition of DMN, business analysts can construct an understandable model of complex decisions. Rather than giving general instructions on smaller tasks and then devoting time to supervising larger concerns, the micromanager monitors and assesses every step of a business process and avoids delegation of decisions. Micromanagement also frequently involves requests for unnecessary and overly detailed reports (\"reportomania\"). This focus on \"low-level\" trivia often delays decisions, clouds overall goals and objectives, restricts the flow of information between employees,\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

Various competing theories have been proposed \n\nReinforcers depend on an organism's motivational state and the affordances in its surrounding environment. Just as the colors white and black are perceived based on the interaction of an organism's visual system and the reflectances in its surroundings, reinforcers are determined by the organism's motivational state and the possibilities for perception and action in its environment. In order for these potentialities to be realized, motivational operations and stimulus contexts are required to alter the organism's state or disposition to make the desired response. This means that an organism's internal drives, emotions, and dispositions play a significant role in determining what is reinforcing in a particular context. action, with the intention that the action will now occur more frequently.

In dividing or segmenting markets, researchers typically look for common characteristics such as shared needs, common interests, similar lifestyles, or even similar demographic profiles. The overall aim of segmentation is to identify high yield segments – that is, those segments that are likely to be the most profitable or that have growth potential – so that these can be selected for special attention (i.e. Geoff Tennant, a Six Sigma consultant from the United Kingdom, uses the following analogy to explain the difference: A supermarket's customer is the person buying milk at that supermarket; a not-customer buys milk from a competing supermarket, whereas a non-customer doesn't buy milk from supermarkets at all but rather \"has milk delivered to the door in the traditional British way\". While marketers, market regulation, and economists use the intermediate/ultimate categorization, the field of customer service more often categorizes customers into two classes: Before the introduction of the notion of an internal \n\nSegmentation: refers to the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers (known as segments) Targeting: refers to the selection of a segment or segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as target markets). Positioning is part of the broader marketing strategy which includes three basic decision levels, namely segmentation, targeting and positioning, sometimes known as the S-T-P approach:    In general terms, there are three broad types of positioning: functional, symbolic, and experiential position. Functional positions resolve problems, provide benefits to customers, or get favorable perception by investors (stock profile) and lenders. 1) The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and ; 2) The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment's business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably. Two customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions: A commonly cited definition of marketing is simply \"meeting needs profitably\". The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segments than it will for other, non-targeted customers.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

Accordingly, the winner will be \"cursed\" in one of two ways: either the winning bid will exceed the value of the auctioned asset making the winner worse off in absolute terms, or the value of the asset will be less than the bidder anticipated, so \n\n likely to overpay. It turns out that for a bidder's true estimate the expected value is negative, meaning that on average the winning bidder is overpaying. Savvy bidders will avoid the winner's curse by bid shading, or placing a bid that is below their ex ante estimation of the value of the item for sale—but equal to their ex post belief about the value of the item, \n\n A technique involving a buyer using another account (called a “shield”) to discourage other competitors from bidding by artificially increasing the price and then at the last moment withdrawing their bid to allow the actual buyer to win the auction with a lower price. In such cases, the winner will tend to be the bidder with the highest estimate, but the results of the auction will show that the remaining bidders' estimates of the item's value are less than that of the winner, giving the winner the impression that they \"bid too much\". Behaviorally and empirically, however, winner's curse is a common phenomenon, described in detail by Richard Thaler.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

Cost of transport is the efficiency in moving from one place to another ; Elasticity is the measurement of the proportional change of an economic variable in response to a change in another \n\n If, in contrast to the previous example, the consumer is inelastic, they will demand the same quantity no matter the price. Because the producer is elastic, the producer is very sensitive to price. A small drop in price leads to a large drop in the quantity produced. Because the consumer is inelastic, the quantity doesn't change much. Because the consumer is inelastic and the producer is elastic, the price changes dramatically. This is because he is selling fewer of the product due to the increased price, and his total revenue has fallen. The seller decides to increase the price to $15, and finds that his revenue ends up increasing. If an increase in price causes an increase in total revenue, then demand can be said to be inelastic, since the increase in price does not have a large impact on quantity demanded. Examples: \n\n Because the producer is inelastic, they will produce the same quantity no matter the price. Because the consumer is elastic, the consumer is very sensitive to price. Because the consumer is elastic, the quantity change is significant. Because the producer is inelastic, the price doesn't change much.

One major factor is the presence of information asymmetry, where buyers and sellers have different levels of knowledge regarding the goods or services being exchanged. As a result, both the buyers and sellers are worse off. Another factor that contributes to market failure in healthcare is moral hazard. In response to market failure, governments often resort to administered prices, which are regulated prices set for healthcare goods and services. While administered prices can address some of the issues caused by market failure, they can also lead to government failure. Buyers may receive unnecessary or suboptimal treatments, and sellers may face challenges in providing appropriate care while managing costs. Balancing market failure and regulatory failure is a complex task for societies, requiring careful consideration of incentives, information sharing, and regulatory frameworks to promote efficient and equitable healthcare delivery. As the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each of its connections. As the organization grows the probability of revenue leakage only increases. As in the used car market, potential sellers of medical services (physicians) often possess more knowledge about the quality of their services than potential buyers (patients). Due to this differential information, transactions that could benefit both parties may not occur. In an ideal competitive market, equally well-informed buyers and sellers would be able to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, when one party possesses more knowledge, these transactions do not take place, resulting in both the buyer and seller being worse off. This behavior can increase healthcare expenditures and further drive up costs for insurers or funders, leading to market failure. In response to market failure, some societies adopt administered pricing mechanisms, where prices for healthcare services are set by the government or other regulatory bodies. However, these administered prices can create their own set of challenges, such as inefficiencies and reduced incentives for healthcare providers. This is known as regulatory or government failure. Achieving a balance between market failure and regulatory failure is a complex task for societies. It requires careful consideration of various factors, including the promotion of competition, addressing information asymmetry, and implementing effective regulations to ensure the provision of quality healthcare while controlling costs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm's customers. With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their database, marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders—known as drip marketing. A natural or legal person who initially collects address data in the context of the sale of a product or service, has the right to use it for commercial purposes provided the customers have a prior opportunity to reject such communication where it was initially collected and subsequently. The first is the exception for existing customer relationships and the second for marketing of similar products and services. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations. Email marketing strategies commonly seek to achieve one or more of three primary objectives, to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads. Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.

Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user who needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider or using indirect channels with distributors or intermediaries. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective and exclusive distribution. It examines the share of the relevant product category sold by stores in which a given product has gained distribution. Often, outlets are weighted by their share of category sales or “all commodity” sales. Balancing a firm's efforts in “push” (building and maintaining reseller and distribution support) and “pull” (generating customer demand) is an ongoing strategic concern for marketers. On the other hand, the growth of supermarkets in many regions has seen the development of direct marketing and a reduced role for wholesale systems. Digital distribution (also referred to as content delivery, online distribution, or electronic software distribution (ESD), among others) is the delivery or distribution of digital media content such as audio, video, e-books, video games, and other software. The term is generally used to describe distribution over an online delivery medium, such as the Internet, thus bypassing physical distribution methods, such as paper, optical discs, and VHS videocassettes. The term online distribution is typically applied to freestanding products; downloadable add-ons for other products are more commonly known as downloadable content. Content distributed online may be streamed or downloaded, and often consists of books, films and television programs, \n\n Numeric distribution is based on the number of outlets that carry a product (that is, outlets that list at least one of the product’s stock-keeping units, or SKUs). Often, outlets are weighted by their share of category sales or “all commodity” sales.

Business can tap into business census type products published by Government departments to identify geographic regions that meet certain predefined criteria. Firmographics (also known as emporographics or feature based segmentation) is the business community's answer to demographic segmentation. It is commonly used in business-to-business markets (an estimated 81% of B2B marketers use this technique). Under this approach the target market is segmented based on features such as company size, industry sector or location usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and \n\n organization is a customer who is not directly connected to that organization. ; 2) An internal customer is a customer who is directly connected to an organization, and is usually (but not necessarily) internal to the organization. Internal customers are usually stakeholders, employees, or shareholders, but the definition also encompasses creditors and external regulators. In the 21st century customers are generally categorized into two types: A customer may or may not also be a consumer, but the two notions are distinct. A customer purchases goods; a consumer uses them. An ultimate customer may be a consumer as well, but just as equally may have purchased items for \n\nDefining the sub-segment of the market (no company can target 100% market share, also known as monopolization) ; Top-Down market sizing ; Bottom-Up analysis ; Competitor analysis To judge the potential future growth of a company, there needs to be an in-depth analysis of the target market. When a company or investor determines its market size, there are a few steps they need to consider to figure out how large the market really is: After the market is reasonably estimated, a financial forecast can be made based on the size of the market and how much a company thinks it can grow in a certain time period. The evaluation used a new Excel-based prioritization tool covering 22 criteria developed by PATH, the Maternal and Neonatal Directed Assessment of Technology (MANDATE) model, and consultations with experts. Complicated user requirements for technologies, especially for health workers without advanced training. Weak or nonexistent distribution systems. Disparate markets and small sales volumes that drive up costs for manufacturing and distribution. We identified these technologies by reviewing World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges in Global Health awards, and US Agency for International Development Saving Lives at Birth finalists, as well as by soliciting input from maternal health experts and other stakeholders. Because our review of the literature found that no existing assessment tool would meet our needs, PATH developed a strategic prioritization tool for the project [see Additional file 1]. The tool is a decision matrix consisting of 22 criteria, each representing a discrete element of the technology’s value proposition and potential for impact (see Table 1). The matrix captures a score for each criterion, a cumulative score, and score substantiation for each technology. To develop the criteria and related definitions, project staff consulted internal maternal health experts, commercial firms, and other sources . The tool and detailed information on the criteria, definitions, and process are available online at http://sites.path.org/mnhtech/assessment/tool/.

Positioning is part of the broader marketing strategy which includes three basic decision levels, namely segmentation, targeting and positioning, sometimes known as the S-T-P approach:    In general terms, there are three broad types of positioning: functional, symbolic, and experiential position. Functional positions resolve problems, provide benefits to customers, or get favorable perception by investors (stock profile) and lenders.

Given the prevalence of advertising-supported information goods online, it is important to understand how online advertising works. Economists have spent much effort in trying to quantify the returns to online advertising. One especially interesting aspect of online advertising is its ability to target customers using fine demographic and behavioral data. \"Instead of operating on the premise that price, determined by marketplace supply and demand, functioned as an information feedback system telling manufacturers how much to produce, the new breed of marketers maintained that markets could be created by.\" Brands have become better at advertising to social media, it allows them to reach a huge range of people \n\n ways for delivering a marketing message under the guise of independent product reviews and endorsements, or creating supposedly independent watchdog or review organizations. Advertising is mass and paid communication, with a fundamental purpose to deliver information, acquire attitudes and induce action beneficial to the advertiser – generally the sale of the product or service. This is used by advertising companies to get people to buy their products. A common practice is to purchase advertisements in magazines and newspapers where editors and reporters write about the products or company. The goal is to reinforce the marketing message and earn even greater levels of awareness and recall of the brand. Generally, getting the advertisement as close to the editorial content is considered important to maximize the awareness effects. Some publishers reject the notion and allow the editorialized advertiser to match the fee and retain advertisement-editorial integrity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.
