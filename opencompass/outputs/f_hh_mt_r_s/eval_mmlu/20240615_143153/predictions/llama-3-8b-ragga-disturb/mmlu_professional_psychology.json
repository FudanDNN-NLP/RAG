FTT in Older Adults The structural integrity of the prefrontal cortex in older adults is preferentially diminished relative to other brain regions. The normal age progression results in a decline in frontal lobe function. Therefore, older adults are more vulnerable to inaccurate information, tending to believe without an appropriate level of doubt for a given item of information. There are direct implications for older person’ vulnerability to financial fraud, tendencies to remember false information as true, which influences judgment. Increased credulity during aging is associated with declines in prefrontal cortex functioning. Therefore, age-related declines in ability of the prefrontal cortex to doubt provide a compelling rationale as to why highly knowledgeable and intelligent adult are often susceptible to deception and fraud. 14% hippocampal volume reduction and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory when compared to elderly subjects with decreased or moderate cortisol levels. An example may be found in the London taxi drivers, as the anterior hippocampus was hypothesized to decrease in volume as a result of elevated cortisol levels from stress. ; Acute stress, a more common form of stress, results in the release of adrenal steroids resulting in impaired short-term and working memory processes such as selective attention, memory consolidation, as well as long-term potentiation. The human brain has a limited short-term memory capacity to process information, which results in constant competition between stimuli to become processed. Cognitive control processes such as \n\nHenry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 – December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His case played a very important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Most of Molaison's two hippocampi were removed bilaterally. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. After the surgery was successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the 1–2-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio. In this way, his case was taken to provide information about brain pathology, and helped to form theories of normal memory function. In particular, his apparent ability to complete tasks that require recall from short-term memory and procedural memory but not long-term episodic memory suggests that recall from these memory systems may be mediated, at least in part, by different areas of the brain. Similarly, his ability to recall long-term memories that existed well before his surgery, but inability to create new long-term memories, suggests that encoding and retrieval of long-term memory information may also be mediated by distinct systems. It has provided broad evidence for the rejection of old theories and the formation of new theories on human memory, in particular about its processes and the underlying neural structures (cf. Further evidence for this assumption has been gained by studies of other patients with lesions of their medial temporal lobe structures. Despite his amnesic symptoms, Molaison performed quite normally in tests of intellectual ability, indicating that some memory functions (e.g., short-term memories, stores for words, phonemes, etc.) However, for sentence-level language comprehension and production, Molaison exhibited the same deficits and sparing as in memory. This was tested in a working memory experiment involving the recall of previously presented numbers; in fact, his performance was no worse than that of control subjects (Smith & Kosslyn, 2007). It further supports the general distinction between short-term and long-term stores of memory). These findings provide evidence that memory of skills and repetition priming rely on different neural structures than memories of episodes and facts; whereas procedural memory and repetition priming do not rely on the medial temporal structures removed from Molaison, semantic and episodic memory do (cf. This finding is remarkable since Molaison had moved to the house five years after his surgery and hence, given his severe anterograde amnesia and insights from other cases, the common expectation was that the acquisition of topographical memories would have been impaired as well. In addition to his topographical memory, Molaison showed some learning in a picture memorization-recognition task, as well as in a famous faces recognition test, but in the latter only when he was provided with a phonemic cue. Molaison's heavy impairment in certain spatial tasks provides further evidence for the association of the hippocampus with spatial memory (Kolb & Whishaw, 1996).

FTT in Older Adults The structural integrity of the prefrontal cortex in older adults is preferentially diminished relative to other brain regions. The normal age progression results in a decline in frontal lobe function. Therefore, older adults are more vulnerable to inaccurate information, tending to believe without an appropriate level of doubt for a given item of information. There are direct implications for older person’ vulnerability to financial fraud, tendencies to remember false information as true, which influences judgment. Increased credulity during aging is associated with declines in prefrontal cortex functioning. Therefore, age-related declines in ability of the prefrontal cortex to doubt provide a compelling rationale as to why highly knowledgeable and intelligent adult are often susceptible to deception and fraud. 14% hippocampal volume reduction and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory when compared to elderly subjects with decreased or moderate cortisol levels. An example may be found in the London taxi drivers, as the anterior hippocampus was hypothesized to decrease in volume as a result of elevated cortisol levels from stress. ; Acute stress, a more common form of stress, results in the release of adrenal steroids resulting in impaired short-term and working memory processes such as selective attention, memory consolidation, as well as long-term potentiation. The human brain has a limited short-term memory capacity to process information, which results in constant competition between stimuli to become processed. Cognitive control processes such as \n\nHenry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 – December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His case played a very important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Most of Molaison's two hippocampi were removed bilaterally. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. After the surgery was successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the 1–2-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio.

If the level is within the therapeutic range, the client is most likely compliant with medication therapy. In this situation, the nurse can be charged with battery because the nurse administers a medication that the client has refused. If the physician writes an order that requires clarification, it is the nurse’s responsibility to contact the physician for clarification. Generally there are only two instances in which the informed consent of an adult client is not needed. One instance is when an emergency is present and delaying treatment for the purpose of obtaining informed consent would result in injury or death to the client. The second instance is when the client waives the right to give informed consent. Since this activity directly affects client care, this would be done before reading the stack of mail. The nurse needs to stay with the client and consult with the nurse manager about the situation. In this situation, the nurse has attempted to explain the reasons for being uncomfortable with the surgeon but was unable to resolve the conflict. External disasters occur in the community, and many victims may be brought to the emergency room for care. The nurse manager would not ask emergency medical services to take the victims to another hospital or close the emergency room temporarily to incoming clients. If a nurse feels that an assignment is more difficult than the assignment delegated to other nurses on the unit, the nurse would most appropriately discuss the assignment with the nurse manager of the neurological unit. A nurse would not refuse an assignment. Specific situations may be present in which a nurse should not take care of a specific client, for example, if a pregnant nurse is assigned to care for a client with rubella or a client with an internal radiation implant. The nurse would not return to the cardiac unit; this would be client abandonment, and this action does not address the conflict directly. The nurse manager should handle this problem directly with the nurse who is performing this action and should initially review the skills checklist of the nurse who is tying the knots to assess if this skill has ever been performed and validated. The physician is notified of the adverse reactions, the nursing interventions that have been implemented, and the client’s response to the interventions. If physical abuse or neglect is suspected, the priority nursing action is to assess the client, treat any physical injuries, and ensure that the client is safe. The nurse also notifies the physician and the social worker to investigate the situation. Although the nurse may be involved in obtaining psychiatric assistance for the son, this is not the priority action. A client who complains of severe pain may need realignment or may have traction weights ordered that are too heavy. The nurse realigns the client, and if that is ineffective, then calls the physician. The client should be medicated only after an attempt has been made to determine and treat the cause. When the client has a residual air leak or pneumothorax, clamping the chest tube may precipitate a tension pneumothorax because the air has no escape route. The client would not be instructed to inhale. The meeting follows a January 16, 2015 decision by the Board to require that Texas physicians have a “face-to-face visit” with patients. Many allied health professional boards and professionals are following these events with keen interest, wondering where decision-makers will rest on these pivotal issues for psychology, counseling, social work, behavior analysis, speech pathology, physical therapy, etc. Ethical standards and guidelines issued by leading mental health professional associations regarding telepractice typically do not take a stand for or against a requirement for in-person intakes or assessments. The fascinating twist on the issue however, is that most telemedicine does not occur directly between a physician as an independent practitioner and a patient. Whether a nurse who takes vital signs, or a medic who serves in the military, or a “collaborator” who is a para-professional located whereever the patient is in geographic space, an accountable, trained third party is available to outline and present relevant issues for intake and assessment. It therefore is the move away from such a third party that raises concerns for medical as well as behavioral professionals. When providing telepsychology services, considering client/patient preferences for such services is important. Psychologists are encouraged to carefully examine the unique benefits of delivering telepsychology services (e.g., access to care, access to consulting services, client convenience, accommodating client special needs, etc.) when determining whether or not to offer telepsychology services. Moreover, psychologists are aware of such other factors as geographic location, organizational culture, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), and, as appropriate, medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the telepsychology services being offered. Furthermore, psychologists are encouraged to communicate any risks and benefits of the telepsychology services to be offered to the client/patient and document such communication. In addition, psychologists may consider some initial in-person contact with the client/patient to facilitate an active discussion on these issues and/or conduct the initial assessment. The APA statement above gives a clear warning, but apparently leaves the decision about in-person intake and assessment to the clinician. However, the vast majority of telehealth-related research uses telehealth systems for follow-up only, and not for initial intake. What do you think of the need for in-person assessments for telemental health? There were some restrictions, but generally, physicians were allowed to prescribe medication without an in-person evaluation, however, the patient had to be in an “established medical” site (though not necessarily one with a DEA registration) and a qualified presenter had to be on site to provide a physical. The problem with the prior allowances by the Texas Medical Board is that it was insufficient compared to the Ryan Haight Act – a federal law passed in 2008 that requires physicians to preform an in-person assessment prior to prescribing medications. Physicians are exempt from the Act, though, if they meet the federal definition of practicing telemedicine (in brief, patient is located in a medical facility that has a DEA registration). If teledoc was allowing their physicians to write scripts without first seeing them, and the patients were not seen in a site that was exempt from the act, those physicians would thereby in violation of federal law. As far as psychologists and other mental health therapists go, I would not mind a state or federal law requiring an in-person assessment first, as that is how I currently practice now, but don’t know if it’s necessary. This is not something psychologists generally involve themselves in, though some psychologists are noticing that blood pressuring monitoring, etc are part of the Physician Quality Reporting System for psychologists who see Medicaid participants. There has to be someone on the other end, though, to assist, but these devices will likely lead to less need for an in-person assessment. Not everyone is appropriate for telemedicine and conducting such a session prior to such an evaluation is clinically inappropriate (my professional opinion). Besides being able to assess for appropriateness of telemedicine, you can more easily review informed consent forms, get signatures, obtain baseline screening and other clinical assessments, and get a better physical assessment of the person. The problem with requiring face-to-face assessments for all mental health services is that it is too global a restriction. I can think of many, maybe the majority, of clinical issues that might arise and could be appropriately and effectively addressed beginning with a tele-assessment as well as other situations where tele-assessment in the absence of any other support could be a very risky decision. What I see as a possible long term negative affect is that telehealth will become the norm and it will become too expensive to see a doctor live. I also believe in my counseling practice that people can easily scam you from a distance and it’s much harder in person. It is entirely possible for that level of care to be delivered by behavioral professionals, but professionals need very specific training to know how to do that. For courses to learn how to deliver legal, ethical and solid clinical services through distance counseling, consider taking the courses we offer in this area: http://www.telehealth.org/courses They are all online, have NBCC CE approval and will qualify you for the Distance Credentialed Counselor (DCC) credential. Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research and practice), and the Psy.D. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy. Clinical psychology is distinguished from psychiatry. Although practitioners in both fields are mental health professionals, clinical psychologists treat mental disorders primarily through psychotherapy and have a doctorate in Psychology or a Doctor of Psychology degree. Currently, five U.S. states, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho, allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat mental disorders primarily through medication and have a medical degree. History\n\nThe earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical, and/or medical perspectives. While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his \"talking cure\" in Vienna, that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began. Early clinical psychology\n\nBy the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \"pure\" science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867–1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities. Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, The Psychological Clinic, where he coined the term \"clinical psychology\", defined as \"the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change\". Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. World War II and the integration of treatment\n\nWhen World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the Boulder Model, for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology. Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health Service with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society. Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree\nBy the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many, the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or Vail Model—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. A changing profession\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication. Professional practice\n\nClinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on research into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding). In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Training and certification to practice\n\nClinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement. In the US, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in Ph.D. programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in Psy.D. In the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych. ), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. Entry into these programs is highly competitive and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:\nGraduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree\nCompletion of supervised clinical experience or internship\nPassing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination\n\nAll U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA). In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law \"registered psychologist\" and \"practitioner psychologist\"; in addition, the specialist title \"clinical psychologist\" is also restricted by law. Assessment\nAn important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypothesis about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnosis) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination. Many psychological assessment measures are restricted for use by those with advanced training in mental health. For instance, Pearson (one of the many companies with rights and protection of psychological assessment tools) separates who can administer, interpret, and report on certain tests. Those who intend to use assessment tools at Qualification Level B must hold a master's degree in psychology, education, speech language pathology, occupational therapy, social work, counseling, or in a field closely related to the intended use of the assessment, and formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments. Those with access to Qualification C (highest level) assessment measures must hold a doctorate degree in psychology, education, or a closely related field with formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments related to the intended use of the assessment. Other commonly used personality assessment measures include the PAI and the NEO\nNeuropsychological tests – Neuropsychological tests consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. Diagnostic Measurement Tools – Clinical psychologists are able to diagnose psychological disorders and related disorders found in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. Some of these include the SCID-IV, the MINI, as well as some specific to certain psychological disorders such as the CAPS-5 for trauma, the ASEBA, and the K-SADS for affective and Schizophrenia in children. Clinical observation – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing. Diagnostic impressions\n\nAfter assessment, clinical psychologists may provide a diagnostic impression. Many countries use the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Both are nosological systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including symptoms and signs. Several new models are being discussed, including a \"dimensional model\" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the five factor model of personality) and a \"psychosocial model\", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account. Clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use formulation—an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors. Clinical v. mechanical prediction \nClinical assessment can be characterized as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are made on the basis of what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. A 2009 survey of practicing clinical psychologists found that clinicians almost exclusively use their clinical judgment to make behavioral predictions for their patients, including diagnosis and prognosis. Intervention\n\nPsychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)\n \nThe methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. Four main schools\nMany clinical psychologists are integrative or eclectic and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model. In the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The British Psychological Society Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy. In the US, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanism, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy. Psychodynamic\n\nThe psychodynamic perspective developed out of the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various defenses used to keep them in check. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term psychodynamic psychology, with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state. Humanistic/Experiential\n\nHumanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysts or behavioral health counselors. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition. Other therapeutic perspectives\n\nThere exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. The therapist emphasizes the client's ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living. This therapy is perhaps best known for using techniques designed to increase self-awareness, the best-known perhaps being the \"empty chair technique.\" Such techniques are intended to explore resistance to \"authentic contact\", resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete \"unfinished business\". Since \"mental illness\" and \"mental health\" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist. Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy, and coherence therapy. It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or transcendent states of consciousness. Multiculturalism – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. Feminism – Feminist therapy is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioural genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem. Professional ethics\n\nThe field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy. In the UK the British Psychological Society has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. Comparison with other mental health professions\n\nPsychiatry\n\nAlthough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and can use psychotropic medications as a method of addressing the illness—although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning. Clinical psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a  movement for psychologists to have prescribing privileges. To date, medical psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Louisiana, the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, and the United States Military. Traditionally, counseling psychologists helped people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. However, that distinction has faded over time, and of the counseling psychologists who do not go into academia (which does not involve treatment or diagnosis), the majority of counseling psychologists treat mental illness alongside clinical psychologists. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling. Counseling psychology as a field values multiculturalism  and social advocacy, often stimulating research in multicultural issues. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. School psychology\nSchool psychologists are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically. Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities. Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness, there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology. It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with client groups and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client. It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad. A critical psychology movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a \"psy complex\", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest. An October 2009 editorial in the journal Nature suggests that a large number of clinical psychology practitioners in the United States consider scientific evidence to be \"less important than their personal – that is, subjective – clinical experience.\" See also\n\n Anti-psychiatry\n Applied psychology\n Clinical Associate (Psychology)\n Clinical neuropsychology\n Clinical trial\n List of clinical psychologists\n List of credentials in psychology\n List of psychotherapies\n Outline of psychology\n Psychiatric and mental health nursing\n Psychoneuroimmunology\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican Academy of Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Association for Marriage and Family Therapy \nAmerican Board of Professional Psychology\nAnnual Review of Clinical Psychology\nAPA Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12)\nAssociation of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) \nNAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness\nNational Institute of Mental Health\n\n \nHealth care occupations\nBehavioural sciences\n\n the top of the Eiffel Tower is not the only cause of death, since there exist numerous different causes of death.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional psychology.

The psychologist: tells the client to call a physician immediately and to come in at 9:00 A.M. on Monday for a session. The psychologist makes no other attempt to intervene, and the client dies later that evening without making any other calls for assistance. In this situation, the psychologist's behavior was clearly\nA. unethical, because the client's needs were not addressed more directly\nB. unethical, because the psychologist should have delayed the trip and given the client an appointment for that afternoon\nC. unethical, because the psychologist should have called a physician directly\nD. ethical, because it was not possible to determine whether or not the client was being manipulative\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "gold": "A",
        "context": "If the level is below the therapeutic range, the client may be noncompliant with the medication regimen. If the level is within the therapeutic range, the client is most likely compliant with medication therapy. In this situation, the nurse can be charged with battery because the nurse administers a medication that the client has refused. If the physician writes an order that requires clarification, it is the nurse’s responsibility to contact the physician for clarification. Generally there are only two instances in which the informed consent of an adult client is not needed. One instance is when an emergency is present and delaying treatment for the purpose of obtaining informed consent would result in injury or death to the client. The second instance is when the client waives the right to give informed consent. Since this activity directly affects client care, this would be done before reading the stack of mail. The nurse needs to stay with the client and consult with the nurse manager about the situation. In this situation, the nurse has attempted to explain the reasons for being uncomfortable with the surgeon but was unable to resolve the conflict. External disasters occur in the community, and many victims may be brought to the emergency room for care. The nurse manager would not ask emergency medical services to take the victims to another hospital or close the emergency room temporarily to incoming clients. If a nurse feels that an assignment is more difficult than the assignment delegated to other nurses on the unit, the nurse would most appropriately discuss the assignment with the nurse manager of the neurological unit. A nurse would not refuse an assignment. Specific situations may be present in which a nurse should not take care of a specific client, for example, if a pregnant nurse is assigned to care for a client with rubella or a client with an internal radiation implant. The nurse would not return to the cardiac unit; this would be client abandonment, and this action does not address the conflict directly. The nurse manager should handle this problem directly with the nurse who is performing this action and should initially review the skills checklist of the nurse who is tying the knots to assess if this skill has ever been performed and validated. The physician is notified of the adverse reactions, the nursing interventions that have been implemented, and the client’s response to the interventions. If physical abuse or neglect is suspected, the priority nursing action is to assess the client, treat any physical injuries, and ensure that the client is safe. The nurse also notifies the physician and the social worker to investigate the situation. Although the nurse may be involved in obtaining psychiatric assistance for the son, this is not the priority action. A client who complains of severe pain may need realignment or may have traction weights ordered that are too heavy. The nurse realigns the client, and if that is ineffective, then calls the physician. The client should be medicated only after an attempt has been made to determine and treat the cause. When the client has a residual air leak or pneumothorax, clamping the chest tube may precipitate a tension pneumothorax because the air has no escape route. The client would not be instructed to inhale. The meeting follows a January 16, 2015 decision by the Board to require that Texas physicians have a “face-to-face visit” with patients. Many allied health professional boards and professionals are following these events with keen interest, wondering where decision-makers will rest on these pivotal issues for psychology, counseling, social work, behavior analysis, speech pathology, physical therapy, etc. Ethical standards and guidelines issued by leading mental health professional associations regarding telepractice typically do not take a stand for or against a requirement for in-person intakes or assessments. The fascinating twist on the issue however, is that most telemedicine does not occur directly between a physician as an independent practitioner and a patient. Whether a nurse who takes vital signs, or a medic who serves in the military, or a “collaborator” who is a para-professional located whereever the patient is in geographic space, an accountable, trained third party is available to outline and present relevant issues for intake and assessment. It therefore is the move away from such a third party that raises concerns for medical as well as behavioral professionals. When providing telepsychology services, considering client/patient preferences for such services is important. Psychologists are encouraged to carefully examine the unique benefits of delivering telepsychology services (e.g., access to care, access to consulting services, client convenience, accommodating client special needs, etc.) when determining whether or not to offer telepsychology services. Moreover, psychologists are aware of such other factors as geographic location, organizational culture, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), and, as appropriate, medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the telepsychology services being offered. Furthermore, psychologists are encouraged to communicate any risks and benefits of the telepsychology services to be offered to the client/patient and document such communication. In addition, psychologists may consider some initial in-person contact with the client/patient to facilitate an active discussion on these issues and/or conduct the initial assessment. The APA statement above gives a clear warning, but apparently leaves the decision about in-person intake and assessment to the clinician. However, the vast majority of telehealth-related research uses telehealth systems for follow-up only, and not for initial intake. What do you think of the need for in-person assessments for telemental health? There were some restrictions, but generally, physicians were allowed to prescribe medication without an in-person evaluation, however, the patient had to be in an “established medical” site (though not necessarily one with a DEA registration) and a qualified presenter had to be on site to provide a physical. The problem with the prior allowances by the Texas Medical Board is that it was insufficient compared to the Ryan Haight Act – a federal law passed in 2008 that requires physicians to preform an in-person assessment prior to prescribing medications. Physicians are exempt from the Act, though, if they meet the federal definition of practicing telemedicine (in brief, patient is located in a medical facility that has a DEA registration). If teledoc was allowing their physicians to write scripts without first seeing them, and the patients were not seen in a site that was exempt from the act, those physicians would thereby in violation of federal law. As far as psychologists and other mental health therapists go, I would not mind a state or federal law requiring an in-person assessment first, as that is how I currently practice now, but don’t know if it’s necessary. This is not something psychologists generally involve themselves in, though some psychologists are noticing that blood pressuring monitoring, etc are part of the Physician Quality Reporting System for psychologists who see Medicaid participants. There has to be someone on the other end, though, to assist, but these devices will likely lead to less need for an in-person assessment. Not everyone is appropriate for telemedicine and conducting such a session prior to such an evaluation is clinically inappropriate (my professional opinion). Besides being able to assess for appropriateness of telemedicine, you can more easily review informed consent forms, get signatures, obtain baseline screening and other clinical assessments, and get a better physical assessment of the person. The problem with requiring face-to-face assessments for all mental health services is that it is too global a restriction. I can think of many, maybe the majority, of clinical issues that might arise and could be appropriately and effectively addressed beginning with a tele-assessment as well as other situations where tele-assessment in the absence of any other support could be a very risky decision. What I see as a possible long term negative affect is that telehealth will become the norm and it will become too expensive to see a doctor live. I also believe in my counseling practice that people can easily scam you from a distance and it’s much harder in person. It is entirely possible for that level of care to be delivered by behavioral professionals, but professionals need very specific training to know how to do that. For courses to learn how to deliver legal, ethical and solid clinical services through distance counseling, consider taking the courses we offer in this area: http://www.telehealth.org/courses They are all online, have NBCC CE approval and will qualify you for the Distance Credentialed Counselor (DCC) credential. Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research and practice), and the Psy.D. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy. Clinical psychology is distinguished from psychiatry. Although practitioners in both fields are mental health professionals, clinical psychologists treat mental disorders primarily through psychotherapy and have a doctorate in Psychology or a Doctor of Psychology degree. Currently, five U.S. states, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho, allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat mental disorders primarily through medication and have a medical degree. History\n\nThe earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical, and/or medical perspectives. While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his \"talking cure\" in Vienna, that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began. Early clinical psychology\n\nBy the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \"pure\" science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867–1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities. Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, The Psychological Clinic, where he coined the term \"clinical psychology\", defined as \"the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change\". Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. World War II and the integration of treatment\n\nWhen World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the Boulder Model, for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology. Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health Service with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society. Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree\nBy the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many, the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or Vail Model—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. A changing profession\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication. Professional practice\n\nClinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on research into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding). In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Training and certification to practice\n\nClinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement. In the US, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in Ph.D. programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in Psy.D. In the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych. ), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. Entry into these programs is highly competitive and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:\nGraduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree\nCompletion of supervised clinical experience or internship\nPassing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination\n\nAll U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA). In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law \"registered psychologist\" and \"practitioner psychologist\"; in addition, the specialist title \"clinical psychologist\" is also restricted by law. Assessment\nAn important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypothesis about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnosis) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination. Many psychological assessment measures are restricted for use by those with advanced training in mental health. For instance, Pearson (one of the many companies with rights and protection of psychological assessment tools) separates who can administer, interpret, and report on certain tests. Those who intend to use assessment tools at Qualification Level B must hold a master's degree in psychology, education, speech language pathology, occupational therapy, social work, counseling, or in a field closely related to the intended use of the assessment, and formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments. Those with access to Qualification C (highest level) assessment measures must hold a doctorate degree in psychology, education, or a closely related field with formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments related to the intended use of the assessment. Other commonly used personality assessment measures include the PAI and the NEO\nNeuropsychological tests – Neuropsychological tests consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. Diagnostic Measurement Tools – Clinical psychologists are able to diagnose psychological disorders and related disorders found in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. Some of these include the SCID-IV, the MINI, as well as some specific to certain psychological disorders such as the CAPS-5 for trauma, the ASEBA, and the K-SADS for affective and Schizophrenia in children. Clinical observation – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing. Diagnostic impressions\n\nAfter assessment, clinical psychologists may provide a diagnostic impression. Many countries use the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Both are nosological systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including symptoms and signs. Several new models are being discussed, including a \"dimensional model\" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the five factor model of personality) and a \"psychosocial model\", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account. Clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use formulation—an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors. Clinical v. mechanical prediction \nClinical assessment can be characterized as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are made on the basis of what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. A 2009 survey of practicing clinical psychologists found that clinicians almost exclusively use their clinical judgment to make behavioral predictions for their patients, including diagnosis and prognosis. Intervention\n\nPsychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)\n \nThe methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. Four main schools\nMany clinical psychologists are integrative or eclectic and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model. In the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The British Psychological Society Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy. In the US, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanism, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy. Psychodynamic\n\nThe psychodynamic perspective developed out of the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various defenses used to keep them in check. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term psychodynamic psychology, with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state. Humanistic/Experiential\n\nHumanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysts or behavioral health counselors. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition. Other therapeutic perspectives\n\nThere exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. The therapist emphasizes the client's ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living. This therapy is perhaps best known for using techniques designed to increase self-awareness, the best-known perhaps being the \"empty chair technique.\" Such techniques are intended to explore resistance to \"authentic contact\", resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete \"unfinished business\". Since \"mental illness\" and \"mental health\" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist. Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy, and coherence therapy. It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or transcendent states of consciousness. Multiculturalism – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. Feminism – Feminist therapy is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioural genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem. Professional ethics\n\nThe field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy. In the UK the British Psychological Society has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. Comparison with other mental health professions\n\nPsychiatry\n\nAlthough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and can use psychotropic medications as a method of addressing the illness—although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning. Clinical psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a  movement for psychologists to have prescribing privileges. To date, medical psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Louisiana, the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, and the United States Military. Traditionally, counseling psychologists helped people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. However, that distinction has faded over time, and of the counseling psychologists who do not go into academia (which does not involve treatment or diagnosis), the majority of counseling psychologists treat mental illness alongside clinical psychologists. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling. Counseling psychology as a field values multiculturalism  and social advocacy, often stimulating research in multicultural issues. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. School psychology\nSchool psychologists are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically. Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities. Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness, there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology. It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with client groups and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client. It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad. A critical psychology movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a \"psy complex\", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest. An October 2009 editorial in the journal Nature suggests that a large number of clinical psychology practitioners in the United States consider scientific evidence to be \"less important than their personal – that is, subjective – clinical experience.\" See also\n\n Anti-psychiatry\n Applied psychology\n Clinical Associate (Psychology)\n Clinical neuropsychology\n Clinical trial\n List of clinical psychologists\n List of credentials in psychology\n List of psychotherapies\n Outline of psychology\n Psychiatric and mental health nursing\n Psychoneuroimmunology\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican Academy of Clinical Psychology\nAmerican Association for Marriage and Family Therapy \nAmerican Board of Professional Psychology\nAnnual Review of Clinical Psychology\nAPA Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12)\nAssociation of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) \nNAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness\nNational Institute of Mental Health\n\n \nHealth care occupations\nBehavioural sciences\n\n the top of the Eiffel Tower is not the only cause of death, since there exist numerous different causes of death.\n\n"

Sociologist Wendy Manning echoes their conclusion that \"[The] studies reveal that children raised in same-sex parent families fare just as well as children \n\nPreterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for preterm birth include a personal or familial history of preterm delivery, ethnicity and low socioeconomic status yet the ability to predict preterm delivery before the onset of preterm labour evades clinical practice. Evidence suggests that genetics may play a role in the multi-factorial pathophysiology of preterm birth. Collaborations have been established between clinical lab services, the provincial health service provider and researchers to create an interdisciplinary study design for the All Our Babies Study. Women provide informed consent for blood sample collection, linkage to medical records and complete questionnaires related to prenatal health, service utilization, social support, emotional and physical health, demographics, and breast and infant feeding. Establishing these partnerships during the study design phase and maintaining these relationships through the duration of the study provides the unique opportunity to investigate the multi-causal factors of preterm birth. Preterm birth remains poorly understood in modern society despite accounting for 75% of perinatal mortality [1, 2]. Moreover, the rate of preterm birth, that is birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation, has been on the rise for the past 3 decades in many developed countries including Canada, the USA and European nations where current rates range between 5-12% . Infants born preterm are at increased risks for neonatal complications and associated long-term morbidity  such as developmental delays, hearing and vision impairments, respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral palsy and retinopathy of prematurity, prolonging the financial, emotional and stress-related costs of prematurity well beyond the care received within neonatal intensive care units. The risk for adverse neonatal outcomes is inversely related to gestational age at birth with the highest morbidity among those infants delivered prior to 28 completed weeks of pregnancy (early preterm)  despite technological advances and improved medical treatments having greatly increased the survival of these infants [6, 7]. Recent studies have shown that these late preterm infants are at higher risk for adverse acute and long-term outcomes when compared to term infants . The pathophysiology of preterm birth is complex due to multi-factorial causes and its heterogeneous nature. Preterm birth is often categorized as (1) iatrogenic when delivery is a consequence of medical intervention (30-35%); (2) spontaneous when it occurs after spontaneous labour with intact membranes (40-45%); or (3) the result of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) (25-30%) . While gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction have all been associated with iatrogenic preterm birth, the underlying causes of spontaneous preterm birth are less clear. Reported risk factors are widespread and diverse, supporting the hypothesis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the pathophysiology of spontaneous preterm birth. Highly associated risk factors include a previous preterm birth or a relative with preterm birth  or a black racial background , suggesting genetic causes. Other demographic factors such as low socioeconomic status  and maternal stress  have shown an association, indicating that the environment contributes to the etiology of spontaneous preterm birth. Several groups have investigated the relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the promoter of the TNFα gene (G-308>A) (referred to as the TNF-2 allele) and preterm birth, but inconsistent results have been reported [18–21]. A recent meta-analysis of seven studies  found no association between preterm parturition and the TNF-2 allele. These inconsistencies may be the result of gene-environment interactions impacting the effects of potential genetic predispositions to preterm birth. reported an increased risk of preterm delivery being associated with both the TNF-2 allele and the presence of bacterial vaginosis, but not with either factor alone  suggesting a synergistic interaction. These findings highlight the complexity of understanding preterm birth and the need for an interdisciplinary approach, a strategy embraced by the Preterm Birth International Collaborative (PREBIC) in recently published guidelines for preterm birth research . Despite our growing awareness that infection, inflammation, stress and other risk factors contribute to the pathophysiology of preterm birth, predicting which women will deliver preterm remains an ongoing challenge. Many biomarkers for preterm birth have been suggested and explored such as fetal fibronectin [27, 28], maternal corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) , and cervical length  however all have had limitations such as low positive predictive values, low sensitivity or poor specificity  in addition to high inter-individual variability, which limit their translation into clinical settings. The evidence also suggests that an interdisciplinary approach is required to understand preterm birth pathophysiology. To examine the relative impact of genes and environment on the risk of preterm birth by exploring the interactions between medical history, gene expression patterns and environmental variables. Women that consent to the release of their information are subsequently contacted by telephone to determine eligibility, inform them about the study and invite them to participate. Questionnaires were developed to address the objectives of the All Our Babies Cohort Study and included input from academics, stakeholders and decision makers. These questionnaires (available on request) assess demographics, pregnancy history, service utilization, nutrition and exercise practices, mental health, social support, lifestyle and life history, and breastfeeding experiences through questions designed for this study as well as the following validated instruments: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale , Spielberger State Anxiety Scale , MOS Social Support Scale , Perceived Stress Scale , T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk , Parenting Morale Index , the Parental Expectations Scale for parenting self-efficacy , and the MCH Feeding Scale (personal communication, M. Ramsay, Feeding Problem Questionnaire 2003). The questionnaires were pilot tested prior to study commencement and revised for unclear wording. The Alberta Perinatal Health (APH) database is an Alberta-based database that contains prenatal maternal and birth outcome information from all recorded births in the province. This enables the questionnaire data to be linked to their APH administrative data about birth outcomes, and to examine medical records to verify circumstances associated with preterm birth. All women who receive prenatal viral serology phlebotomy by Calgary Laboratory Service and consent to be contacted by researchers are contacted via telephone. Transcriptomic profiles from maternal blood samples collected at 18-22 weeks and 28-32 weeks of pregnancy will be compared between two groups (women who deliver at term and women who deliver preterm) for patterns predictive of preterm birth. Health service utilization, maternal social support, psychosocial well-being, mental health, breastfeeding and parenting support at four months postpartum will be compared between term and preterm deliveries. The relative contribution of the environmental risk and the genetic risk will be compared between term and preterm deliveries. Therefore, with a preterm birth rate of 9.1% in Alberta, an anticipated miscarriage rate of 5% and an anticipated loss to follow-up rate of 15% based on experience with other Alberta based cohorts , 2200 women will be enrolled in the All Our Babies Cohort Study. The impact of access to routine prenatal care and health services on maternal variables at four months postpartum will be compared among the entire cohort. Although the sample size calculations for the All Our Babies Cohort Study were derived for the microarray analysis, the sample size of 1800 women is adequate to describe differences between groups with respect to health service utilization, maternal social support, psychosocial well-being, mental health, breastfeeding and parenting support using logistic regression [45–47]. For participants unable or unwilling to travel to the laboratory clinic, the research team will send a certified mobile phlebotomist to the women's home or other neutral location of her choice for the blood collections. Women and their health care providers therefore do not need to do anything at the time of delivery for the study. Based on women's consent to participate in follow-up studies of 97% and with dedicated retention strategies, it is anticipated that no more than 10% of study participants will be lost to follow-up into the preschool years. Cases and controls will be 'loosely matched' such that each group has a similar distribution of maternal ages, prepregnancy body mass indexes and smoking status. Participant characteristics will be assessed and compared to the pregnant and parenting population in the province of Alberta and nationwide across Canada. There are also no direct medical benefits to the participants nor their infants for participating in the All Our Babies Cohort Study. The rate of preterm birth is on the rise in the developed world. Alberta has the highest provincial preterm birth rate in Canada, the causes of which remain unexplained. The All Our Babies Cohort Study is strategically situated to examine the environmental, medical and genetic factors impacting preterm birth in Alberta and seeks to exploit their predictive properties for future clinical screening of all pregnant women. Should gene expression patterns predictive of spontaneous preterm birth be elucidated or gene-environment interactions protective against or synergistic for a spontaneous preterm birth outcome be discovered, the detailed phenotypic information will inform validation endeavors. In addition, this study will improve our understanding of how social support and social services impact spontaneous preterm birth in Calgary. The delivery of health services in the province of Alberta is currently undergoing reorganization making the assessment of women's needs during pregnancy very timely to inform service and program development and change of healthcare policies. The comprehensive questionnaire data obtained from participants in the All Our Babies Cohort Study combined with data from medical records provides a concise record of local health practices and the impact of practice on maternal-fetal and newborn health. The results of the study will provide the opportunity to describe the mental health and psychosocial characteristics of mothers living in Calgary as well as estimates of the impact of these characteristics on birth and the parenting experience. The All Our Babies Cohort Study will also record women's prenatal care experience in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing prenatal care. In addition, the information will enable evaluation of the relationships between access to routine prenatal care on postpartum depression, parenting morale, anxiety, stress, social support, lifestyle choices such as smoking, drug use and alcohol consumption, breastfeeding initiation, duration and challenges and postpartum use of health care services. Participants are involved in the study for approximately one year's time. It is anticipated that sample collections will be completed by spring 2011, all participants will have delivered their infant(s) by summer 2011 and data collection will be completed by fall 2011. Participants have been asked about their interest in participating in follow-up studies, potentially allowing for further research on early determinants of child and adult health outcomes. Complex preterm phenotypes are determined by genetic, physiological and environmental factors interacting at the cellular, organ, systemic, and lifestyle levels. The All Our Babies Cohort Study is gathering extensive detailed data on the gene expression profiles, medical history, lifestyle, demographics, physical and mental well-being, and neighbourhoods of the participants to predict preterm birth in asymptomatic women. The research team, community laboratory service and provincial health service provider are intimately partnered to facilitate multiple aspects of the study process. Recruitment, biological sample collection, and accessing medical record data are made possible by the academic-clinical collaborations that are the foundation of the All Our Babies Cohort Study. This study was funded by Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions, formerly the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, as part of the Preterm Birth and Healthy Outcomes Team Interdisciplinary Team Grant.

Some parents even provide alcohol for their children. One study from 2005 showed that twenty six percent of adults think underage drinking is okay if an adult is present. Those that are for lowering the drinking age generally argue that the moderate consumption of alcohol frequently as a complement to a meal or drink with friends is preferable to and healthier than the binge drinking habits more often associated with dry countries such as the United States. Furthermore, \n\n observed 107 female university students in order to study the frequency and correlation of self-induced vomiting after consuming alcohol. Results showed that 59.8% of the participants who reported drinking alcohol also appeared to have engaged in self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption. Participants that reported self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption also reported more bulimia nervosa symptomatology. In Australia, a 2013 study surveyed 139 Australian women between the ages of 18 and 29 enrolled in an undergraduate degree at university. These women were asked to complete a survey regarding compensatory eating and behaviors in response to alcohol consumption to test for drunkorexia symptomatology. In the sample tested, 79% of participants demonstrated engaging in characterized drunkorexia behavior. Further analysis \n\n Alcohol can be a depressant which slows down some regions of the brain, like the prefrontal and temporal cortex, negatively affecting rationality and memory. The connection between the amount of alcohol intake, level of depressed mood, and how it affects the risks of experiencing consequences from alcoholism, were studied in a research done on college students. The study used 4 latent, distinct profiles of different alcohol intake and level of depression; Mild or Moderate Depression, and Heavy or Severe Drinkers. Results showed that the level of depression as an emotion negatively affected the amount of risky behavior and consequence from drinking, while having an inverse relationship with protective behavioral strategies, which are behavioral actions taken by oneself for protection from the relative harm of alcohol intake. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional psychology.

These findings highlight the complexity of understanding preterm birth and the need for an interdisciplinary approach, a strategy embraced by the Preterm Birth International Collaborative (PREBIC) in recently published guidelines for preterm birth research . Despite our growing awareness that infection, inflammation, stress and other risk factors contribute to the pathophysiology of preterm birth, predicting which women will deliver preterm remains an ongoing challenge. Many biomarkers for preterm birth have been suggested and explored such as fetal fibronectin [27, 28], maternal corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) , and cervical length  however all have had limitations such as low positive predictive values, low sensitivity or poor specificity  in addition to high inter-individual variability, which limit their translation into clinical settings. The evidence also suggests that an interdisciplinary approach is required to understand preterm birth pathophysiology. To examine the relative impact of genes and environment on the risk of preterm birth by exploring the interactions between medical history, gene expression patterns and environmental variables. Women that consent to the release of their information are subsequently contacted by telephone to determine eligibility, inform them about the study and invite them to participate. Questionnaires were developed to address the objectives of the All Our Babies Cohort Study and included input from academics, stakeholders and decision makers. These questionnaires (available on request) assess demographics, pregnancy history, service utilization, nutrition and exercise practices, mental health, social support, lifestyle and life history, and breastfeeding experiences through questions designed for this study as well as the following validated instruments: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale , Spielberger State Anxiety Scale , MOS Social Support Scale , Perceived Stress Scale , T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk , Parenting Morale Index , the Parental Expectations Scale for parenting self-efficacy , and the MCH Feeding Scale (personal communication, M. Ramsay, Feeding Problem Questionnaire 2003). The questionnaires were pilot tested prior to study commencement and revised for unclear wording. The Alberta Perinatal Health (APH) database is an Alberta-based database that contains prenatal maternal and birth outcome information from all recorded births in the province. This enables the questionnaire data to be linked to their APH administrative data about birth outcomes, and to examine medical records to verify circumstances associated with preterm birth. All women who receive prenatal viral serology phlebotomy by Calgary Laboratory Service and consent to be contacted by researchers are contacted via telephone. Transcriptomic profiles from maternal blood samples collected at 18-22 weeks and 28-32 weeks of pregnancy will be compared between two groups (women who deliver at term and women who deliver preterm) for patterns predictive of preterm birth. Health service utilization, maternal social support, psychosocial well-being, mental health, breastfeeding and parenting support at four months postpartum will be compared between term and preterm deliveries. The relative contribution of the environmental risk and the genetic risk will be compared between term and preterm deliveries. Therefore, with a preterm birth rate of 9.1% in Alberta, an anticipated miscarriage rate of 5% and an anticipated loss to follow-up rate of 15% based on experience with other Alberta based cohorts , 2200 women will be enrolled in the All Our Babies Cohort Study. The impact of access to routine prenatal care and health services on maternal variables at four months postpartum will be compared among the entire cohort. Although the sample size calculations for the All Our Babies Cohort Study were derived for the microarray analysis, the sample size of 1800 women is adequate to describe differences between groups with respect to health service utilization, maternal social support, psychosocial well-being, mental health, breastfeeding and parenting support using logistic regression [45–47]. For participants unable or unwilling to travel to the laboratory clinic, the research team will send a certified mobile phlebotomist to the women's home or other neutral location of her choice for the blood collections. Women and their health care providers therefore do not need to do anything at the time of delivery for the study. Based on women's consent to participate in follow-up studies of 97% and with dedicated retention strategies, it is anticipated that no more than 10% of study participants will be lost to follow-up into the preschool years. Cases and controls will be 'loosely matched' such that each group has a similar distribution of maternal ages, prepregnancy body mass indexes and smoking status. Participant characteristics will be assessed and compared to the pregnant and parenting population in the province of Alberta and nationwide across Canada. There are also no direct medical benefits to the participants nor their infants for participating in the All Our Babies Cohort Study. The rate of preterm birth is on the rise in the developed world. Alberta has the highest provincial preterm birth rate in Canada, the causes of which remain unexplained. The All Our Babies Cohort Study is strategically situated to examine the environmental, medical and genetic factors impacting preterm birth in Alberta and seeks to exploit their predictive properties for future clinical screening of all pregnant women. Should gene expression patterns predictive of spontaneous preterm birth be elucidated or gene-environment interactions protective against or synergistic for a spontaneous preterm birth outcome be discovered, the detailed phenotypic information will inform validation endeavors. In addition, this study will improve our understanding of how social support and social services impact spontaneous preterm birth in Calgary. The delivery of health services in the province of Alberta is currently undergoing reorganization making the assessment of women's needs during pregnancy very timely to inform service and program development and change of healthcare policies. The comprehensive questionnaire data obtained from participants in the All Our Babies Cohort Study combined with data from medical records provides a concise record of local health practices and the impact of practice on maternal-fetal and newborn health. The results of the study will provide the opportunity to describe the mental health and psychosocial characteristics of mothers living in Calgary as well as estimates of the impact of these characteristics on birth and the parenting experience. The All Our Babies Cohort Study will also record women's prenatal care experience in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing prenatal care. In addition, the information will enable evaluation of the relationships between access to routine prenatal care on postpartum depression, parenting morale, anxiety, stress, social support, lifestyle choices such as smoking, drug use and alcohol consumption, breastfeeding initiation, duration and challenges and postpartum use of health care services. Participants are involved in the study for approximately one year's time. It is anticipated that sample collections will be completed by spring 2011, all participants will have delivered their infant(s) by summer 2011 and data collection will be completed by fall 2011. Participants have been asked about their interest in participating in follow-up studies, potentially allowing for further research on early determinants of child and adult health outcomes. Complex preterm phenotypes are determined by genetic, physiological and environmental factors interacting at the cellular, organ, systemic, and lifestyle levels. The All Our Babies Cohort Study is gathering extensive detailed data on the gene expression profiles, medical history, lifestyle, demographics, physical and mental well-being, and neighbourhoods of the participants to predict preterm birth in asymptomatic women. The research team, community laboratory service and provincial health service provider are intimately partnered to facilitate multiple aspects of the study process. Recruitment, biological sample collection, and accessing medical record data are made possible by the academic-clinical collaborations that are the foundation of the All Our Babies Cohort Study. This study was funded by Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions, formerly the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, as part of the Preterm Birth and Healthy Outcomes Team Interdisciplinary Team Grant. We would like to gratefully acknowledge the departments of Calgary Laboratory Service for their support of recruitment, sample collection, and specimen biobanking; the departments of Alberta Health Services for their support of sample and data collection; the All Our Babies Cohort Study Research Assistant Team for their dedication and enthusiasm to maintaining participant involvement in the study; and the participants who graciously give their time to contribute to our study. a household where drinking is common. Some parents even provide alcohol for their children. One study from 2005 showed that twenty six percent of adults think underage drinking is okay if an adult is present. Those that are for lowering the drinking age generally argue that the moderate consumption of alcohol frequently as a complement to a meal or drink with friends is preferable to and healthier than the binge drinking habits more often associated with dry countries such as the United States. Furthermore, \n\n observed 107 female university students in order to study the frequency and correlation of self-induced vomiting after consuming alcohol. Results showed that 59.8% of the participants who reported drinking alcohol also appeared to have engaged in self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption. Participants that reported self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption also reported more bulimia nervosa symptomatology. In Australia, a 2013 study surveyed 139 Australian women between the ages of 18 and 29 enrolled in an undergraduate degree at university. These women were asked to complete a survey regarding compensatory eating and behaviors in response to alcohol consumption to test for drunkorexia symptomatology. In the sample tested, 79% of participants demonstrated engaging in characterized drunkorexia behavior. Further analysis \n\n Alcohol can be a depressant which slows down some regions of the brain, like the prefrontal and temporal cortex, negatively affecting rationality and memory. The connection between the amount of alcohol intake, level of depressed mood, and how it affects the risks of experiencing consequences from alcoholism, were studied in a research done on college students. The study used 4 latent, distinct profiles of different alcohol intake and level of depression; Mild or Moderate Depression, and Heavy or Severe Drinkers. Results showed that the level of depression as an emotion negatively affected the amount of risky behavior and consequence from drinking, while having an inverse relationship with protective behavioral strategies, which are behavioral actions taken by oneself for protection from the relative harm of alcohol intake. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking.\n\n"

Patients, the statistician, and the conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The patients, the statistician, and conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. With three groups and thereby multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases . To limit the family-wise error rate to 0.05, considering two main comparisons and one exploratory comparison, we adjusted the significance level for the primary outcome to α = 0.025 (0.05/2) for each of the three comparisons . With an acceptable risk of type II error of 0.10, we estimated the necessary sample size. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed mean difference in the PF (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of 55 mmHg and a standard deviation (SD) of 50 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion , and an assumed mean difference in the PF ratio of 150 mmHg and a SD of 110 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion . We therefore estimated that we would need three groups of 30 patients to preserve power in the complete case analysis in case of eventual patient dropouts or loss to follow-up. To calculate a hypothetical sample size for this comparison we set a value for the anticipated mean difference and SD to 30 mmHg and 30 mmHg, respectively. With a significance level for the primary outcome still being α = 0.025 and the power set to 90%, we calculated the sample size for this comparison to be 26 patients in each group. We will use preoperative lung function as a stratification variable. The outcomes will be defined as primary, secondary, and exploratory. The exploratory outcome measures will be reported in a separate publication(s). Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification stage II or worse. If the result of the primary outcome is not statistically significant, the conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the interventions. The results on all other types of outcomes will be reported for hypothesis-generating purposes. However, we will inspect the confidence interval (CI) to asses if the CI for the group difference contains values of importance, so that we cannot rule out interesting differences. The primary analysis will include a modified intention-to-treat population, which is defined as all randomized patients, except patients who did not receive CPB-dependent cardiac surgery . A secondary analysis will include the per-protocol population excluding patients with major protocol violations defined as: 1) patients who were randomized to an intervention but did not receive any intervention; and 2) patients who received an incorrect intervention. The dependent variable will be the oxygenation index measured six times and the covariates will be the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD), design (age, FEV1, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the patient’s baseline oxygenation index measured after anaesthetic induction) and intervention-group variable. The first analysis will be on the patients who met the inclusion criteria but did not meet the exclusion criteria, with adjustment for the stratification variable. The second analysis will be an analysis adjusted for both the stratification variable and the design variables . The conclusions of the trial will be based on the primary analysis. Linear mixed-effects model analysis of longitudinal data will be used to analyze the primary outcome. The linear mixed-effects model approach handles missing data appropriately and we will therefore not use multiple imputation or other methods to handle missing data in regard to the primary outcome . If data missingness for the remaining outcomes represent less than 5% (five patients), a complete case analysis without input of missing values will be performed. If missing data are more than 5%, a blinded statistician will assess whether missing data are completely at random and may be ruled out based on a rational assessment of the pattern of missing data , and Little’s test will be used if doubt remains . If it is concluded that missing data are not completely at random, multiple imputation using chained equations [14, 15] will be performed by creating 10 input data sets under the assumption of that the missing data are at random [16, 17]. We will use the stratification-, design-, and intervention-variables, as well as other known predictive outcomes, in the multiple imputation to estimate the missing values. If multiple imputation is used, then the primary result of the trial will be based on these data. The unadjusted, non-imputed analysis will also be made available. If multiple imputation is used, we use a best-worst worst-best case scenario as a supplement and a form of sensitivity analysis to assess the potential range of impact of the missing data for the trial results. In the ‘best-worst’ case scenario, it is assumed that all patients lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a beneficial outcome (have survived, had no serious adverse events, and so forth), and all those with missing outcomes in the control group have had a harmful outcome (have not survived, have had a serious adverse event, and so forth). Conversely, in the ‘worst-best’ case scenario, it is assumed that all patients who were lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a harmful outcome, and that all those lost to follow-up in the control group have had a beneficial outcome. When continuous outcomes are used, a ‘beneficial outcome’ will be defined as the group mean plus two standard deviation (SD) of the group mean, and a ‘harmful outcome’ will be defined as the group mean minus two SD of the group mean. We will assess the validity of the trial results according to the five-point procedure as suggested by Jakobsen et al. This procedure will include the mentioned adjustments of thresholds for significance according to the number of primary outcome comparisons. We will use a P value threshold for significance of 0.025 (0.05/2 because two primary outcome comparisons are used) and a Bayes factor threshold for significance of 0.1 . The flow of trial patients will be displayed in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram (see Figure 1) . The number of screened patients who fulfilled trial inclusion criteria, and the number included in the primary and secondary analyses, as well as all reasons for exclusions in primary and secondary analyses will be reported. The differences between the groups on the primary outcome will be tested with a mixed-effects model with time as a continuous variable. This measurement will be included in the analysis as a covariate. Since the time points for measurement of the oxygenation index do not have equidistant time intervals, we will also carry out a sensitivity analysis with time as an ordinal variable where the time intervals are equal. The mixed-effects model results will be presented as P values and 95% CI. In the mixed-effects model we will use both an ‘unstructured' and a '1. order autoregressive' covariance matrix and choose the matrix resulting in the lowest Bayesian information criterion. To assess, if the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals, standardized residuals, and random effects. If the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are clearly violated then we will use a generalized estimation equation for the analysis. Secondly we will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the three groups at the 24 hours after anaesthetic induction time point. To assess whether the assumptions for the ANCOVA are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals and residuals versus fitted values. ANCOVA results will be presented as P values, 95% CI, and unadjusted mean differences. We will test the underlying assumptions for the logistic regression by plotting Pearson residuals against both fitted values and against each continuous variable. All other secondary outcomes will be analyzed as count variables using the van Elteren test . Count data results will be presented as mean and median differences using bootstrapping to show 95% CI. For the secondary outcomes we will calculate the P value and divide the statistical significance into three groups: 1) P >0.05: not statistically significant; 2) P = 0.01 to 0.05: dubious statistically significance; and 3) P <0.01: statistically significant. We will present the description of baseline characteristics by intervention group. Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages calculated according to the number of patients for whom data are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be stated. Continuous variables will be summarized using standard measures of central tendency and dispersion, using either mean ± SD for data with normal distribution, or median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed data. Tests for interaction between the intervention and each stratification and design variables used to identify subgroups will be exploratory. The first figure will be a CONSORT flow chart as specified in Figure 1. Data for the second figure will be the complete cases, and therefore there is an underlying assumption that the data is missing completely at random; interpretation of the figure should therefore be with precaution. The third figure will be a Kaplan-Meier plot of survival in the three groups during the total trial period (15 months). The fourth figure will be a forest plot of intervention effects stratified for the subgroups defined by the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD) and design variables: age dichotomized around the median, FEV1 dichotomized around the median, left ventricular ejection fraction dichotomized around the median, and the patient’s baseline oxygenation index dichotomized around the median. The first table will be the baseline characteristics of the modified intention-to-treat population, the second table will be the prevalence of the binary and continuous outcome measures adjusted for the stratification variable, and the third table will be the results of the adjusted (stratification and design variables) complete case and multiple imputation analyses, with a 95% CI and exact P values in tabular form. Some of the secondary outcome measures are not completed due to lack in financial support and collaborates not able to fulfill assignments. Of the pre-specified results from the trial, we plan to report the primary and secondary outcome measures in the main publication. We will use a pragmatic adjustment for multiplicity described in the following. The primary conclusion of the trial will be based on the result of the primary outcome and if this result lacks statistically significance, the overall conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the compared interventions. We will analyze data in accordance to the modified intention-to-treat principle and, if necessary, use data sets generated by multiple imputations, and a best-worst/worst-best case scenario to assess the potential impact of the missing data on the results. Our methodological strength is the predefined methodology of the design and statistical analysis plan . Also, we take the multiplicity problem into account and use validated analytical methods, including systematic tests, for underlying assumptions. We strengthen our results by use of multiple imputations for missing data and the best-worst/worst-best case scenario to show range of the results’ uncertainty. The statistical analysis plan has limitations. The results on the primary outcome are analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model which can be difficult to interpret with analytical complexity and may be difficult to test for underlying assumption. Further, the sample size estimation was based on a slightly different outcome measure, the PF ratio (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen), which does not include airway pressure as for the oxygenation index, and the estimated sample size does not necessarily comply with what is needed in the mixed-effects model. We use a number of surrogate outcome measures with questionable clinical relevance, and even though we have classified the trial as a pilot trial, there is a risk that the trial via valid statistical methodology will indicate that the assessed interventions are beneficial, which could be misleading because of the unestablished clinical relevance of the surrogate outcome measures. Finally, we use multiple imputation to handle missing data on the remaining outcome measures and it cannot be ruled out that data missing are not at random and multiple imputation may produce biased results. This article describes the principles of statistical analyses used in the PP-Trial for the primary publication of the main outcome measures in order to minimize risk of data-driven results and outcome reporting bias.

Data sources Cochrane register of controlled trials, Cochrane Wounds Group specialised trials register, Medline (1950-2007), Embase, and CINAHL bibliographic databases, without language restrictions. Data extraction Primary outcomes were time (days) to healing, surgical site infection, and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and assessed for quality. Meta-analyses used fixed and random effects models, dichotomous data were reported as relative risks or Peto odds ratios and continuous data are given as mean differences; all with 95% confidence intervals. Variations in current practice reflect the literature, which describes a wide spectrum in patient outcomes for different open and closed surgical techniques. To inquire about unpublished data we contacted authors of included studies. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. We did not assess blinding after allocation as it was not possible to blind patients, surgeons, or assessors to the intervention. We assessed several criteria: randomisation—whether the sequence was truly random (for example, computer generated, random number tables, coin toss); concealment of allocation—whether a randomisation method described would not allow the investigator or participant to know or influence the intervention group before an eligible participant was entered (allocation concealed); and completeness of follow-up—whether withdrawals were described and reported by treatment group (completeness of follow-up recorded; >80% cut-off). We categorised risk of bias as low (all criteria met), moderate (one or more criteria met), or high (no criteria met). We defined interventions as closed if primary closure of the skin edges was achieved. We analysed quantitative data using RevMan. For each outcome we calculated summary estimates of treatment effect (95% confidence intervals) for each comparison. We calculated mean differences for continuous data, and relative risk or Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Peto odds ratio when event rates were low. We did not do a sensitivity analysis because of the small numbers of included trials. We assessed clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity was tested using the χ2 test and the I2 statistic.3 Fixed effects models were used unless we found significant evidence of statistical heterogeneity or clinical diversity. When diversity or result format precluded meta-analysis, we present the results in a tabular format. Sample sizes in the trials ranged from 33 to 200 participants (total 1573; table 1⇓). Only two studies adequately fulfilled all methodological requirements and were considered as having low risk of bias.w14 w17 Four studies were considered to be at high risk of bias,w5 w6 w12 w19 and the remaining trials were graded as moderate (table 2⇓). A Peto odds ratio was used for the comparison of midline closure versus off-midline closure owing to the low event rate. Of five trials reporting time to return to work (563 participants); three used midline closurew2 w4 w5 and two off-midline closure.w1 w13 Patients undergoing excision with open healing took longer to return to work than those having closed operations regardless of closure method (open v closed (all) mean difference 10.48 days, 5.75 to 15.21; fig 6⇓), midline closure (8.56 days, 2.97 to 14.15; fig 6⇓), or off-midline closure (15.30 days, 6.44 to 24.16; fig 6⇓). Numerous different complications were reported by the trials, including maceration, primary failure, wound dehiscence, haematoma, early suture removal, and flap oedema.w1 w2 w4 w6-w8 w13 w15 w17 w19 Owing to heterogeneity of outcomes and reporting of outcomes (for example, number of events and number of patients with events), a random effects model was selected. A small but statistically significant preference was shown for off-midline closure than for midline closure, where satisfaction was measured using a 0-10 visual analogue scale in the single study that measured this outcome.w15 A mean difference of one point on a visual analogue scale is, however, unlikely to be translated into a meaningful clinical difference (7.4 (SD 1.4) v 6.5 (SD 1.7) visual analogue scale; P<0.001). A random effects model was used, as significant statistical heterogeneity was shown within the results (I2=98.2%). Data were pooled as the high statistical heterogeneity was caused by the result of one study,w1 where both operations were carried out on a day case basis compared with other studies where samples were inpatients. A random effects model was used as there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I2=72.3%). A clear benefit was, however, found with off-midline closure compared with midline closure. This is an area worthy of further evaluation. This, as in all meta-analyses, represents a compromise, which has to be reached to provide meaningful comparison. Study groups contain variable interventions, however, and the optimal specific technique for differing severities of disease cannot be inferred from the data presented here. We did not undertake formal assessment for publication bias. The methodological quality of the studies was disappointing; most trials were small and at risk of failing to detect clinically relevant differences as statistically significant. Other methodological flaws such as poor randomisation techniques and inadequate follow-up further limit the interpretation of findings. Standardisation was lacking in reporting of outcomes, length of trial, and proportion of recruited sample followed up; many trials failed to accurately record or present this information. Finally, studies should incorporate health economic techniques to estimate associated costs and benefits of different treatment options.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev2007;(4):CD006213.Doi:10.1002/14651858.CDoo6213.pub 2. In the field of epidemiology, several basic tools of measurement are used to assess and analyze health-related data. These measurement tools include rates, ratios, and proportions. Rates are commonly used in epidemiology to determine the frequency of a particular event, such as the occurrence of a disease or a health condition, in a specific population over a given period. Rates are calculated by dividing the number of events by the population size and are usually presented as a rate per unit of time (e.g., cases per 1,000 individuals per year). Ratios are another important tool in epidemiology. They involve comparing two quantities or numbers, such as the ratio of the number of cases in one group to the number of cases in another group. Ratios are particularly useful when comparing disease occurrence or health outcomes between different populations or time points. Proportions are also commonly used in epidemiology and represent the fraction of a population or group that has a specific characteristic or outcome. Proportions are often expressed as percentages, which make them easier to understand and interpret. These basic tools of measurement, including rates, ratios, and proportions, are fundamental to epidemiological research. They help in assessing the magnitude and impact of disease, identifying patterns, and monitoring health outcomes within populations. By using these measurement tools, epidemiologists can gain valuable insights into the distribution and determinants of diseases, which is crucial for public health planning and intervention strategies. or cross tabulations, or from observations of quantitative data grouped within given intervals. Often, purely categorical data are summarised in the form of a contingency table. However, particularly when considering data analysis, it is common to use the term \"categorical data\" to apply to data sets that, while containing some categorical variables, may also contain non-categorical variables. A categorical variable that can take on exactly two values is termed a binary variable or a dichotomous variable; an important special case is the Bernoulli variable. Categorical variables with more than two possible values are called polytomous variables; categorical variables are often assumed to be polytomous unless otherwise specified. Discretization is treating continuous data as if it were categorical. Dichotomization is treating continuous data or polytomous variables as if they were binary variables. Regression analysis often treats category membership with one or more quantitative dummy variables. Since the model outcomes cannot be measured directly, the only available technical validation was corroboration. The VLDL metabolic ratios outperformed each of the classical diagnostics separately; they also added power of distinction when included in a multivariate logistic regression model on top of the classical diagnostics. Although such a profile contains much information, it has not led to a single diagnostic value that is easily applicable. One example of interpreting this detailed data is the pooling of all LDL particles, and reporting an 'LDL particle number'. Model development and calibration are necessary to overcome previously identified shortcomings (see model development below). In this study we address two questions. Second, whether Particle Profiler- based ratios of VLDL metabolic processes derived from pooled lipoprotein flux data indicate relevant differences between dyslipidemic and normolipidemic subjects. The mathematical functions describing liver uptake and lipolysis needed further development for two reasons. The deviation was mainly due to the uptake fluxes, suggesting that the mathematical functions used to model uptake processes were suboptimal. Secondly, a parameter identifiability analysis, using the covariance matrix produced by the parameter fitting routine (data not shown), showed that detailed lipoprotein profiles, in contrast to lipoprotein kinetics data, do not contain enough information to fit the six parameters in the original model. We expect that this necessary simplification wil reduce model performance, but by smart reduction and subsequent calibration we attempt to limit the performance reduction. The probability that a particle is taken up or lipolyzed depends on the size of the particle, with larger particles having a greater probability of being taken up instead of lipolyzed . Where all symbols have the same meaning as before, and s u, liver is a liver uptake constant, that helps to determine the shape of the uptake function. The Weibull function normally has two shape parameters, but the available data do not contain enough information to fit both. Therefore we gave s u, liver a constant value that does not vary between patients, but that we optimize under 'model calibration'. The model equations contain parameters that are allowed to assume different values for different patients and model constants that are fixed to the same value for all patients. The model constants contain the biological information that, for instance, allows the model to distinguish hepatic lipolysis from extrahepatic lipolysis. Therefore, it is very important that these constants have the correct values. The first two constants are new to the model, the last two were already present in the first version , but are now given new values. To estimate the model constants, one needs data from subjects in which particular process stands out clearly. Below, we first describe what data we used to estimate specific constants, and in continuation we describe how the constants were estimated. Subjects with the ApoE 2/2 isoform are known to have impaired uptake of large VLDL and chylomicron particles . Therefore, the data from subjects with the ApoE 2/2 phenotype were useful for estimating two model constants related to LPL: σ a, lpl and da, lpl min. We allowed the 'HL peak size' (d hl, peak ) parameter to be optimized for each individual apoE 2/2 subject, which is otherwise constant for all subjects. Parameter identifiability was inspected using the covariance matrix produced by the fitting routine. In this way, the model parameters were estimated per individual, while the model constants were estimated for the whole population, using a group of patients judged most suited for the determination of that constant. The order of fitting and the type of subjects, discussed above, were chosen in such a way that the constants that had not yet been fitted exerted minimal influence on the constant being fitted. With the new model equation and settings, we examined whether the results are comparible to those in our first paper . were fitted with the new model and the results were compared with those from the first model implementation . In the first implementation, the model reproduced a shift in 'LDL peak size', which was independently measured. The model analysis also identified credible changes in relevant biological processes between groups with differing 'LDL peak size'. Since the models are different and the new model has one free parameter less, which in general leads to less optimal model performance, we did not expect an exact match between the model results. The model with optimized constants and one free parameter less than in the first implementation  reproduced the data from Packard et al. The overall fit error, defined in , was 7.3% ± 3.6% in this study compared to a 7.2% ± 4.5% error in our first paper. In  the model calculated a difference in LDL size of 4.2 nm between subjects with phenotype 'A' (large LDL particles) versus phenotype ' B' (small LDL particles). The latter are shown in Table 2. For particle size differences between phenotypes were found for LDL and IDL, and for the new implementation an additional difference in VLDL1 particle diameter was found. So all in all we have carried out a necessary simplification of the model, while keeping the overall model performance stable. Only those processes that show a significant difference (p < 0.1) using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test are included. Because these quantities cannot be measured directly, the best way of validating the model is through corroboration. We inspected whether the model was able to fit data from all these studies well. If successful, this indicates that the biology incorporated in the model in the form of mathematical equations is adequate to describe the measured experimental data, or in other words that the model is consistent with reality. The highest errors were found when analyzing data from Demant et al. We consider the deviation in this single study of small relevance, because it occurs not only in the diseased subjects, but also in the controls. Normolipidemic controls do not give problems in any other study. Without these subjects the average fit error was 8.8% ± 5.0%. Graphical representation of the VLDL performance diagnostic. The information from these ratios can be summarized in a single statistic taking the mean of these two ratios, which can be visualized as a projection on the identity line. These are k u , l i v e r V L D L ¯ J p , V L D L , k l V L D L ¯ J p , V L D L , and VLDL performance, whose mathematical definition can be found below. A schematic introduction can be found in Figure 2. Where d i , j r represents the radius of the subclass with average diameter d i, j . To show in a single value how efficiently produced VLDL particles are metabolized, we introduce the 'VLDL performance' diagnostic, which is the average of the previous two ratios. Both ratios and VLDL performance have the dimension volume * particles -1 . Figure 2 graphically shows how VLDL performance and the two ratios are related, and how different disturbances in VLDL metabolism affect VLDL performance. Our pool of dyslipidemic subjects was defined as all the subjects that were considered to be 'dislipidemic' in each study. Subjects for which the measured particle influx and efflux differed more than 10% in one class (LDL, IDL, VLDL1 or VLDL2) were judged not to be at steady state and excluded from the dataset. A summary of the data used for the analysis can be found in Table 3. The dyslipidemic state of the selected patients is always very clearly distinguishable from the normolipidemic state, so that an effect can be observed with a small number of patients. Normolipidemic controls: apoE 3/3 subjects. Subject groups used for normolipidemia, dyslipidemia, and genetic disorders. If subjects needed to be excluded from a group because of a lack of steady state in the data (in- and efflux balance), individual subjects are mentioned. We tested whether particle Profiler-derived VLDL performance was different for normolipidemic versus dyslipidemic subjects. The parameters we introduce are completely novel; there is no similar diagnostic method that we can compare them to. The differences with standard diagnostics were expressed as the ability to correctly predict the known normolipidemic or dyslipidemic state from the diagnostic parameters. The test consisted of two phases: first the predictive power of each diagnostic separately, then the predictive power of multivariate models. For the multivariate models we performed logistic regression, we subsequently added LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL performance as predictor variables. The diagnostic accuracy was quantified using ROC curves . We used both the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Partial Area Under the Curve statistics (pAUC - for false positive rates < 0.2)  to quantify the predictive power of each separate diagnostic and of each multivariate regression model. Figure 3a shows ROC curves that describe how well LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL performance distinguished normolipidemic from dyslipidemic subjects. Figure 3b shows ROC curves of multivariate regression models that successively incorporate these diagnostics for making the same distinction together. Table 4 shows the partial area-under-the-curve (pAUC) and area-under-the-curve AUC values, indicating diagnostic power for dyslipidemia, for each of the regression models. The table shows that VLDL performance distinguished normolipidemics better from dyslipidemics than the routine clinical chemistry parameters. Also, VLDL performance improved the distinction when used in combination with LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. When accepting no false positives, the model including VLDL performance had a 91% sensitivity for correctly identifying dyslipidemic subjects, versus a 67% sensitivity when using only triglycerides, HDLc and LDLc. Therefore, VLDL performance had additional value for distinguishing dyslipidemic from normolipidemic subjects compared to standard diagnostics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for dyslipidemia. These curves indicate how well a) single diagnostics and b) multivariate regression models distinguish dyslipidemic subjects from normolipidemic subjects. The models in b) subsequently include LDLc, HDLc, TG, and VLDL performance in cumulative fashion. The ROC curve indicates with what sensitivity various diagnostics can identify dyslipidemic subjects, when varying the acceptable false-positive rate. An ROC curve further away from the 1-1 identity line indicates a better diagnostic. For example, when not accepting false positives, the regression model including LDLc, HDLc and TG has a sensitivity of 66% (0.66), while additionally including the VLDL performance diagnostic results in a sensitivity of 91% (0.91). Partial area under the curve (pAUC) and area under the curve (AUC) calculated from ROC curves of various diagnostics and combinations of diagnostics for distinguishing dyslipidemic subjects from normolipidemic subjects. Both pAUC and AUC are a measure of how well each diagnostic predicts the dyslipidemic status, with the difference that the pAUC only takes into account those predictions for which the false positive rate is smaller than 0.2, while the AUC takes into account all possible false positive rates. Next, we examined the average value of our VLDL-related diagnostic parameters for each of the studied subgroups. This comparison included subject groups for which no standard clinical chemistry parameters were available (normolipidemic subjects from [17–22]) and subject groups with specific genetic disorders. The figure clearly indicates that the normolipidemic groups (green and light-green lines) had a higher VLDL performance (projection onto the identity line) than dyslipidemic groups. The average VLDL performance of various subject groups. Green lines with round ends are normolipidemic subject groups. Groups indicated with darker green were used for the ROC curve in figure 3, those indicated with light green were not. Red lines with crosses represent dyslipidemic subject groups used for the ROC curve. Blue lines with triangles indicate subject groups with specific genetic variant. A diagnostic's clinical usefulness increases if there are treatment options when the diagnostic indicates illness. Therefore, we investigated how our VLDL-related diagnostic parameters respond to treatment. had too few subjects to distinguish this effect. VLDL performance response to treatment. Average VLDL performance response (on identity line) to Atorvastatin, Simvastatin and Fenofibrate treatment in mixed hyperlipidemic patients [24, 25]. In continuation, for calibrating the model constants, we used published data from LPL deficient, apoE 3/3 and apoE 2/2 subjects. , in which the overall error was comparable to that found in the first model implementation , while the new implementation had a smaller standard deviation of the error. It is encouraging that with fewer free parameters the newly optimized model had an approximately equal fit error. The smaller standard deviation of the fit error indicates that the three subjects for which the uptake flux was not fitted well in the initial implementation were fitted better in the current implementation. In our first paper, we compared the modeled LDL peak size between groups with measured differences in LDL peak size . However, we still detect an LDL peak size difference between groups, although with less significance than before. This last change is likely to be a consequence of the model calibration performed with data from genetically deficient subjects. Overall, we have carried out a necessary simplification of the model, while keeping the model performance stable. The only available option for the technical model validation was corroborating the model, since the model outcomes cannot be measured directly. The VLDL performance diagnostic was able to distinguish normolipidemic from dyslipidemic subjects. These results show that VLDL performance distinguished between normolipidemic and dyslipidemic subjects more clearly than standard clinical chemistry parameters. Subjects with genetic deficiencies showed up at the expected places in the between-group comparison. In order to improve its performance we specified a reparametrisation, specific for the data type used in this paper. This specification of parameters may lead to problems in the fitting routine in specific cases, when the boundary values of processes are reached. Therefore, during the parameter conversion process from fitted parameters to parameters for model calculation, the following fitted parameters were dynamically set to their boundary value. This procedure means that a parameter is only set to its boundary value if necessary, otherwise it is fitted normally. The size range of each size class are shown in Table 5. The size range of each size class has been estimated as shown in this table, modified from . This adjustment is specific for the type of data used. Data and model predictions were divided by the scaling factors shown in this table. We would like to thank Rajasekhar Ramakrishnan and Sabine Bijlsma for expert statistical advice.

Patients, the statistician, and the conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. The patients, the statistician, and conclusion drawers are blinded to intervention allocation. With three groups and thereby multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases . To limit the family-wise error rate to 0.05, considering two main comparisons and one exploratory comparison, we adjusted the significance level for the primary outcome to α = 0.025 (0.05/2) for each of the three comparisons . With an acceptable risk of type II error of 0.10, we estimated the necessary sample size. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed mean difference in the PF (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio of 55 mmHg and a standard deviation (SD) of 50 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus no pulmonary perfusion , and an assumed mean difference in the PF ratio of 150 mmHg and a SD of 110 mmHg for the comparison of pulmonary perfusion with Custodiol HTK solution versus no pulmonary perfusion . We therefore estimated that we would need three groups of 30 patients to preserve power in the complete case analysis in case of eventual patient dropouts or loss to follow-up. To calculate a hypothetical sample size for this comparison we set a value for the anticipated mean difference and SD to 30 mmHg and 30 mmHg, respectively. With a significance level for the primary outcome still being α = 0.025 and the power set to 90%, we calculated the sample size for this comparison to be 26 patients in each group. We will use preoperative lung function as a stratification variable. The outcomes will be defined as primary, secondary, and exploratory. The exploratory outcome measures will be reported in a separate publication(s). Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification stage II or worse. If the result of the primary outcome is not statistically significant, the conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the interventions. The results on all other types of outcomes will be reported for hypothesis-generating purposes. However, we will inspect the confidence interval (CI) to asses if the CI for the group difference contains values of importance, so that we cannot rule out interesting differences. The primary analysis will include a modified intention-to-treat population, which is defined as all randomized patients, except patients who did not receive CPB-dependent cardiac surgery . A secondary analysis will include the per-protocol population excluding patients with major protocol violations defined as: 1) patients who were randomized to an intervention but did not receive any intervention; and 2) patients who received an incorrect intervention. The dependent variable will be the oxygenation index measured six times and the covariates will be the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD), design (age, FEV1, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the patient’s baseline oxygenation index measured after anaesthetic induction) and intervention-group variable. The first analysis will be on the patients who met the inclusion criteria but did not meet the exclusion criteria, with adjustment for the stratification variable. The second analysis will be an analysis adjusted for both the stratification variable and the design variables . The conclusions of the trial will be based on the primary analysis. Linear mixed-effects model analysis of longitudinal data will be used to analyze the primary outcome. The linear mixed-effects model approach handles missing data appropriately and we will therefore not use multiple imputation or other methods to handle missing data in regard to the primary outcome . If data missingness for the remaining outcomes represent less than 5% (five patients), a complete case analysis without input of missing values will be performed. If missing data are more than 5%, a blinded statistician will assess whether missing data are completely at random and may be ruled out based on a rational assessment of the pattern of missing data , and Little’s test will be used if doubt remains . If it is concluded that missing data are not completely at random, multiple imputation using chained equations [14, 15] will be performed by creating 10 input data sets under the assumption of that the missing data are at random [16, 17]. We will use the stratification-, design-, and intervention-variables, as well as other known predictive outcomes, in the multiple imputation to estimate the missing values. If multiple imputation is used, then the primary result of the trial will be based on these data. The unadjusted, non-imputed analysis will also be made available. If multiple imputation is used, we use a best-worst worst-best case scenario as a supplement and a form of sensitivity analysis to assess the potential range of impact of the missing data for the trial results. In the ‘best-worst’ case scenario, it is assumed that all patients lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a beneficial outcome (have survived, had no serious adverse events, and so forth), and all those with missing outcomes in the control group have had a harmful outcome (have not survived, have had a serious adverse event, and so forth). Conversely, in the ‘worst-best’ case scenario, it is assumed that all patients who were lost to follow-up in the experimental group have had a harmful outcome, and that all those lost to follow-up in the control group have had a beneficial outcome. When continuous outcomes are used, a ‘beneficial outcome’ will be defined as the group mean plus two standard deviation (SD) of the group mean, and a ‘harmful outcome’ will be defined as the group mean minus two SD of the group mean. We will assess the validity of the trial results according to the five-point procedure as suggested by Jakobsen et al. This procedure will include the mentioned adjustments of thresholds for significance according to the number of primary outcome comparisons. We will use a P value threshold for significance of 0.025 (0.05/2 because two primary outcome comparisons are used) and a Bayes factor threshold for significance of 0.1 . The flow of trial patients will be displayed in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram (see Figure 1) . The number of screened patients who fulfilled trial inclusion criteria, and the number included in the primary and secondary analyses, as well as all reasons for exclusions in primary and secondary analyses will be reported. The differences between the groups on the primary outcome will be tested with a mixed-effects model with time as a continuous variable. This measurement will be included in the analysis as a covariate. Since the time points for measurement of the oxygenation index do not have equidistant time intervals, we will also carry out a sensitivity analysis with time as an ordinal variable where the time intervals are equal. The mixed-effects model results will be presented as P values and 95% CI. In the mixed-effects model we will use both an ‘unstructured' and a '1. order autoregressive' covariance matrix and choose the matrix resulting in the lowest Bayesian information criterion. To assess, if the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals, standardized residuals, and random effects. If the underlying assumptions behind the mixed-effects model analysis are clearly violated then we will use a generalized estimation equation for the analysis. Secondly we will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the three groups at the 24 hours after anaesthetic induction time point. To assess whether the assumptions for the ANCOVA are fulfilled, we will investigate normal quantile plots of residuals and residuals versus fitted values. ANCOVA results will be presented as P values, 95% CI, and unadjusted mean differences. We will test the underlying assumptions for the logistic regression by plotting Pearson residuals against both fitted values and against each continuous variable. All other secondary outcomes will be analyzed as count variables using the van Elteren test . Count data results will be presented as mean and median differences using bootstrapping to show 95% CI. For the secondary outcomes we will calculate the P value and divide the statistical significance into three groups: 1) P >0.05: not statistically significant; 2) P = 0.01 to 0.05: dubious statistically significance; and 3) P <0.01: statistically significant. We will present the description of baseline characteristics by intervention group. Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages calculated according to the number of patients for whom data are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be stated. Continuous variables will be summarized using standard measures of central tendency and dispersion, using either mean ± SD for data with normal distribution, or median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed data. Tests for interaction between the intervention and each stratification and design variables used to identify subgroups will be exploratory. The first figure will be a CONSORT flow chart as specified in Figure 1. Data for the second figure will be the complete cases, and therefore there is an underlying assumption that the data is missing completely at random; interpretation of the figure should therefore be with precaution. The third figure will be a Kaplan-Meier plot of survival in the three groups during the total trial period (15 months). The fourth figure will be a forest plot of intervention effects stratified for the subgroups defined by the stratification (mild COPD or moderate, severe, or very severe COPD) and design variables: age dichotomized around the median, FEV1 dichotomized around the median, left ventricular ejection fraction dichotomized around the median, and the patient’s baseline oxygenation index dichotomized around the median. The first table will be the baseline characteristics of the modified intention-to-treat population, the second table will be the prevalence of the binary and continuous outcome measures adjusted for the stratification variable, and the third table will be the results of the adjusted (stratification and design variables) complete case and multiple imputation analyses, with a 95% CI and exact P values in tabular form. Some of the secondary outcome measures are not completed due to lack in financial support and collaborates not able to fulfill assignments. Of the pre-specified results from the trial, we plan to report the primary and secondary outcome measures in the main publication. We will use a pragmatic adjustment for multiplicity described in the following. The primary conclusion of the trial will be based on the result of the primary outcome and if this result lacks statistically significance, the overall conclusion will be that there is no significant difference between the compared interventions. We will analyze data in accordance to the modified intention-to-treat principle and, if necessary, use data sets generated by multiple imputations, and a best-worst/worst-best case scenario to assess the potential impact of the missing data on the results. Our methodological strength is the predefined methodology of the design and statistical analysis plan . Also, we take the multiplicity problem into account and use validated analytical methods, including systematic tests, for underlying assumptions. We strengthen our results by use of multiple imputations for missing data and the best-worst/worst-best case scenario to show range of the results’ uncertainty. The statistical analysis plan has limitations. The results on the primary outcome are analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model which can be difficult to interpret with analytical complexity and may be difficult to test for underlying assumption. Further, the sample size estimation was based on a slightly different outcome measure, the PF ratio (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen), which does not include airway pressure as for the oxygenation index, and the estimated sample size does not necessarily comply with what is needed in the mixed-effects model. We use a number of surrogate outcome measures with questionable clinical relevance, and even though we have classified the trial as a pilot trial, there is a risk that the trial via valid statistical methodology will indicate that the assessed interventions are beneficial, which could be misleading because of the unestablished clinical relevance of the surrogate outcome measures. Finally, we use multiple imputation to handle missing data on the remaining outcome measures and it cannot be ruled out that data missing are not at random and multiple imputation may produce biased results. This article describes the principles of statistical analyses used in the PP-Trial for the primary publication of the main outcome measures in order to minimize risk of data-driven results and outcome reporting bias.

Data sources Cochrane register of controlled trials, Cochrane Wounds Group specialised trials register, Medline (1950-2007), Embase, and CINAHL bibliographic databases, without language restrictions. Data extraction Primary outcomes were time (days) to healing, surgical site infection, and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and assessed for quality. Meta-analyses used fixed and random effects models, dichotomous data were reported as relative risks or Peto odds ratios and continuous data are given as mean differences; all with 95% confidence intervals. Variations in current practice reflect the literature, which describes a wide spectrum in patient outcomes for different open and closed surgical techniques. To inquire about unpublished data we contacted authors of included studies. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work, other complications and morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and wound healing rate. We did not assess blinding after allocation as it was not possible to blind patients, surgeons, or assessors to the intervention. We assessed several criteria: randomisation—whether the sequence was truly random (for example, computer generated, random number tables, coin toss); concealment of allocation—whether a randomisation method described would not allow the investigator or participant to know or influence the intervention group before an eligible participant was entered (allocation concealed); and completeness of follow-up—whether withdrawals were described and reported by treatment group (completeness of follow-up recorded; >80% cut-off). We categorised risk of bias as low (all criteria met), moderate (one or more criteria met), or high (no criteria met). We defined interventions as closed if primary closure of the skin edges was achieved. We analysed quantitative data using RevMan. For each outcome we calculated summary estimates of treatment effect (95% confidence intervals) for each comparison. We calculated mean differences for continuous data, and relative risk or Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Peto odds ratio when event rates were low. We did not do a sensitivity analysis because of the small numbers of included trials. We assessed clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity was tested using the χ2 test and the I2 statistic.3 Fixed effects models were used unless we found significant evidence of statistical heterogeneity or clinical diversity. When diversity or result format precluded meta-analysis, we present the results in a tabular format. Sample sizes in the trials ranged from 33 to 200 participants (total 1573; table 1⇓). Only two studies adequately fulfilled all methodological requirements and were considered as having low risk of bias.w14 w17 Four studies were considered to be at high risk of bias,w5 w6 w12 w19 and the remaining trials were graded as moderate (table 2⇓). A Peto odds ratio was used for the comparison of midline closure versus off-midline closure owing to the low event rate. Of five trials reporting time to return to work (563 participants); three used midline closurew2 w4 w5 and two off-midline closure.w1 w13 Patients undergoing excision with open healing took longer to return to work than those having closed operations regardless of closure method (open v closed (all) mean difference 10.48 days, 5.75 to 15.21; fig 6⇓), midline closure (8.56 days, 2.97 to 14.15; fig 6⇓), or off-midline closure (15.30 days, 6.44 to 24.16; fig 6⇓). Numerous different complications were reported by the trials, including maceration, primary failure, wound dehiscence, haematoma, early suture removal, and flap oedema.w1 w2 w4 w6-w8 w13 w15 w17 w19 Owing to heterogeneity of outcomes and reporting of outcomes (for example, number of events and number of patients with events), a random effects model was selected. A small but statistically significant preference was shown for off-midline closure than for midline closure, where satisfaction was measured using a 0-10 visual analogue scale in the single study that measured this outcome.w15 A mean difference of one point on a visual analogue scale is, however, unlikely to be translated into a meaningful clinical difference (7.4 (SD 1.4) v 6.5 (SD 1.7) visual analogue scale; P<0.001). A random effects model was used, as significant statistical heterogeneity was shown within the results (I2=98.2%). Data were pooled as the high statistical heterogeneity was caused by the result of one study,w1 where both operations were carried out on a day case basis compared with other studies where samples were inpatients. A random effects model was used as there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I2=72.3%). A clear benefit was, however, found with off-midline closure compared with midline closure. This is an area worthy of further evaluation. This, as in all meta-analyses, represents a compromise, which has to be reached to provide meaningful comparison. Study groups contain variable interventions, however, and the optimal specific technique for differing severities of disease cannot be inferred from the data presented here. We did not undertake formal assessment for publication bias. The methodological quality of the studies was disappointing; most trials were small and at risk of failing to detect clinically relevant differences as statistically significant. Other methodological flaws such as poor randomisation techniques and inadequate follow-up further limit the interpretation of findings. Standardisation was lacking in reporting of outcomes, length of trial, and proportion of recruited sample followed up; many trials failed to accurately record or present this information. Finally, studies should incorporate health economic techniques to estimate associated costs and benefits of different treatment options.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev2007;(4):CD006213.Doi:10.1002/14651858.CDoo6213.pub 2. In the field of epidemiology, several basic tools of measurement are used to assess and analyze health-related data. These measurement tools include rates, ratios, and proportions. Rates are commonly used in epidemiology to determine the frequency of a particular event, such as the occurrence of a disease or a health condition, in a specific population over a given period. Rates are calculated by dividing the number of events by the population size and are usually presented as a rate per unit of time (e.g., cases per 1,000 individuals per year). Ratios are another important tool in epidemiology. They involve comparing two quantities or numbers, such as the ratio of the number of cases in one group to the number of cases in another group. Ratios are particularly useful when comparing disease occurrence or health outcomes between different populations or time points. Proportions are also commonly used in epidemiology and represent the fraction of a population or group that has a specific characteristic or outcome. Proportions are often expressed as percentages, which make them easier to understand and interpret. These basic tools of measurement, including rates, ratios, and proportions, are fundamental to epidemiological research. They help in assessing the magnitude and impact of disease, identifying patterns, and monitoring health outcomes within populations. By using these measurement tools, epidemiologists can gain valuable insights into the distribution and determinants of diseases, which is crucial for public health planning and intervention strategies. or cross tabulations, or from observations of quantitative data grouped within given intervals. Often, purely categorical data are summarised in the form of a contingency table. However, particularly when considering data analysis, it is common to use the term \"categorical data\" to apply to data sets that, while containing some categorical variables, may also contain non-categorical variables. A categorical variable that can take on exactly two values is termed a binary variable or a dichotomous variable; an important special case is the Bernoulli variable. Categorical variables with more than two possible values are called polytomous variables; categorical variables are often assumed to be polytomous unless otherwise specified. Discretization is treating continuous data as if it were categorical. Dichotomization is treating continuous data or polytomous variables as if they were binary variables. Regression analysis often treats category membership with one or more quantitative dummy variables. Since the model outcomes cannot be measured directly, the only available technical validation was corroboration. The VLDL metabolic ratios outperformed each of the classical diagnostics separately; they also added power of distinction when included in a multivariate logistic regression model on top of the classical diagnostics. Although such a profile contains much information, it has not led to a single diagnostic value that is easily applicable. One example of interpreting this detailed data is the pooling of all LDL particles, and reporting an 'LDL particle number'. Model development and calibration are necessary to overcome previously identified shortcomings (see model development below). In this study we address two questions. Second, whether Particle Profiler- based ratios of VLDL metabolic processes derived from pooled lipoprotein flux data indicate relevant differences between dyslipidemic and normolipidemic subjects. The mathematical functions describing liver uptake and lipolysis needed further development for two reasons. The deviation was mainly due to the uptake fluxes, suggesting that the mathematical functions used to model uptake processes were suboptimal. Secondly, a parameter identifiability analysis, using the covariance matrix produced by the parameter fitting routine (data not shown), showed that detailed lipoprotein profiles, in contrast to lipoprotein kinetics data, do not contain enough information to fit the six parameters in the original model. We expect that this necessary simplification wil reduce model performance, but by smart reduction and subsequent calibration we attempt to limit the performance reduction. The probability that a particle is taken up or lipolyzed depends on the size of the particle, with larger particles having a greater probability of being taken up instead of lipolyzed . Where all symbols have the same meaning as before, and s u, liver is a liver uptake constant, that helps to determine the shape of the uptake function. The Weibull function normally has two shape parameters, but the available data do not contain enough information to fit both. Therefore we gave s u, liver a constant value that does not vary between patients, but that we optimize under 'model calibration'. The model equations contain parameters that are allowed to assume different values for different patients and model constants that are fixed to the same value for all patients. The model constants contain the biological information that, for instance, allows the model to distinguish hepatic lipolysis from extrahepatic lipolysis. Therefore, it is very important that these constants have the correct values. The first two constants are new to the model, the last two were already present in the first version , but are now given new values. To estimate the model constants, one needs data from subjects in which particular process stands out clearly. Below, we first describe what data we used to estimate specific constants, and in continuation we describe how the constants were estimated. Subjects with the ApoE 2/2 isoform are known to have impaired uptake of large VLDL and chylomicron particles . Therefore, the data from subjects with the ApoE 2/2 phenotype were useful for estimating two model constants related to LPL: σ a, lpl and da, lpl min. We allowed the 'HL peak size' (d hl, peak ) parameter to be optimized for each individual apoE 2/2 subject, which is otherwise constant for all subjects. Parameter identifiability was inspected using the covariance matrix produced by the fitting routine. In this way, the model parameters were estimated per individual, while the model constants were estimated for the whole population, using a group of patients judged most suited for the determination of that constant. The order of fitting and the type of subjects, discussed above, were chosen in such a way that the constants that had not yet been fitted exerted minimal influence on the constant being fitted. With the new model equation and settings, we examined whether the results are comparible to those in our first paper . were fitted with the new model and the results were compared with those from the first model implementation . In the first implementation, the model reproduced a shift in 'LDL peak size', which was independently measured. The model analysis also identified credible changes in relevant biological processes between groups with differing 'LDL peak size'. Since the models are different and the new model has one free parameter less, which in general leads to less optimal model performance, we did not expect an exact match between the model results. The model with optimized constants and one free parameter less than in the first implementation  reproduced the data from Packard et al. The overall fit error, defined in , was 7.3% ± 3.6% in this study compared to a 7.2% ± 4.5% error in our first paper. In  the model calculated a difference in LDL size of 4.2 nm between subjects with phenotype 'A' (large LDL particles) versus phenotype ' B' (small LDL particles). The latter are shown in Table 2. For particle size differences between phenotypes were found for LDL and IDL, and for the new implementation an additional difference in VLDL1 particle diameter was found. So all in all we have carried out a necessary simplification of the model, while keeping the overall model performance stable. Only those processes that show a significant difference (p < 0.1) using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test are included. Because these quantities cannot be measured directly, the best way of validating the model is through corroboration. We inspected whether the model was able to fit data from all these studies well. If successful, this indicates that the biology incorporated in the model in the form of mathematical equations is adequate to describe the measured experimental data, or in other words that the model is consistent with reality. The highest errors were found when analyzing data from Demant et al. We consider the deviation in this single study of small relevance, because it occurs not only in the diseased subjects, but also in the controls. Normolipidemic controls do not give problems in any other study. Without these subjects the average fit error was 8.8% ± 5.0%. Graphical representation of the VLDL performance diagnostic. The information from these ratios can be summarized in a single statistic taking the mean of these two ratios, which can be visualized as a projection on the identity line. These are k u , l i v e r V L D L ¯ J p , V L D L , k l V L D L ¯ J p , V L D L , and VLDL performance, whose mathematical definition can be found below. A schematic introduction can be found in Figure 2. Where d i , j r represents the radius of the subclass with average diameter d i, j . To show in a single value how efficiently produced VLDL particles are metabolized, we introduce the 'VLDL performance' diagnostic, which is the average of the previous two ratios. Both ratios and VLDL performance have the dimension volume * particles -1 . Figure 2 graphically shows how VLDL performance and the two ratios are related, and how different disturbances in VLDL metabolism affect VLDL performance. Our pool of dyslipidemic subjects was defined as all the subjects that were considered to be 'dislipidemic' in each study. Subjects for which the measured particle influx and efflux differed more than 10% in one class (LDL, IDL, VLDL1 or VLDL2) were judged not to be at steady state and excluded from the dataset. A summary of the data used for the analysis can be found in Table 3. The dyslipidemic state of the selected patients is always very clearly distinguishable from the normolipidemic state, so that an effect can be observed with a small number of patients. Normolipidemic controls: apoE 3/3 subjects. Subject groups used for normolipidemia, dyslipidemia, and genetic disorders. If subjects needed to be excluded from a group because of a lack of steady state in the data (in- and efflux balance), individual subjects are mentioned. We tested whether particle Profiler-derived VLDL performance was different for normolipidemic versus dyslipidemic subjects. The parameters we introduce are completely novel; there is no similar diagnostic method that we can compare them to. The differences with standard diagnostics were expressed as the ability to correctly predict the known normolipidemic or dyslipidemic state from the diagnostic parameters. The test consisted of two phases: first the predictive power of each diagnostic separately, then the predictive power of multivariate models. For the multivariate models we performed logistic regression, we subsequently added LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL performance as predictor variables. The diagnostic accuracy was quantified using ROC curves . We used both the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Partial Area Under the Curve statistics (pAUC - for false positive rates < 0.2)  to quantify the predictive power of each separate diagnostic and of each multivariate regression model. Figure 3a shows ROC curves that describe how well LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL performance distinguished normolipidemic from dyslipidemic subjects. Figure 3b shows ROC curves of multivariate regression models that successively incorporate these diagnostics for making the same distinction together. Table 4 shows the partial area-under-the-curve (pAUC) and area-under-the-curve AUC values, indicating diagnostic power for dyslipidemia, for each of the regression models. The table shows that VLDL performance distinguished normolipidemics better from dyslipidemics than the routine clinical chemistry parameters. Also, VLDL performance improved the distinction when used in combination with LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. When accepting no false positives, the model including VLDL performance had a 91% sensitivity for correctly identifying dyslipidemic subjects, versus a 67% sensitivity when using only triglycerides, HDLc and LDLc. Therefore, VLDL performance had additional value for distinguishing dyslipidemic from normolipidemic subjects compared to standard diagnostics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for dyslipidemia. These curves indicate how well a) single diagnostics and b) multivariate regression models distinguish dyslipidemic subjects from normolipidemic subjects. The models in b) subsequently include LDLc, HDLc, TG, and VLDL performance in cumulative fashion. The ROC curve indicates with what sensitivity various diagnostics can identify dyslipidemic subjects, when varying the acceptable false-positive rate. An ROC curve further away from the 1-1 identity line indicates a better diagnostic. For example, when not accepting false positives, the regression model including LDLc, HDLc and TG has a sensitivity of 66% (0.66), while additionally including the VLDL performance diagnostic results in a sensitivity of 91% (0.91). Partial area under the curve (pAUC) and area under the curve (AUC) calculated from ROC curves of various diagnostics and combinations of diagnostics for distinguishing dyslipidemic subjects from normolipidemic subjects. Both pAUC and AUC are a measure of how well each diagnostic predicts the dyslipidemic status, with the difference that the pAUC only takes into account those predictions for which the false positive rate is smaller than 0.2, while the AUC takes into account all possible false positive rates. Next, we examined the average value of our VLDL-related diagnostic parameters for each of the studied subgroups. This comparison included subject groups for which no standard clinical chemistry parameters were available (normolipidemic subjects from [17–22]) and subject groups with specific genetic disorders. The figure clearly indicates that the normolipidemic groups (green and light-green lines) had a higher VLDL performance (projection onto the identity line) than dyslipidemic groups. The average VLDL performance of various subject groups. Green lines with round ends are normolipidemic subject groups. Groups indicated with darker green were used for the ROC curve in figure 3, those indicated with light green were not. Red lines with crosses represent dyslipidemic subject groups used for the ROC curve. Blue lines with triangles indicate subject groups with specific genetic variant. A diagnostic's clinical usefulness increases if there are treatment options when the diagnostic indicates illness. Therefore, we investigated how our VLDL-related diagnostic parameters respond to treatment. had too few subjects to distinguish this effect. VLDL performance response to treatment. Average VLDL performance response (on identity line) to Atorvastatin, Simvastatin and Fenofibrate treatment in mixed hyperlipidemic patients [24, 25]. In continuation, for calibrating the model constants, we used published data from LPL deficient, apoE 3/3 and apoE 2/2 subjects. , in which the overall error was comparable to that found in the first model implementation , while the new implementation had a smaller standard deviation of the error. It is encouraging that with fewer free parameters the newly optimized model had an approximately equal fit error. The smaller standard deviation of the fit error indicates that the three subjects for which the uptake flux was not fitted well in the initial implementation were fitted better in the current implementation. In our first paper, we compared the modeled LDL peak size between groups with measured differences in LDL peak size . However, we still detect an LDL peak size difference between groups, although with less significance than before. This last change is likely to be a consequence of the model calibration performed with data from genetically deficient subjects. Overall, we have carried out a necessary simplification of the model, while keeping the model performance stable. The only available option for the technical model validation was corroborating the model, since the model outcomes cannot be measured directly. The VLDL performance diagnostic was able to distinguish normolipidemic from dyslipidemic subjects. These results show that VLDL performance distinguished between normolipidemic and dyslipidemic subjects more clearly than standard clinical chemistry parameters. Subjects with genetic deficiencies showed up at the expected places in the between-group comparison. In order to improve its performance we specified a reparametrisation, specific for the data type used in this paper. This specification of parameters may lead to problems in the fitting routine in specific cases, when the boundary values of processes are reached. Therefore, during the parameter conversion process from fitted parameters to parameters for model calculation, the following fitted parameters were dynamically set to their boundary value. This procedure means that a parameter is only set to its boundary value if necessary, otherwise it is fitted normally. The size range of each size class are shown in Table 5. The size range of each size class has been estimated as shown in this table, modified from . This adjustment is specific for the type of data used. Data and model predictions were divided by the scaling factors shown in this table. We would like to thank Rajasekhar Ramakrishnan and Sabine Bijlsma for expert statistical advice.
