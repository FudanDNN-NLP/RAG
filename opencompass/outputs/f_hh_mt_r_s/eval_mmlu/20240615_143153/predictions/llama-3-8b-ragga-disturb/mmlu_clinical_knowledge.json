It accounts for approximately 60-80% of all dementia cases. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells and the shrinking of brain tissue. Although the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is still not fully understood, age, family history, and certain genetic factors are known to increase the risk. Other common causes of dementia in adults include vascular dementia, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and Lewy body dementia, which is characterized by abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain. It is important to note that a comprehensive medical evaluation is needed to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of dementia. There are several different types of dementia, including Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for about 66% of cases. It is characterized by the buildup of proteins in the brain, which form plaques and tangles. Lewy body dementia (LBD) constitutes around 15% of dementia cases. It is caused by the accumulation of protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, in the brain. LBD can be challenging to diagnose as its symptoms overlap with other forms of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Doctors look for a combination of cognitive, motor, and psychiatric symptoms alongside medical history and neurological exams to make a diagnosis. Other rarer forms of dementia can be linked to alcohol abuse, HIV, or other factors that affect the brain. The diagnosis of these forms of dementia may involve specific tests or evaluations depending on the underlying cause. It's important for doctors to accurately diagnose the specific type of dementia in order to develop an appropriate treatment plan and provide support to patients and their families. For many people, dementia means Alzheimer's. But Alzheimer's isn't the only type of dementia; there are actually several different forms. According to Alzheimer's Society, there are around 520,000 people in the UK with dementia - a set of symptoms that may include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. While 20% have vascular dementia, 15% have Lewy body dementia, and under five% have a condition called frontotemporal dementia. In addition, there are some rarer forms of the disease including types related to alcohol and HIV, where the brain can be affected. The specific symptoms that someone with dementia experiences will depend on the parts of the brain that are damaged and the specific condition that is causing it. The disease is progressive so symptoms worsen over time. When this happens, problems with cognition can occur. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is caused by tiny deposits of protein laid down in the brain. Lewy bodies at the base of the brain are closely linked to movement, whereas deposits on the outer edges of the brain affect cognitive function (memory and perception). Although only 4% of people with dementia are diagnosed with LBD, it's estimated that it's often incorrectly diagnosed as Alzheimer's or vascular dementia and that 10-15% of people may actually suffer from it. LBD has some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's and of Parkinson's. It occurs when brain cells at the front or the temporal region of the brain die. Hannah Churchill, research communications officer from Alzheimer's Society explains: \"There is no single test for dementia. Churchill advises: \"A brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan can be done.\" Churchill says: \"There is no cure currently for any type of dementia and most are progressive but at different rates. Lifestyle changes may slow down the progress of dementia as well as preventing it. The main causes are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease because they affect or deteriorate brain functions. Other diseases and conditions that cause NCDs include vascular dementia, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body disease, prion disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and dementia/neurocognitive issues due to HIV infection. They may also include dementia due to substance abuse or exposure to toxins.

Diplopia and cranial palsy comprise one of the most sweeping differential diagnoses in all of ophthalmology eye care. Diplopia occurs when the eyes are not moving together so that the brain is getting two slightly different pictures simultaneously. Rarely, MS patients may develop double vision from a sixth nerve palsy or other neuro-ophthalmologic disorder. An important question to ask is whether the visual problem goes away if either eye is closed. Because diplopia is caused by the brain receiving two different images, one from each eye, as soon as eithereye is closed, this type of visual problem will go away. On examination, there may be an obvious problem with the movement of the eyes, but sometimes the misalignment is not easy to see without special equipment. This occurs when the images produced by the two eyes do not absolutely match, so that the images produced are misaligned relative to one another. The diplopia disappears when one eye is covered. It affects one eye only and continues when the unaffected eye is covered. Abducens (also called sixth) nerve palsy is the most common in MS and affects the nerve which operates lateral rectus muscle which pulls the eye outwards. Oculomotor (also called third) nerve palsy is much rarer than abducnes in MS and it’s not really understood why. Forth nerve palsy is often associated with vertical diplopia. A related paralysis, called internuclear ophthalmoplegia, sometimes, but not always, leads to double vision. It is due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle, which is also commonly affected by MS.\nDiplopia often resolves on its own in six to 8 weeks time. The eye patch is guaranteed to “cure” the diplopia, since only one eye will be sending an image to the brain, but some patients may feel self-conscious while wearing the patch. Prism eyeglasses are similar to prescription eyeglasses for reading. In rare cases, strabismus surgery (surgery to correct crossed eye) may be recommended to realign the eyes. For some people, wearing a patch over one eye or frosted tape over one lens of their glasses helps block visual input from one eye, thereby achieving single vision until the exacerbation is over. There is no danger in developing a “lazy eye” from patching. If patching is not effective, prism lenses may be incorporated into eyeglasses to redirect the way light enters the eye. Over time, the eye muscles learn to fuse the images into one. When patching and prisms don’t work, doctors may prescribe steroids. It may result in horizontal diplopia or double vision, where the patient sees two images side by side. This is because the misalignment of the eyes causes each eye to receive a different visual input. In this case, the eye affected by the fourth nerve palsy may intort or rotate inward on attempted downward gaze. A compensatory head tilt to the opposite shoulder, known as Bielschowsky sign, is a characteristic feature of fourth-nerve lesions.

Some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings, while others have a mix of both. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, spasticity, muscle spasm, and abnormal reflexes. Pure upper motor neuron diseases, or those with just UMN findings, include PLS. Pure lower motor neuron diseases, or those with just LMN findings, include PMA. Motor neuron diseases with both UMN and LMN findings include both familial and sporadic ALS. Upper motor neuron paralysis refers to an injury or lesion that occurs in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in damage to the upper motor neurons. On the other hand, lower motor neuron paralysis refers to damage or injury to the lower motor neurons that are located in the spinal cord or brainstem and connect to the muscles directly. The main difference between upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis lies in the location of the damage or injury. Upper motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the upper motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord, while lower motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the lower motor neurons located in the spinal cord or brainstem. Additionally, muscle weakness, though present, may not be as severe as in lower motor neuron paralysis. Both upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis can result in significant motor impairment and loss of function. Upper motor neuron lesions typically present with spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski's sign. Both types of lesions result in weakness. During testing, look for signs of spasticity (indicative of upper motor neuron lesions) such as stiffness or increased resistance during movement. After an upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion, there are distinct clinical deficits that can be observed, particularly in relation to muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. In lower motor neuron lesions, the loss of lower motor neurons leads to several changes in muscle function. Furthermore, deep tendon reflexes are decreased in lower motor neuron lesions, a condition known as hyporeflexia. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with different clinical deficits. In the early stages of upper motor neuron lesions, the muscles initially display hypotonia and hyporeflexia, similar to lower motor neuron lesions. However, over time, the muscles affected by upper motor neuron lesions develop increased tone (hypertonia) and deep tendon reflexes become exaggerated (hyperreflexia), a condition known as spasticity. One specific marker of an upper motor neuron lesion is the presence of the Babinski sign. It's worth noting that in a normal child who has not yet begun walking, a positive Babinski sign can be observed since the upper motor neurons have not yet functionally modified lower motor neuron activity. To summarize, the clinical deficits observed after an upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion differ in terms of muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. Lower motor neuron lesions are characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, hypotonia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with muscle weakness, hypertonia, increased deep tendon reflexes, and the development of spasticity. The presence of the Babinski sign can also be indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. The main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions can be distinguished from lower motor neuron lesions based on specific characteristics. Upper motor neuron lesions typically result in spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and clonus, while lower motor neuron lesions are associated with weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. Another characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions is hyperreflexia, which refers to an exaggerated response of deep tendon reflexes. The presence of the Babinski sign is also indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. In individuals with upper motor neuron lesions, this reflex is abnormal, with the toes extending rather than flexing.

In summary, the main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions include spasticity, hyperreflexia, the Babinski sign, and clonus.

The breakdown of glycogen, known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose 1-phosphate (G1P). The G1P is converted to G6P by phosphoglucomutase. G6P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G6P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source.

When oxygen \n\nIn the well-fed state, glucose-6-phosphate primarily undergoes glycogenesis, which involves the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into glycogen for storage. Glycogen serves as a readily available source of glucose when energy demand increases or when blood glucose levels drop. This process occurs in various tissues, including the liver and skeletal muscles. Glycogenesis is a complex process that involves several enzymatic reactions. After a meal, when blood glucose levels are high, the liver takes up glucose and converts it into glucose-6-phosphate through the action of the enzyme glucokinase. In contrast, skeletal muscles primarily store glycogen for their own energy needs. Overall, in the well-fed state, the major fate of glucose-6-phosphate in tissues is its conversion into glycogen for storage, which serves as a critical energy reserve. It lies at the start of two major metabolic pathways: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to these two metabolic pathways, glucose 6-phosphate may also be converted to glycogen or starch for storage.

On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline. When the body needs glucose for energy, glycogen phosphorylase, with the help of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain.
