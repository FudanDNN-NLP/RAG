In science diplomacy, collaboration takes place to advance science but science can also be used to facilitate diplomatic relations. This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. Plague, Yellow Fever, and Cholera \nFollowing the Congress of Vienna in 1815, a new era of international trade and cooperation began in Europe. The Habsburg Empire, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Prussia, as the victors, used their power to enforce quarantines. Outbreaks of plague and cholera in the Ottoman Empire led to the creation of the Constantinople Council of Health, which included European members. Plague was endemic to the Ottoman Empire at this point, so the Austrian Empire had a border zone with the Ottoman Empire and did not allow passage except at places where quarantine was possible. The Ottoman Empire used European knowledge to decrease the spread of disease. While quarantine became a common practice by the mid-fifteenth century, it was frequently used to further political ends. Even though it was unclear whether quarantine was effective, it was still used by European states during an outbreak of cholera in European Russia in 1830. Quarantine measures were highly impacted by commercial interests, however. The government of Louis Phillipe in France suggested international guidelines for quarantine to prevent their use for political gain. M. de Segur Dupeyron, as part of this government, studied quarantine and found that outbreaks of plague were directly tied to commerce. As such, quarantines were effective, but their unsystematic nature made them unduly oppressive. The French government took heed and spent many years attempting to arrange an international meeting. However, different nations had different goals: England and France wanted a decrease in quarantines to promote their commercial and colonial interests while Mediterranean countries wanted to maintain quarantines for their recognized public benefit. Much of the convention was spent debating whether cholera was contagious and whether quarantines were effective against cholera. The convention was signed by only France, Portugal, and Sardinia. There were a total of nine International Sanitary Conferences that focused on cholera, occurring from 1851-1894. It initially appeared in China at the end of 2002 and quickly spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The virus that causes SARS is known as SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly contagious, producing sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. WHO also utilized the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), developed for WHO by Health Canada, to improve the speed of outbreak detection and advance the response time. WHO also partnered with GOARN to dispatch teams of experts into areas heavily impacted by SARS such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. In addition, researchers from laboratories around the world shared their findings with each other in hopes of gaining better understanding of the disease to test possible vaccines for SARS. They also established and dispatched teams of specialists of multiple backgrounds to conduct on-site investigations of SARS and carried out extensive research to test SARS specimen in order to identify its cause and transmission behavior. Researchers in a 2005 journal proposed possible methods of vaccine development noting the possibility of an inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccine. They also proposed spike (S) protein, a glycoprotein component of SARS-CoV membrane, based vaccines as well as a recombinant RBD (a fragment in S protein) based vaccines. They concluded that of these methods, RBD vaccines may be the safest means of combating SARS, though no such effective vaccine currently exists. Collaboration between the U.S and China also improved after SARS as Tommy Thompson, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services visited China in October 2003 and \"signed a multiyear partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to develop a more robust public health infrastructure in China. China's overall responsiveness and preparedness to infectious disease has also significantly improved since SARS as evident by their cooperative efforts in curbing the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The importance of open collaboration was acknowledged formally in May 2003 when a resolution was adopted on SARS by delegates at the World Health Assembly; it called for the full support of all countries in combating SARS along with full transparency and steadfast reporting of requested information. A second resolution to improve International Health Regulations gave WHO the authority to take a much stronger role in case of infectious diseases that pose a threat to public health. This allowed WHO to act and respond to outbreaks using its own resources rather than waiting for official government notifications of outbreaks. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deaths\n\nMoreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014–2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others. Zika \n\nZika a flavivirus (a genus of viruses in the family of Flaviviridae) and a mosquito-borne disease first identified in monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. The first outbreak of Zika virus outside of Africa or Asia took place in 2007, within the state of Yap in Micronesia. In 2013, a large-scale Zika infection in French Polynesia and other countries and territories in the Pacific was recorded. The WHO declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following a series of global outbreaks and rising cases of neurological disorders in humans in 2015–2016. In March 2015, Zika virus was first discovered in the Americas when Brazil reported a large spike in fine, maculopapular rashes among people, soon identified as Zika virus infection. Additionally, an increase in fetal microcephaly, as well as other neurological abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. The global humanitarian response against Zika has occurred on many fronts, with much effort devoted to developing anti-Zika virus vaccines and therapeutics. In 2016, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted a human clinical trial of the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine. The WHO issued guidelines outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Framework to effectively interfere and help families, communities and countries to control Zika virus disease. The four main goals of their response plan - detection, prevention, care, and support and research - have supported national governments and communities to prevent and manage the complications of Zika virus. This plan detailed the development and distribution of MAC-ELISA testing kits to the US and the development of Trioplex rRT-PCR to detect Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viral RNA. COVID-19 \nOn December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. China did eventually share the genome sequence of COVID-19 with the global community and later accepted another offer from the WHO to send a team of scientists to help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, governments did not take it into proper consideration. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. The overall impact on society would have been less detrimental if governments had acted in collaboration with each other and scientists. Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. Scientists are publishing research findings before they are peer-reviewed and sharing other discoveries without delay. Scientists and clinicians are working to fight the epidemic by sharing data through information sharing technologies using bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, and arXiv, which allows them to share information in real time. As one researcher explains, “We are experiencing a shift towards Open Science at a speed that was previously unthinkable. It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank – an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information”\n\nAdditionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. \"To denote the ever-growing relevance of activities in this area, the term “vaccine diplomacy” has been widely used\", which \"means a set of diplomatic measures taken to ensure access to the best practices in the development of potential vaccines, to enhance bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation between countries in conducting joint R&D, and, in the case of the announcement of production, to ensure the signing of a contract for the purchase of the vaccine at the shortest term.\" Another example is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that was developed between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. In January of 2021, the United Kingdom finally began to distribute Oxford Astra-Zeneca  Around the same time, Moderna ramped up their vaccine production to help supply the U.S government and clinical trials for the only 3 FDA-approved vaccines began. By the end of the month, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax continue their trials to get approval and South Africa suspends the Oxford Astra-Zeneca dose due to the different variants. Unfortunately, the CDC  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and FDA had put a pause on Janssen vaccine as 6 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot) have been reported. Shortly after, the European Commission (E.C) also put a halt on both J&J and Astra-Zeneca due to similar complications. Clinical Trials\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is a non-profit vaccine developed for the purpose of distribution toward lower and middle-income countries. The test’s accuracy is supported by the size of the sample group, diversity of ethnic communities and gender represented, and similarity of results between countries. Operation Warp Speed \nThe rapid development of the Coronavirus vaccine was achieved with the contribution of organizations like Operation Warp Speed (OWS) which formed contracts to fund vaccine companies in the development and distribution of vaccines. Due to the necessity of a Coronavirus 19 vaccine, the FDA approved unlicensed vaccines that adhere to the EUA standard to be utilized and OWS accelerated the development by allowing trials that would occur concurrently to be done simultaneously with mRNA and Replication-defective live-vector platforms for vaccine having the potential to be readily mass-produced. Equitable Distribution Concerns\nScience diplomacy is necessary to establish infrastructure for distributing COVAX’s vaccine to poorer countries that lack the framework to utilize the doses. The failure of the 2009 H1N1 Virus Vaccine Deployment Initiative (VDI) to allocate vaccines to countries that had difficulties with developing a deployment plan resulted in the poorest countries receiving the least aid during the pandemic. Vaccine Nationalism \nUnited Nation Resolution 74/274 allowed for the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate efforts for developing a Covid-19 vaccine and developed the resource sharing platform ACT-Accelerator. Vaccine Nationalism poses an obstacle to COVAX Facility's aim to equitably distribute the vaccine across the world funded by higher-income countries over concerns such as increasing cost and delaying distribution of the vaccine. Communication and Open Source Networks\nCommunication technologies have a prominent role in communication during Coronavirus 19 as laboratories and in-person research conferences were closed due to physical distancing measures. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, Oxford Uni-AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V are both viral vector vaccines. It is evident that there is inequality amongst the distribution of vaccines. This is due to the fact that demand is greater than supply. Countries mainly in Africa are seen to have the lowest rates of vaccinations due to their lack of resources, technology, and international assistance .In an effort to control the pandemic, not only is the development of the vaccine important, but the worldwide rollout of vaccines is too. India’s health crisis had led to Covax sending most of their supply over to India to help control the outbreak. The U.S company Moderna has agreed to a deal with Covax in preparing 500 million doses for rollout in 2022. While countries like Sweden have offered one million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses starting May of 2021 in the efforts to put an end to this pandemic. There were recorded cases of blood clots in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), in the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis), and in other arteries as well. As soon as these cases emerged, many countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, etc. By April 13, 2021, there were reports that within two weeks of receiving the vaccine, six women developed rare blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) accompanied with low blood platelets levels (thrombocytopenia) in which one case was fatal. Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines were resumed for use because officials have decided that the benefits outweighed the risks and that there were extremely rare chances of developing blood clots from the vaccines, which was also why none of these cases appeared during clinical trials. India's Second Wave\nIndia has been hard hit with another wave reporting up to 400,000 cases and approximately 3,000 deaths each day. Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech are some of the main Indian companies for vaccine production. This caused India to put a halt in overseas shipments. India has been administering their own vaccine known as Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, as well as their local Covishield (known as Oxford-AstraZeneca). Assistance from other nations have also been provided to slow down the spread and death rate in India. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has also recently been approved for use to aid with the dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases. The United States has agreed to fund these biotech companies with supplies for accelerated production. Approval of other global vaccines are in the process to get India immune as quickly as possible. While India faces shortages of oxygen supply, hospital beds and vaccines; places like the U.S and Australia are restricting any travelers from India into their countries to help stop the spread. This pandemic continues to have detrimental impacts on societies, environments, and the economy but it has also shown us that with science diplomacy and the sharing of knowledge, the fight against the novel coronavirus is possible.

The arquebus was later adopted by European armies during the Italian Wars of the early 16th century. This all brought an end to the dominance of armored cavalry on the battlefield. The simultaneous decline of the feudal system – and the absorption of the medieval city-states into larger states – allowed the creation of professional standing armies to replace the feudal levies and mercenaries that had been the standard military component of the Middle Ages. In Africa, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, was the first African commander to use gunpowder on the \n\nThe United States biological weapons program began in 1943 and was discontinued in 1969. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven bio-agents (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\nBacillus anthracis (anthrax)\nFrancisella tularensis (tularemia)\nBrucella spp (brucellosis)\nCoxiella burnetii (Q-fever)\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus\nBotulinum toxin (botulism)\nStaphylococcal enterotoxin B\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)—international treaties outlawing biological warfare. History\n\nEarly history (1918–1941)\nInitial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of World War I. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin ricin, a product of the castor plant. The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to shrapnel for delivery by artillery shell, was successful; the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests. Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended. Chief of the CWS, Amos Fries, decided that such a program would not be \"profitable\" for the U.S. Japan's Shiro Ishii began promoting biological weapons during the 1920s and toured biological research facilities worldwide, including in the United States. Though Ishii concluded that the U.S. was developing a bio-weapons programs, he was incorrect. In fact, Ishii concluded that each major power he visited was developing a bio-weapons program. As the interwar period continued, the United States did not emphasize biological weapons development or research. While the U.S. was spending very little time on biological weapons research, its future allies and enemies in the upcoming second World War were researching the potential of biological weapons as early as 1933.,\n\nWorld War II (1941–45)\nDespite the World War I-era interest in ricin, as World War II erupted, the United States Army still maintained the position that biological weapons were, for the most part, impractical. Other nations, notably France, Japan and the United Kingdom, thought otherwise and had begun their own biological weapons programs. That fall, U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) undertake consideration of U.S. biological warfare. He wrote to Dr. Frank B. Jewett, then president of the NAS:\n\nBecause of the dangers that might confront this country from potential enemies employing what may be broadly described as biological warfare, it seems advisable that investigations be initiated to survey the present situation and the future possibilities. In response the NAS formed a committee, the War Bureau of Consultants (WBC), which issued a report on the subject in February 1942. The British, and the research undertaken by the WBC, pressured the U.S. to begin biological weapons research and development and in November 1942 U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt officially approved an American biological weapons program. Though initially, under George Merck, the WRS contracted several universities to participate in the U.S. biological weapons program, the program became large quickly and before long it was under the full control of the CWS. Cold War (1947–1969)\nFollowing World War II, the United States biological warfare program progressed into an effective, military-driven research and production program, covered in controversy and secrecy. From the end of World War II through the Korean War, the U.S. Army, the Chemical Corps and the U.S. Air Force all expanded their biological warfare programs significantly, especially concerning delivery systems. At the trial of John W. Powell and two other defendants for sedition for reporting that the U.S. used biological weapons during the Korean War, the U.S. Attorney in the case, Robert H. Schnacke and the former Chief of the Special Operations Division at Ft. Detrick during the Korean War (and long-time U.S. Chemical Corps officer), John L. Schwab, entered sworn affidavits that the U.S. Army had the capability to use both offensive and defensive biological and chemical weapons \"during the period from January 1, 1949 through July 27, 1953.... based upon resources available and retained only within the continental limits of the United States.\" A 10 November 1969 report by the Interdepartmental Political-Military Group submitted its findings to the Nixon administration that the American BW capability was limited:\n\nField testing of the biological weapons was completed covertly and successfully with simulants and agents dispersed over wide, open areas. The first American large-scale aerosol vulnerability test occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in September 1950, using two types of bacteria (Bacillus globigii and Serratia marcescens) and fluorescent particles. Rosebury published Peace or Pestilence? In 1969, Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson argued that the biological warfare programs would eventually hurt US security because potential enemy nations could easily emulate these weapons. This included new production plants for anthrax, brucellosis, and anti-crop agents, as well as the development of the cluster bomb. The goal of the experiment, unknown to the volunteers, was to standardize tularaemia bomb-fill for attacks on civilian populations. Pathogens studied included the biological agents causing a myriad of diseases such as anthrax, glanders, brucellosis, melioidosis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and other plant and animal pathogens. The use of chemicals, riot-control agents, and herbicides like Agent Orange drew international criticism, and negatively affected the U.S. public opinion on the development of biological weapons. Jeanne Guillemin, wife of biologist Matthew Meselson, summarized the controversy:\n\nThe Nixon administration felt an urgent need to respond to the growing negative perception of biological weapons. Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as wheat stem rust, were stored at Beale Air Force Base and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Geneva Protocol and BWC\nThe 1925 Geneva Protocol, ratified by most major powers in the 1920s and 30s, had still not been ratified by the United States at the dawn of World War II. Among the Protocol's provisions was a ban on bacteriological warfare. The Geneva Protocol had encountered opposition in the U.S. Senate, in part due to strong lobbying against it by the Chemical Warfare Service, and it was never brought to the floor for a vote when originally introduced. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. Agents studied and weaponized\nWhen the U.S. biological warfare program ended in 1969 it had developed six mass-produced, battle-ready biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and botulism. In addition to the agents that were ready to be used, the U.S. program conducted research into the weaponization of more than 20 other agents. They included: smallpox, EEE and WEE, AHF, Hantavirus, BHF, Lassa fever, Coronavirus, melioidosis, plague, yellow fever, psittacosis, typhus, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), CHIKV, late blight of potato, rinderpest, Newcastle disease, bird flu, and the toxin ricin. Besides the numerous pathogens that afflict human beings, the U.S. had developed an arsenal of anti-agriculture biological agents. These included rye stem rust spores (stored at Edgewood Arsenal, 1951–1957), wheat stem rust spores (stored at the same facility 1962–1969), and the causative agent of rice blast (stored at Fort Detrick 1965–1966). The first agent that was a candidate for development was foot and mouth disease (FMD). The eleven miscellaneous pathogens were: Blue tongue virus, bovine influenza, bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), fowl plague, goat pneumonitis, mycobacteria, \"N\" virus, Newcastle disease, sheep pox, Teschers disease, and vesicular stomatitis. Work on delivery systems for the U.S. bioweapons arsenal led to the first mass-produced biological weapon in 1952, the M33 cluster bomb. The M33's sub-munition, the pipe-bomb-like cylindrical M114 bomb, was also completed and battle-ready by 1952. Other delivery systems researched and at least partially developed during the 1950s included the E77 balloon bomb and the E86 cluster bomb. Production of cluster bomb submunitions began to shift from cylindrical to spherical bomblets, which had a larger coverage area. Development of the spherical E120 bomblet took place in the early 1960s as did development of the M143 bomblet, similar to the chemical M139 bomblet. The experimental Flettner rotor bomblet was also developed during this time period. Alleged uses\n\nKorean War\n\n \nIn 1952, during the Korean War, the Chinese and North Koreans insinuated that mysterious outbreaks of disease in North Korea and China were due to U.S. biological attacks. Despite contrary assertions from the International Red Cross and World Health Organization, whom the Chinese denounced as being dominated by US influence and thus biased, the Chinese government pursued an investigation by the World Peace Council. In eastern Europe, China, and North Korea it was widely believed that the accusations were true. A 1988 book Korea: The Unknown War, by Western historians Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, also suggested the claims might be true. In 1998, Canadian researchers and historians Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman of York University made the case that the accusations were true in their book, The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea. The book received mostly positive reviews, out of a collection of 20 reviews cited, 2 were negative, calling it \"bad history\" and \"appalling\", while others praised the authors, \"Endicott and Hagerman is far and away the most authoritative work on the subject\" and \"the most impressive, expertly researched and, as far as the official files allow, the best-documented case for the prosecution yet made\". In the same year Endicott's book was published, Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents that claimed to have revealed that the biowarfare allegation was an elaborate disinformation campaign by the communists. In addition, a Japanese journalist claims to have seen similar evidence of a Soviet disinformation campaign and that the evidence supporting its occurrence was faked. In 2001, anti-communist historian Herbert Romerstein supported Weathersby and Leitenberg, criticizing Endicott's research for using evidence provided by the Chinese government. In this program, Professor Mori Masataka investigated historical artifacts in the form of bomb casings from US biological weapons, contemporary documentary evidence and eyewitness testimonies. In September 2020, U.S. author Jeffrey Kaye published a set of declassified CIA communications reports (COMINT) that documented the responses of military units for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as they were apparently under attack by biological weapons, particularly the dropping of bacteria-laden insects. One  report from an identified Chinese military unit on February 26, 1952 said, \"yesterday it was discovered that in our bivouac area there was a real flood of bacteria and germs from a plane by the enemy. In another example, on March 6, 1952, the 23rd Brigade of the Korean People's Army sent a “long detailed… message to one of its subordinate battalions” suggesting preventive measures be taken against 'bacteria' dropped by UN aircraft, apparently in the area around Sariwon. Their nervous systems were said to have become 'benumbed. These claims are disputed, however one of the documented goals of the CIA’s Operation Mongoose was to induce crop failures in Cuba. Also in 1962, a  Canadian agricultural technician assisting the Cuban government claimed he was paid $5,000 to infect Cuban turkeys with the deadly Newcastle disease. The Cuban government alleged that U.S. covert biological warfare was responsible for this outbreak, which led to the preemptive slaughter of 500,000 pigs. Six years after the event, the newspaper Newsday, citing an anonymous former CIA agent, claimed that anti-Castro saboteurs, with at least the tacit backing of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials, introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba six weeks before the outbreak in 1971, to destabilize the Cuban economy and encourage domestic opposition to Fidel Castro. The Cuban government blamed the U.S. for a 1981 outbreak of dengue fever that sickened more than 300,000. Dengue is a vector-borne disease usually carried by mosquitoes, the same species of yellow-fever mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) utilized in Operation Big Buzz in 1955. Dengue 2 killed 158 people that year in Cuba, including 101 children under 15. Hemorrhagic Dengue 2 had not appeared in the Caribbean until this point and the two closest islands, Jamaica and Bahamas, reported no cases during this time. The fever appeared simultaneously in three separate areas (Havana, Cienfuegos, and Camagüey) hundreds of miles apart. Tensions between the two countries, coupled with confirmed U.S. research into entomological warfare during the 1950s, made these charges seem not implausible to some scientists and historians. By July 1981, Cuba was had widespread sugar cane rust, African Swine Fever, tobacco blue mold, Dengue 2, meningitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and several parasites targeting staple crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes. None of these had been present in the region before 1960. Experimentation and testing\n\nEntomological testing\n\nThe United States seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare (EW) during the Cold War. EW is a specific type of biological warfare which aims to use insects as weapon, either directly or through their potential to act as vectors. Clinical trials\nOperation Whitecoat involved the controlled testing of many serious agents on military personnel who had  consented to experimentation, and who  understood the risks involved. Vulnerability field tests\n\nIn military venues\nIn August 1949 a U.S. Army Special Operations Division, operating out of Fort Detrick in Maryland, set up its first test at The Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Operatives sprayed harmless bacteria into the building's air conditioning system and observed as the microbes spread throughout the Pentagon. The U.S. military acknowledges that it tested several chemical and biological weapons on US military personnel in the desert facility, including the East Demilitarization Area near Deseret Chemical Depot/Deseret Chemical Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, but takes the position that the tests have contributed to long-term illnesses in only a handful of exposed personnel. Often, these experiments took place in urban areas in order to test dispersion methods. Current (post-1969) bio-defense program\n\nBoth the U.S. bio-weapons ban and the Biological Weapons Convention restricted any work in the area of biological warfare to defensive in nature. In reality, this gives BWC member-states wide latitude to conduct biological weapons research because the BWC contains no provisions for monitoring or enforcement. The treaty, essentially, is a gentlemen's agreement amongst members backed by the long-prevailing thought that biological warfare should not be used in battle. In recent years certain critics have claimed the U.S. stance on biological warfare and the use of biological agents has differed from historical interpretations of the BWC. For example, it is said that the U.S. now maintains that the Article I of the BWC (which explicitly bans bio-weapons), does not apply to \"non-lethal\" biological agents. That law defined a biological agent as:\n\nany micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or bioengineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind ... According to the Federation of American Scientists, U.S. work on non-lethal agents exceeds limitations in the BWC.

There was a general increase in the size of pitched battles during this period as states grew and could wield larger standing armies using improved logistics. Firearms were introduced in Europe during the 16th century and revolutionised pitched battles due to their devastating effect when fired in sequence. Despite this, early firearms were inaccurate and slow to fire meaning that they were most effectively deployed in smaller, mobile blocks of infantry who would fire a mass of projectiles at an enemy. Due to the unreliability of these weapons these troops were supported by other groups of infantry, especially when confronted with enemy cavalry. In 16th century Italy, pike and shot infantry would have interweaving ranks of musket and pike armed soldiers to provide mobile cavalry protection. Furthermore, during this period artillery would evolve from basic stone throwers to barrelled cannons capable of mobility and more effective siege warfare. Science diplomacy is the collaborative efforts by local and global entities to solve global issues using science and technology as a base. In science diplomacy, collaboration takes place to advance science but science can also be used to facilitate diplomatic relations. This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. Plague, Yellow Fever, and Cholera \nFollowing the Congress of Vienna in 1815, a new era of international trade and cooperation began in Europe. The Habsburg Empire, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Prussia, as the victors, used their power to enforce quarantines. Outbreaks of plague and cholera in the Ottoman Empire led to the creation of the Constantinople Council of Health, which included European members. Plague was endemic to the Ottoman Empire at this point, so the Austrian Empire had a border zone with the Ottoman Empire and did not allow passage except at places where quarantine was possible. The Ottoman Empire used European knowledge to decrease the spread of disease. While quarantine became a common practice by the mid-fifteenth century, it was frequently used to further political ends. Even though it was unclear whether quarantine was effective, it was still used by European states during an outbreak of cholera in European Russia in 1830. Quarantine measures were highly impacted by commercial interests, however. The government of Louis Phillipe in France suggested international guidelines for quarantine to prevent their use for political gain. M. de Segur Dupeyron, as part of this government, studied quarantine and found that outbreaks of plague were directly tied to commerce. As such, quarantines were effective, but their unsystematic nature made them unduly oppressive. The French government took heed and spent many years attempting to arrange an international meeting. However, different nations had different goals: England and France wanted a decrease in quarantines to promote their commercial and colonial interests while Mediterranean countries wanted to maintain quarantines for their recognized public benefit. Much of the convention was spent debating whether cholera was contagious and whether quarantines were effective against cholera. The convention was signed by only France, Portugal, and Sardinia. There were a total of nine International Sanitary Conferences that focused on cholera, occurring from 1851-1894. It initially appeared in China at the end of 2002 and quickly spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The virus that causes SARS is known as SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly contagious, producing sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. WHO also utilized the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), developed for WHO by Health Canada, to improve the speed of outbreak detection and advance the response time. WHO also partnered with GOARN to dispatch teams of experts into areas heavily impacted by SARS such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. In addition, researchers from laboratories around the world shared their findings with each other in hopes of gaining better understanding of the disease to test possible vaccines for SARS. They also established and dispatched teams of specialists of multiple backgrounds to conduct on-site investigations of SARS and carried out extensive research to test SARS specimen in order to identify its cause and transmission behavior. Researchers in a 2005 journal proposed possible methods of vaccine development noting the possibility of an inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccine. They also proposed spike (S) protein, a glycoprotein component of SARS-CoV membrane, based vaccines as well as a recombinant RBD (a fragment in S protein) based vaccines. They concluded that of these methods, RBD vaccines may be the safest means of combating SARS, though no such effective vaccine currently exists. Collaboration between the U.S and China also improved after SARS as Tommy Thompson, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services visited China in October 2003 and \"signed a multiyear partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to develop a more robust public health infrastructure in China. China's overall responsiveness and preparedness to infectious disease has also significantly improved since SARS as evident by their cooperative efforts in curbing the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The importance of open collaboration was acknowledged formally in May 2003 when a resolution was adopted on SARS by delegates at the World Health Assembly; it called for the full support of all countries in combating SARS along with full transparency and steadfast reporting of requested information. A second resolution to improve International Health Regulations gave WHO the authority to take a much stronger role in case of infectious diseases that pose a threat to public health. This allowed WHO to act and respond to outbreaks using its own resources rather than waiting for official government notifications of outbreaks. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deaths\n\nMoreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014–2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others. Zika \n\nZika a flavivirus (a genus of viruses in the family of Flaviviridae) and a mosquito-borne disease first identified in monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. The first outbreak of Zika virus outside of Africa or Asia took place in 2007, within the state of Yap in Micronesia. In 2013, a large-scale Zika infection in French Polynesia and other countries and territories in the Pacific was recorded. The WHO declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following a series of global outbreaks and rising cases of neurological disorders in humans in 2015–2016. In March 2015, Zika virus was first discovered in the Americas when Brazil reported a large spike in fine, maculopapular rashes among people, soon identified as Zika virus infection. Additionally, an increase in fetal microcephaly, as well as other neurological abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. The global humanitarian response against Zika has occurred on many fronts, with much effort devoted to developing anti-Zika virus vaccines and therapeutics. In 2016, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted a human clinical trial of the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine. The WHO issued guidelines outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Framework to effectively interfere and help families, communities and countries to control Zika virus disease. The four main goals of their response plan - detection, prevention, care, and support and research - have supported national governments and communities to prevent and manage the complications of Zika virus. This plan detailed the development and distribution of MAC-ELISA testing kits to the US and the development of Trioplex rRT-PCR to detect Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viral RNA. COVID-19 \nOn December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. China did eventually share the genome sequence of COVID-19 with the global community and later accepted another offer from the WHO to send a team of scientists to help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, governments did not take it into proper consideration. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. The overall impact on society would have been less detrimental if governments had acted in collaboration with each other and scientists. Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. Scientists are publishing research findings before they are peer-reviewed and sharing other discoveries without delay. Scientists and clinicians are working to fight the epidemic by sharing data through information sharing technologies using bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, and arXiv, which allows them to share information in real time. As one researcher explains, “We are experiencing a shift towards Open Science at a speed that was previously unthinkable. It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank – an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information”\n\nAdditionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. \"To denote the ever-growing relevance of activities in this area, the term “vaccine diplomacy” has been widely used\", which \"means a set of diplomatic measures taken to ensure access to the best practices in the development of potential vaccines, to enhance bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation between countries in conducting joint R&D, and, in the case of the announcement of production, to ensure the signing of a contract for the purchase of the vaccine at the shortest term.\" Another example is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that was developed between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. In January of 2021, the United Kingdom finally began to distribute Oxford Astra-Zeneca  Around the same time, Moderna ramped up their vaccine production to help supply the U.S government and clinical trials for the only 3 FDA-approved vaccines began. By the end of the month, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax continue their trials to get approval and South Africa suspends the Oxford Astra-Zeneca dose due to the different variants. Unfortunately, the CDC  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and FDA had put a pause on Janssen vaccine as 6 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot) have been reported. Shortly after, the European Commission (E.C) also put a halt on both J&J and Astra-Zeneca due to similar complications. Clinical Trials\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is a non-profit vaccine developed for the purpose of distribution toward lower and middle-income countries. The test’s accuracy is supported by the size of the sample group, diversity of ethnic communities and gender represented, and similarity of results between countries. Operation Warp Speed \nThe rapid development of the Coronavirus vaccine was achieved with the contribution of organizations like Operation Warp Speed (OWS) which formed contracts to fund vaccine companies in the development and distribution of vaccines. Due to the necessity of a Coronavirus 19 vaccine, the FDA approved unlicensed vaccines that adhere to the EUA standard to be utilized and OWS accelerated the development by allowing trials that would occur concurrently to be done simultaneously with mRNA and Replication-defective live-vector platforms for vaccine having the potential to be readily mass-produced. Equitable Distribution Concerns\nScience diplomacy is necessary to establish infrastructure for distributing COVAX’s vaccine to poorer countries that lack the framework to utilize the doses. The failure of the 2009 H1N1 Virus Vaccine Deployment Initiative (VDI) to allocate vaccines to countries that had difficulties with developing a deployment plan resulted in the poorest countries receiving the least aid during the pandemic. Vaccine Nationalism \nUnited Nation Resolution 74/274 allowed for the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate efforts for developing a Covid-19 vaccine and developed the resource sharing platform ACT-Accelerator. Vaccine Nationalism poses an obstacle to COVAX Facility's aim to equitably distribute the vaccine across the world funded by higher-income countries over concerns such as increasing cost and delaying distribution of the vaccine. Communication and Open Source Networks\nCommunication technologies have a prominent role in communication during Coronavirus 19 as laboratories and in-person research conferences were closed due to physical distancing measures. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, Oxford Uni-AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V are both viral vector vaccines. It is evident that there is inequality amongst the distribution of vaccines. This is due to the fact that demand is greater than supply. Countries mainly in Africa are seen to have the lowest rates of vaccinations due to their lack of resources, technology, and international assistance .In an effort to control the pandemic, not only is the development of the vaccine important, but the worldwide rollout of vaccines is too. India’s health crisis had led to Covax sending most of their supply over to India to help control the outbreak. The U.S company Moderna has agreed to a deal with Covax in preparing 500 million doses for rollout in 2022. While countries like Sweden have offered one million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses starting May of 2021 in the efforts to put an end to this pandemic. There were recorded cases of blood clots in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), in the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis), and in other arteries as well. As soon as these cases emerged, many countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, etc. By April 13, 2021, there were reports that within two weeks of receiving the vaccine, six women developed rare blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) accompanied with low blood platelets levels (thrombocytopenia) in which one case was fatal. Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines were resumed for use because officials have decided that the benefits outweighed the risks and that there were extremely rare chances of developing blood clots from the vaccines, which was also why none of these cases appeared during clinical trials. India's Second Wave\nIndia has been hard hit with another wave reporting up to 400,000 cases and approximately 3,000 deaths each day. Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech are some of the main Indian companies for vaccine production. This caused India to put a halt in overseas shipments. India has been administering their own vaccine known as Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, as well as their local Covishield (known as Oxford-AstraZeneca). Assistance from other nations have also been provided to slow down the spread and death rate in India. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has also recently been approved for use to aid with the dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases. The United States has agreed to fund these biotech companies with supplies for accelerated production. Approval of other global vaccines are in the process to get India immune as quickly as possible. While India faces shortages of oxygen supply, hospital beds and vaccines; places like the U.S and Australia are restricting any travelers from India into their countries to help stop the spread. This pandemic continues to have detrimental impacts on societies, environments, and the economy but it has also shown us that with science diplomacy and the sharing of knowledge, the fight against the novel coronavirus is possible.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank – an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information”\n\nAdditionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. \"To denote the ever-growing relevance of activities in this area, the term “vaccine diplomacy” has been widely used\", which \"means a set of diplomatic measures taken to ensure access to the best practices in the development of potential vaccines, to enhance bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation between countries in conducting joint R&D, and, in the case of the announcement of production, to ensure the signing of a contract for the purchase of the vaccine at the shortest term.\" Another example is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that was developed between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. In January of 2021, the United Kingdom finally began to distribute Oxford Astra-Zeneca  Around the same time, Moderna ramped up their vaccine production to help supply the U.S government and clinical trials for the only 3 FDA-approved vaccines began. By the end of the month, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax continue their trials to get approval and South Africa suspends the Oxford Astra-Zeneca dose due to the different variants. Unfortunately, the CDC  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and FDA had put a pause on Janssen vaccine as 6 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot) have been reported. Shortly after, the European Commission (E.C) also put a halt on both J&J and Astra-Zeneca due to similar complications. Clinical Trials\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is a non-profit vaccine developed for the purpose of distribution toward lower and middle-income countries. The test’s accuracy is supported by the size of the sample group, diversity of ethnic communities and gender represented, and similarity of results between countries. Operation Warp Speed \nThe rapid development of the Coronavirus vaccine was achieved with the contribution of organizations like Operation Warp Speed (OWS) which formed contracts to fund vaccine companies in the development and distribution of vaccines. Due to the necessity of a Coronavirus 19 vaccine, the FDA approved unlicensed vaccines that adhere to the EUA standard to be utilized and OWS accelerated the development by allowing trials that would occur concurrently to be done simultaneously with mRNA and Replication-defective live-vector platforms for vaccine having the potential to be readily mass-produced. Equitable Distribution Concerns\nScience diplomacy is necessary to establish infrastructure for distributing COVAX’s vaccine to poorer countries that lack the framework to utilize the doses. The failure of the 2009 H1N1 Virus Vaccine Deployment Initiative (VDI) to allocate vaccines to countries that had difficulties with developing a deployment plan resulted in the poorest countries receiving the least aid during the pandemic. Vaccine Nationalism \nUnited Nation Resolution 74/274 allowed for the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate efforts for developing a Covid-19 vaccine and developed the resource sharing platform ACT-Accelerator. Vaccine Nationalism poses an obstacle to COVAX Facility's aim to equitably distribute the vaccine across the world funded by higher-income countries over concerns such as increasing cost and delaying distribution of the vaccine. Communication and Open Source Networks\nCommunication technologies have a prominent role in communication during Coronavirus 19 as laboratories and in-person research conferences were closed due to physical distancing measures. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, Oxford Uni-AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V are both viral vector vaccines. It is evident that there is inequality amongst the distribution of vaccines. This is due to the fact that demand is greater than supply. Countries mainly in Africa are seen to have the lowest rates of vaccinations due to their lack of resources, technology, and international assistance .In an effort to control the pandemic, not only is the development of the vaccine important, but the worldwide rollout of vaccines is too. India’s health crisis had led to Covax sending most of their supply over to India to help control the outbreak. The U.S company Moderna has agreed to a deal with Covax in preparing 500 million doses for rollout in 2022. While countries like Sweden have offered one million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses starting May of 2021 in the efforts to put an end to this pandemic. There were recorded cases of blood clots in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), in the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis), and in other arteries as well. As soon as these cases emerged, many countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, etc. By April 13, 2021, there were reports that within two weeks of receiving the vaccine, six women developed rare blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) accompanied with low blood platelets levels (thrombocytopenia) in which one case was fatal. Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines were resumed for use because officials have decided that the benefits outweighed the risks and that there were extremely rare chances of developing blood clots from the vaccines, which was also why none of these cases appeared during clinical trials. India's Second Wave\nIndia has been hard hit with another wave reporting up to 400,000 cases and approximately 3,000 deaths each day. Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech are some of the main Indian companies for vaccine production. This caused India to put a halt in overseas shipments. India has been administering their own vaccine known as Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, as well as their local Covishield (known as Oxford-AstraZeneca). Assistance from other nations have also been provided to slow down the spread and death rate in India. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has also recently been approved for use to aid with the dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases. The United States has agreed to fund these biotech companies with supplies for accelerated production. Approval of other global vaccines are in the process to get India immune as quickly as possible. While India faces shortages of oxygen supply, hospital beds and vaccines; places like the U.S and Australia are restricting any travelers from India into their countries to help stop the spread. This pandemic continues to have detrimental impacts on societies, environments, and the economy but it has also shown us that with science diplomacy and the sharing of knowledge, the fight against the novel coronavirus is possible.

The arquebus was later adopted by European armies during the Italian Wars of the early 16th century. This all brought an end to the dominance of armored cavalry on the battlefield. The simultaneous decline of the feudal system – and the absorption of the medieval city-states into larger states – allowed the creation of professional standing armies to replace the feudal levies and mercenaries that had been the standard military component of the Middle Ages. In Africa, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, was the first African commander to use gunpowder on the \n\nThe United States biological weapons program began in 1943 and was discontinued in 1969. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven bio-agents (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\nBacillus anthracis (anthrax)\nFrancisella tularensis (tularemia)\nBrucella spp (brucellosis)\nCoxiella burnetii (Q-fever)\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus\nBotulinum toxin (botulism)\nStaphylococcal enterotoxin B\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)—international treaties outlawing biological warfare. History\n\nEarly history (1918–1941)\nInitial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of World War I. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin ricin, a product of the castor plant. The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to shrapnel for delivery by artillery shell, was successful; the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests. Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended. Chief of the CWS, Amos Fries, decided that such a program would not be \"profitable\" for the U.S. Japan's Shiro Ishii began promoting biological weapons during the 1920s and toured biological research facilities worldwide, including in the United States. Though Ishii concluded that the U.S. was developing a bio-weapons programs, he was incorrect. In fact, Ishii concluded that each major power he visited was developing a bio-weapons program. As the interwar period continued, the United States did not emphasize biological weapons development or research. While the U.S. was spending very little time on biological weapons research, its future allies and enemies in the upcoming second World War were researching the potential of biological weapons as early as 1933.,\n\nWorld War II (1941–45)\nDespite the World War I-era interest in ricin, as World War II erupted, the United States Army still maintained the position that biological weapons were, for the most part, impractical. Other nations, notably France, Japan and the United Kingdom, thought otherwise and had begun their own biological weapons programs. That fall, U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) undertake consideration of U.S. biological warfare. He wrote to Dr. Frank B. Jewett, then president of the NAS:\n\nBecause of the dangers that might confront this country from potential enemies employing what may be broadly described as biological warfare, it seems advisable that investigations be initiated to survey the present situation and the future possibilities. In response the NAS formed a committee, the War Bureau of Consultants (WBC), which issued a report on the subject in February 1942. The British, and the research undertaken by the WBC, pressured the U.S. to begin biological weapons research and development and in November 1942 U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt officially approved an American biological weapons program. Though initially, under George Merck, the WRS contracted several universities to participate in the U.S. biological weapons program, the program became large quickly and before long it was under the full control of the CWS. Cold War (1947–1969)\nFollowing World War II, the United States biological warfare program progressed into an effective, military-driven research and production program, covered in controversy and secrecy. From the end of World War II through the Korean War, the U.S. Army, the Chemical Corps and the U.S. Air Force all expanded their biological warfare programs significantly, especially concerning delivery systems. At the trial of John W. Powell and two other defendants for sedition for reporting that the U.S. used biological weapons during the Korean War, the U.S. Attorney in the case, Robert H. Schnacke and the former Chief of the Special Operations Division at Ft. Detrick during the Korean War (and long-time U.S. Chemical Corps officer), John L. Schwab, entered sworn affidavits that the U.S. Army had the capability to use both offensive and defensive biological and chemical weapons \"during the period from January 1, 1949 through July 27, 1953.... based upon resources available and retained only within the continental limits of the United States.\" A 10 November 1969 report by the Interdepartmental Political-Military Group submitted its findings to the Nixon administration that the American BW capability was limited:\n\nField testing of the biological weapons was completed covertly and successfully with simulants and agents dispersed over wide, open areas. The first American large-scale aerosol vulnerability test occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in September 1950, using two types of bacteria (Bacillus globigii and Serratia marcescens) and fluorescent particles. Rosebury published Peace or Pestilence? In 1969, Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson argued that the biological warfare programs would eventually hurt US security because potential enemy nations could easily emulate these weapons. This included new production plants for anthrax, brucellosis, and anti-crop agents, as well as the development of the cluster bomb. The goal of the experiment, unknown to the volunteers, was to standardize tularaemia bomb-fill for attacks on civilian populations. Pathogens studied included the biological agents causing a myriad of diseases such as anthrax, glanders, brucellosis, melioidosis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and other plant and animal pathogens. The use of chemicals, riot-control agents, and herbicides like Agent Orange drew international criticism, and negatively affected the U.S. public opinion on the development of biological weapons. Jeanne Guillemin, wife of biologist Matthew Meselson, summarized the controversy:\n\nThe Nixon administration felt an urgent need to respond to the growing negative perception of biological weapons. Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as wheat stem rust, were stored at Beale Air Force Base and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Geneva Protocol and BWC\nThe 1925 Geneva Protocol, ratified by most major powers in the 1920s and 30s, had still not been ratified by the United States at the dawn of World War II. Among the Protocol's provisions was a ban on bacteriological warfare. The Geneva Protocol had encountered opposition in the U.S. Senate, in part due to strong lobbying against it by the Chemical Warfare Service, and it was never brought to the floor for a vote when originally introduced. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. Agents studied and weaponized\nWhen the U.S. biological warfare program ended in 1969 it had developed six mass-produced, battle-ready biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and botulism. In addition to the agents that were ready to be used, the U.S. program conducted research into the weaponization of more than 20 other agents. They included: smallpox, EEE and WEE, AHF, Hantavirus, BHF, Lassa fever, Coronavirus, melioidosis, plague, yellow fever, psittacosis, typhus, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever (RVF), CHIKV, late blight of potato, rinderpest, Newcastle disease, bird flu, and the toxin ricin. Besides the numerous pathogens that afflict human beings, the U.S. had developed an arsenal of anti-agriculture biological agents. These included rye stem rust spores (stored at Edgewood Arsenal, 1951–1957), wheat stem rust spores (stored at the same facility 1962–1969), and the causative agent of rice blast (stored at Fort Detrick 1965–1966). The first agent that was a candidate for development was foot and mouth disease (FMD). The eleven miscellaneous pathogens were: Blue tongue virus, bovine influenza, bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), fowl plague, goat pneumonitis, mycobacteria, \"N\" virus, Newcastle disease, sheep pox, Teschers disease, and vesicular stomatitis. Work on delivery systems for the U.S. bioweapons arsenal led to the first mass-produced biological weapon in 1952, the M33 cluster bomb. The M33's sub-munition, the pipe-bomb-like cylindrical M114 bomb, was also completed and battle-ready by 1952. Other delivery systems researched and at least partially developed during the 1950s included the E77 balloon bomb and the E86 cluster bomb. Production of cluster bomb submunitions began to shift from cylindrical to spherical bomblets, which had a larger coverage area. Development of the spherical E120 bomblet took place in the early 1960s as did development of the M143 bomblet, similar to the chemical M139 bomblet. The experimental Flettner rotor bomblet was also developed during this time period. Alleged uses\n\nKorean War\n\n \nIn 1952, during the Korean War, the Chinese and North Koreans insinuated that mysterious outbreaks of disease in North Korea and China were due to U.S. biological attacks. Despite contrary assertions from the International Red Cross and World Health Organization, whom the Chinese denounced as being dominated by US influence and thus biased, the Chinese government pursued an investigation by the World Peace Council. In eastern Europe, China, and North Korea it was widely believed that the accusations were true. A 1988 book Korea: The Unknown War, by Western historians Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, also suggested the claims might be true. In 1998, Canadian researchers and historians Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman of York University made the case that the accusations were true in their book, The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea. The book received mostly positive reviews, out of a collection of 20 reviews cited, 2 were negative, calling it \"bad history\" and \"appalling\", while others praised the authors, \"Endicott and Hagerman is far and away the most authoritative work on the subject\" and \"the most impressive, expertly researched and, as far as the official files allow, the best-documented case for the prosecution yet made\". In the same year Endicott's book was published, Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents that claimed to have revealed that the biowarfare allegation was an elaborate disinformation campaign by the communists. In addition, a Japanese journalist claims to have seen similar evidence of a Soviet disinformation campaign and that the evidence supporting its occurrence was faked. In 2001, anti-communist historian Herbert Romerstein supported Weathersby and Leitenberg, criticizing Endicott's research for using evidence provided by the Chinese government. In this program, Professor Mori Masataka investigated historical artifacts in the form of bomb casings from US biological weapons, contemporary documentary evidence and eyewitness testimonies. In September 2020, U.S. author Jeffrey Kaye published a set of declassified CIA communications reports (COMINT) that documented the responses of military units for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as they were apparently under attack by biological weapons, particularly the dropping of bacteria-laden insects. One  report from an identified Chinese military unit on February 26, 1952 said, \"yesterday it was discovered that in our bivouac area there was a real flood of bacteria and germs from a plane by the enemy. In another example, on March 6, 1952, the 23rd Brigade of the Korean People's Army sent a “long detailed… message to one of its subordinate battalions” suggesting preventive measures be taken against 'bacteria' dropped by UN aircraft, apparently in the area around Sariwon. Their nervous systems were said to have become 'benumbed. These claims are disputed, however one of the documented goals of the CIA’s Operation Mongoose was to induce crop failures in Cuba. Also in 1962, a  Canadian agricultural technician assisting the Cuban government claimed he was paid $5,000 to infect Cuban turkeys with the deadly Newcastle disease. The Cuban government alleged that U.S. covert biological warfare was responsible for this outbreak, which led to the preemptive slaughter of 500,000 pigs. Six years after the event, the newspaper Newsday, citing an anonymous former CIA agent, claimed that anti-Castro saboteurs, with at least the tacit backing of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials, introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba six weeks before the outbreak in 1971, to destabilize the Cuban economy and encourage domestic opposition to Fidel Castro. The Cuban government blamed the U.S. for a 1981 outbreak of dengue fever that sickened more than 300,000. Dengue is a vector-borne disease usually carried by mosquitoes, the same species of yellow-fever mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) utilized in Operation Big Buzz in 1955. Dengue 2 killed 158 people that year in Cuba, including 101 children under 15. Hemorrhagic Dengue 2 had not appeared in the Caribbean until this point and the two closest islands, Jamaica and Bahamas, reported no cases during this time. The fever appeared simultaneously in three separate areas (Havana, Cienfuegos, and Camagüey) hundreds of miles apart. Tensions between the two countries, coupled with confirmed U.S. research into entomological warfare during the 1950s, made these charges seem not implausible to some scientists and historians. By July 1981, Cuba was had widespread sugar cane rust, African Swine Fever, tobacco blue mold, Dengue 2, meningitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and several parasites targeting staple crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes. None of these had been present in the region before 1960. Experimentation and testing\n\nEntomological testing\n\nThe United States seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare (EW) during the Cold War. EW is a specific type of biological warfare which aims to use insects as weapon, either directly or through their potential to act as vectors. Clinical trials\nOperation Whitecoat involved the controlled testing of many serious agents on military personnel who had  consented to experimentation, and who  understood the risks involved. Vulnerability field tests\n\nIn military venues\nIn August 1949 a U.S. Army Special Operations Division, operating out of Fort Detrick in Maryland, set up its first test at The Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Operatives sprayed harmless bacteria into the building's air conditioning system and observed as the microbes spread throughout the Pentagon. The U.S. military acknowledges that it tested several chemical and biological weapons on US military personnel in the desert facility, including the East Demilitarization Area near Deseret Chemical Depot/Deseret Chemical Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, but takes the position that the tests have contributed to long-term illnesses in only a handful of exposed personnel. Often, these experiments took place in urban areas in order to test dispersion methods. Current (post-1969) bio-defense program\n\nBoth the U.S. bio-weapons ban and the Biological Weapons Convention restricted any work in the area of biological warfare to defensive in nature. In reality, this gives BWC member-states wide latitude to conduct biological weapons research because the BWC contains no provisions for monitoring or enforcement. The treaty, essentially, is a gentlemen's agreement amongst members backed by the long-prevailing thought that biological warfare should not be used in battle. In recent years certain critics have claimed the U.S. stance on biological warfare and the use of biological agents has differed from historical interpretations of the BWC. For example, it is said that the U.S. now maintains that the Article I of the BWC (which explicitly bans bio-weapons), does not apply to \"non-lethal\" biological agents. That law defined a biological agent as:\n\nany micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or bioengineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind ... According to the Federation of American Scientists, U.S. work on non-lethal agents exceeds limitations in the BWC.

There was a general increase in the size of pitched battles during this period as states grew and could wield larger standing armies using improved logistics. Firearms were introduced in Europe during the 16th century and revolutionised pitched battles due to their devastating effect when fired in sequence. Despite this, early firearms were inaccurate and slow to fire meaning that they were most effectively deployed in smaller, mobile blocks of infantry who would fire a mass of projectiles at an enemy. Due to the unreliability of these weapons these troops were supported by other groups of infantry, especially when confronted with enemy cavalry. In 16th century Italy, pike and shot infantry would have interweaving ranks of musket and pike armed soldiers to provide mobile cavalry protection. Furthermore, during this period artillery would evolve from basic stone throwers to barrelled cannons capable of mobility and more effective siege warfare. Science diplomacy is the collaborative efforts by local and global entities to solve global issues using science and technology as a base. In science diplomacy, collaboration takes place to advance science but science can also be used to facilitate diplomatic relations. This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. Plague, Yellow Fever, and Cholera \nFollowing the Congress of Vienna in 1815, a new era of international trade and cooperation began in Europe. The Habsburg Empire, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Prussia, as the victors, used their power to enforce quarantines. Outbreaks of plague and cholera in the Ottoman Empire led to the creation of the Constantinople Council of Health, which included European members. Plague was endemic to the Ottoman Empire at this point, so the Austrian Empire had a border zone with the Ottoman Empire and did not allow passage except at places where quarantine was possible. The Ottoman Empire used European knowledge to decrease the spread of disease. While quarantine became a common practice by the mid-fifteenth century, it was frequently used to further political ends. Even though it was unclear whether quarantine was effective, it was still used by European states during an outbreak of cholera in European Russia in 1830. Quarantine measures were highly impacted by commercial interests, however. The government of Louis Phillipe in France suggested international guidelines for quarantine to prevent their use for political gain. M. de Segur Dupeyron, as part of this government, studied quarantine and found that outbreaks of plague were directly tied to commerce. As such, quarantines were effective, but their unsystematic nature made them unduly oppressive. The French government took heed and spent many years attempting to arrange an international meeting. However, different nations had different goals: England and France wanted a decrease in quarantines to promote their commercial and colonial interests while Mediterranean countries wanted to maintain quarantines for their recognized public benefit. Much of the convention was spent debating whether cholera was contagious and whether quarantines were effective against cholera. The convention was signed by only France, Portugal, and Sardinia. There were a total of nine International Sanitary Conferences that focused on cholera, occurring from 1851-1894. It initially appeared in China at the end of 2002 and quickly spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The virus that causes SARS is known as SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly contagious, producing sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. WHO also utilized the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), developed for WHO by Health Canada, to improve the speed of outbreak detection and advance the response time. WHO also partnered with GOARN to dispatch teams of experts into areas heavily impacted by SARS such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. In addition, researchers from laboratories around the world shared their findings with each other in hopes of gaining better understanding of the disease to test possible vaccines for SARS. They also established and dispatched teams of specialists of multiple backgrounds to conduct on-site investigations of SARS and carried out extensive research to test SARS specimen in order to identify its cause and transmission behavior. Researchers in a 2005 journal proposed possible methods of vaccine development noting the possibility of an inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccine. They also proposed spike (S) protein, a glycoprotein component of SARS-CoV membrane, based vaccines as well as a recombinant RBD (a fragment in S protein) based vaccines. They concluded that of these methods, RBD vaccines may be the safest means of combating SARS, though no such effective vaccine currently exists. Collaboration between the U.S and China also improved after SARS as Tommy Thompson, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services visited China in October 2003 and \"signed a multiyear partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to develop a more robust public health infrastructure in China. China's overall responsiveness and preparedness to infectious disease has also significantly improved since SARS as evident by their cooperative efforts in curbing the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The importance of open collaboration was acknowledged formally in May 2003 when a resolution was adopted on SARS by delegates at the World Health Assembly; it called for the full support of all countries in combating SARS along with full transparency and steadfast reporting of requested information. A second resolution to improve International Health Regulations gave WHO the authority to take a much stronger role in case of infectious diseases that pose a threat to public health. This allowed WHO to act and respond to outbreaks using its own resources rather than waiting for official government notifications of outbreaks. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deaths\n\nMoreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014–2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others. Zika \n\nZika a flavivirus (a genus of viruses in the family of Flaviviridae) and a mosquito-borne disease first identified in monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. The first outbreak of Zika virus outside of Africa or Asia took place in 2007, within the state of Yap in Micronesia. In 2013, a large-scale Zika infection in French Polynesia and other countries and territories in the Pacific was recorded. The WHO declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following a series of global outbreaks and rising cases of neurological disorders in humans in 2015–2016. In March 2015, Zika virus was first discovered in the Americas when Brazil reported a large spike in fine, maculopapular rashes among people, soon identified as Zika virus infection. Additionally, an increase in fetal microcephaly, as well as other neurological abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. The global humanitarian response against Zika has occurred on many fronts, with much effort devoted to developing anti-Zika virus vaccines and therapeutics. In 2016, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted a human clinical trial of the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine. The WHO issued guidelines outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Framework to effectively interfere and help families, communities and countries to control Zika virus disease. The four main goals of their response plan - detection, prevention, care, and support and research - have supported national governments and communities to prevent and manage the complications of Zika virus. This plan detailed the development and distribution of MAC-ELISA testing kits to the US and the development of Trioplex rRT-PCR to detect Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viral RNA. COVID-19 \nOn December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. China did eventually share the genome sequence of COVID-19 with the global community and later accepted another offer from the WHO to send a team of scientists to help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, governments did not take it into proper consideration. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. The overall impact on society would have been less detrimental if governments had acted in collaboration with each other and scientists. Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. Scientists are publishing research findings before they are peer-reviewed and sharing other discoveries without delay. Scientists and clinicians are working to fight the epidemic by sharing data through information sharing technologies using bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, and arXiv, which allows them to share information in real time. As one researcher explains, “We are experiencing a shift towards Open Science at a speed that was previously unthinkable. It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank – an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information”\n\nAdditionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. \"To denote the ever-growing relevance of activities in this area, the term “vaccine diplomacy” has been widely used\", which \"means a set of diplomatic measures taken to ensure access to the best practices in the development of potential vaccines, to enhance bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation between countries in conducting joint R&D, and, in the case of the announcement of production, to ensure the signing of a contract for the purchase of the vaccine at the shortest term.\" Another example is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that was developed between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company. In January of 2021, the United Kingdom finally began to distribute Oxford Astra-Zeneca  Around the same time, Moderna ramped up their vaccine production to help supply the U.S government and clinical trials for the only 3 FDA-approved vaccines began. By the end of the month, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax continue their trials to get approval and South Africa suspends the Oxford Astra-Zeneca dose due to the different variants. Unfortunately, the CDC  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and FDA had put a pause on Janssen vaccine as 6 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot) have been reported. Shortly after, the European Commission (E.C) also put a halt on both J&J and Astra-Zeneca due to similar complications. Clinical Trials\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is a non-profit vaccine developed for the purpose of distribution toward lower and middle-income countries. The test’s accuracy is supported by the size of the sample group, diversity of ethnic communities and gender represented, and similarity of results between countries. Operation Warp Speed \nThe rapid development of the Coronavirus vaccine was achieved with the contribution of organizations like Operation Warp Speed (OWS) which formed contracts to fund vaccine companies in the development and distribution of vaccines. Due to the necessity of a Coronavirus 19 vaccine, the FDA approved unlicensed vaccines that adhere to the EUA standard to be utilized and OWS accelerated the development by allowing trials that would occur concurrently to be done simultaneously with mRNA and Replication-defective live-vector platforms for vaccine having the potential to be readily mass-produced. Equitable Distribution Concerns\nScience diplomacy is necessary to establish infrastructure for distributing COVAX’s vaccine to poorer countries that lack the framework to utilize the doses. The failure of the 2009 H1N1 Virus Vaccine Deployment Initiative (VDI) to allocate vaccines to countries that had difficulties with developing a deployment plan resulted in the poorest countries receiving the least aid during the pandemic. Vaccine Nationalism \nUnited Nation Resolution 74/274 allowed for the World Health Organization (WHO) to coordinate efforts for developing a Covid-19 vaccine and developed the resource sharing platform ACT-Accelerator. Vaccine Nationalism poses an obstacle to COVAX Facility's aim to equitably distribute the vaccine across the world funded by higher-income countries over concerns such as increasing cost and delaying distribution of the vaccine. Communication and Open Source Networks\nCommunication technologies have a prominent role in communication during Coronavirus 19 as laboratories and in-person research conferences were closed due to physical distancing measures. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, Oxford Uni-AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V are both viral vector vaccines. It is evident that there is inequality amongst the distribution of vaccines. This is due to the fact that demand is greater than supply. Countries mainly in Africa are seen to have the lowest rates of vaccinations due to their lack of resources, technology, and international assistance .In an effort to control the pandemic, not only is the development of the vaccine important, but the worldwide rollout of vaccines is too. India’s health crisis had led to Covax sending most of their supply over to India to help control the outbreak. The U.S company Moderna has agreed to a deal with Covax in preparing 500 million doses for rollout in 2022. While countries like Sweden have offered one million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses starting May of 2021 in the efforts to put an end to this pandemic. There were recorded cases of blood clots in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), in the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis), and in other arteries as well. As soon as these cases emerged, many countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, etc. By April 13, 2021, there were reports that within two weeks of receiving the vaccine, six women developed rare blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) accompanied with low blood platelets levels (thrombocytopenia) in which one case was fatal. Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines were resumed for use because officials have decided that the benefits outweighed the risks and that there were extremely rare chances of developing blood clots from the vaccines, which was also why none of these cases appeared during clinical trials. India's Second Wave\nIndia has been hard hit with another wave reporting up to 400,000 cases and approximately 3,000 deaths each day. Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech are some of the main Indian companies for vaccine production. This caused India to put a halt in overseas shipments. India has been administering their own vaccine known as Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, as well as their local Covishield (known as Oxford-AstraZeneca). Assistance from other nations have also been provided to slow down the spread and death rate in India. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has also recently been approved for use to aid with the dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases. The United States has agreed to fund these biotech companies with supplies for accelerated production. Approval of other global vaccines are in the process to get India immune as quickly as possible. While India faces shortages of oxygen supply, hospital beds and vaccines; places like the U.S and Australia are restricting any travelers from India into their countries to help stop the spread. This pandemic continues to have detrimental impacts on societies, environments, and the economy but it has also shown us that with science diplomacy and the sharing of knowledge, the fight against the novel coronavirus is possible.

The state funeral of King Hussein of Jordan took place in Amman on 8 February 1999. He was pronounced dead on 7 February 1999 at 11:43 AM at the King Hussein Medical Center. Illness\n\nIt was made public that King Hussein was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in July 1998. Hussein's lymphoma was of a type that responded to chemotherapy, which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. On his way back to Jordan in January 1999 after six months of treatment in the US, Hussein stopped in London. According to Jordanian government sources, Hussein stated that:\n\n“I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.“\n\nOn 25 January 1999, only six days after returning to Jordan, Hussein relapsed and was rushed back to the Mayo Clinic for a second bone marrow transplant. On 4 February 1999, Hussein was taken by helicopter to an intensive care unit at the King Hussein Medical Center, west of Amman. The palace sources said King Hussein's family had decided not to switch off his life support machine, preferring to let him die naturally. Jordanian television said in a news bulletin on Friday (5 February 1999) night that King Hussein was still under intensive care. Queen Noor and four of his five sons were at his side. His eldest son, Abdullah, who was recently named Crown Prince on 24 January 1999, was called to the hospital and, after his arrival, the king was removed from the respirator and pronounced dead. At that time, King Hussein was the longest-serving executive head of state in the world. The death of King Hussein was announced on local TV by a presenter in Arabic, \"Believing in God's will and with deep sorrow, the cabinet tells the Jordanian people and all our brothers in the Muslim world, and all our friends around the world, of the death of the dearest among men, His Hashemite Majesty, King Hussein Bin Talal the Great, king of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, dean of the House of the Prophet, whom God has chosen to be next to him and who passed to heaven at 11:43. Succession\nA few hours after Hussein's death was announced, Abdullah went before a hastily called session of the National Assembly and took the oath of office. Zaid al-Rifai, speaker of the House of Notables (Senate), opened the session with Al-Fatiha, a prayer for the dead. Funeral\n\nThe flag-draped coffin carrying the body of King Hussein accompanied by honor guard troops wearing Keffiyeh were taken on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians, many of them weeping, braved chilly winds to bid their leader farewell. Upon arrival at Raghadan Palace, the new king, Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, and the royal princes formally received the coffin. Queen Noor stood in a doorway surrounded by other royal women and watched from the gates of the cemetery as the king was buried. Dignitaries\nHundreds of dignitaries attended the funeral in the largest gathering of world leaders since the 1995 funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. At least 60 heads of state and government and 15 former leaders attended, as well as about 100 governmental representatives and some multilateral leaders. Also presented was the president of the Arab League, Samir Hosny. Hamas was present with a delegation of several representatives, led by its leader, Khalid Meshaal. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, his wife Nane Maria Annan and UNESCO Director General Koichiro Matsuura attended the funeral along with many of their colleagues such as European Union's Jacques Santer, NATO's Javier Solana, IMF's Michel Camdessus and African Union's Salim Ahmed Salim. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led the country's delegation, including Chief Rabbi Yesrael Lau and a representative of the families of seven teenage girls killed by a Jordanian soldier in 1997. The funeral also brought together enemies, including the leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh, who approached the Israeli president Ezer Weizman, praised him as a man of peace and shook his hand. It was the first time that Syrian president Hafez al-Assad and Benjamin Netanyahu were together in the same place, though they did not meet.

Chretien, who was on a ski vacation, claimed that the short notice of the funeral made it impossible for him to attend. This decision was criticized, since the news of Hussein's health was well known. Upon her arrival, Queen Sofia of Spain discovered that as a woman, she could not attend the funeral itself. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, also could not attend. They were treated as pilgrim travelers, waiting outside of the venue. International Grief and Tributes\nIn memory of Hussein's death, the governments of Jordan, India, Egypt, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Palestine, Yemen, and Syria declared periods of official mourning and flew their flags at half mast. United States President Bill Clinton said, \"He won the respect and admiration of the entire world and so did his beloved Jordan. He is a man who believed that we are all God's children, bound to live together in mutual respect and tolerance.\" UK Prime Minister Tony Blair called Hussein \"an extraordinary and immensely charismatic persuader for peace.\" The peace between our peoples will be a testament to your abiding belief in a lasting peace between the sons of Abraham. The Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides described him as \"a leader of international prestige, who contributed greatly to all efforts towards finding a solution to the Middle East problem. He was an exceptional figure, who spoke his mind and dealt with matters in such a way that Jordan, despite its many enemies, managed to survive as an independent state. He also contributed greatly to preventing war in the region.\" Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Hussein was \"invaluable to the formation of a new image of the Middle East, free of stereotypes of confrontation and enmity. Greek President Konstantinos Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis commended Hussein for having brought his country internal political stability and increased international respect. The UN General Assembly held an Emergency Special Session in \"Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan\" on the day of the funeral, where further tributes were made by UN President Didier Oppertti and the various heads of the United Nations Regional Groups.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . .

Chretien, who was on a ski vacation, claimed that the short notice of the funeral made it impossible for him to attend. This decision was criticized, since the news of Hussein's health was well known. Upon her arrival, Queen Sofia of Spain discovered that as a woman, she could not attend the funeral itself. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, also could not attend. They were treated as pilgrim travelers, waiting outside of the venue. International Grief and Tributes\nIn memory of Hussein's death, the governments of Jordan, India, Egypt, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Palestine, Yemen, and Syria declared periods of official mourning and flew their flags at half mast. United States President Bill Clinton said, \"He won the respect and admiration of the entire world and so did his beloved Jordan. He is a man who believed that we are all God's children, bound to live together in mutual respect and tolerance.\" UK Prime Minister Tony Blair called Hussein \"an extraordinary and immensely charismatic persuader for peace.\" The peace between our peoples will be a testament to your abiding belief in a lasting peace between the sons of Abraham. The Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides described him as \"a leader of international prestige, who contributed greatly to all efforts towards finding a solution to the Middle East problem. He was an exceptional figure, who spoke his mind and dealt with matters in such a way that Jordan, despite its many enemies, managed to survive as an independent state. He also contributed greatly to preventing war in the region.\" Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Hussein was \"invaluable to the formation of a new image of the Middle East, free of stereotypes of confrontation and enmity. Greek President Konstantinos Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis commended Hussein for having brought his country internal political stability and increased international respect. The UN General Assembly held an Emergency Special Session in \"Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan\" on the day of the funeral, where further tributes were made by UN President Didier Oppertti and the various heads of the United Nations Regional Groups.

Third, the effective scale-up of pilot projects requires strengthening and sometimes rebuilding of health care systems, including those charged with delivering primary care. In the past, the lack of health care infrastructure has been cited as a barrier to providing ART in the world’s poorest regions; however, AIDS resources, which are at last considerable, may be marshaled to rebuild public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa and other HIV-burdened regions—precisely the settings in which TB is resurgent. Fourth, the lack of trained health care personnel, most notably doctors and nurses, in resource-poor settings must be addressed. This personnel deficiency is invoked as a reason for the failure to treat AIDS in poor countries. In what is termed the brain drain, many physicians and nurses emigrate from their home countries to pursue opportunities abroad, leaving behind health systems that are understaffed and ill equipped to deal with the epidemic diseases that ravage local populations. The WHO recommends a minimum of 20 physicians and 100 nurses per 100,000 persons, but recent reports from that organization and others confirm that many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, fall far short of those target numbers. Specifically, more than one-half of those countries register fewer than 10 physicians per 100,000 population. In contrast, the United States and Cuba register 279 and 596 doctors per 100,000 population, respectively. Similarly, the majority of sub-Saharan African countries do not have even half of the WHO-recommended minimum number of nurses. Further inequalities in health care staffing exist within countries. Rural–urban disparities in health care personnel mirror disparities of both wealth and health.Even community health workers trained to provide first-line services to rural populations often transfer to urban districts.One reason doctors and nurses leave sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-poor areas is that they lack the tools to practice their trade there. [[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|European control in 1939 ]]The \"Scramble for Africa\" between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of Africa being controlled by a small number of European states. Racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the Berlin Agreement of 1885, with little regard to local differences. By 1905, control of almost all African soil was claimed by Western European governments, with the only exceptions being Liberia (which had been settled by African-American former slaves) and Ethiopia (later occupied by Italy in 1936). Britain and France had the largest holdings, but Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal also had colonies. As a result of colonialism and imperialism, a majority of Africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber. The introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor. Progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century. By 1977, 54 African countries had seceded from European colonial rulers. Q: Which poverty-related infectious diseases are within the scope of EDCTP funding? A: The EDCTP programme considers as poverty-related infectious diseases: HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected infectious diseases; diarrhoeal diseases; lower respiratory tract infections, as well as emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases of particular relevance for Africa, such as Ebola virus disease or yellow fever. Buruli ulcer, cysticercosis/taeniasis, chikungunya, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, foodborne trematodiases, leprosy (Hansen disease), human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniases, lymphatic filariasis, mycetoma, onchocerciasis, rabies, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, trachoma, and yaws. A: EDCTP awards three kinds of grants: Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs); Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs); and Training and Mobility Actions (TMAs). A: RIAs are ‘actions’ primarily meant for clinical research activities and clinical trials in partnership with sub-Saharan Africa aiming to increase the number of new or improved medical interventions for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other poverty-related infectious diseases, including neglected infectious diseases, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. Actions may normally include one or more clinical trials (phase I to IV) conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular phase II and/or III trials. These actions may also involve supporting activities fostering networking (within Africa and within Europe, as well as between Africa and Europe) or capacity development of researchers, institutions and sites in sub-Saharan Africa to conduct clinical trials and related research, including observational studies. Actions may involve activities of standardisation, dissemination, awareness-raising and communication, conduct of preparatory and accompanying studies, networking, coordination or support services, policy dialogues and mutual learning exercises and studies. Actions may also include complementary activities of strategic planning, networking and coordination between regional and national programmes. Actions may also involve targeted measures to maximise the public health impact of research results stemming from EDCTP-funded activities in sub-Saharan Africa by promoting their translation and supporting their uptake in policy-making, health systems and clinical practice at local, national and/or international level. In particular, CSAs will support sub-Saharan African countries in developing a robust ethical and regulatory framework for conducting clinical trials, targeting both national ethics committees (NECs) and national regulatory authorities (NRAs). Furthermore, CSAs will support regional clinical research networks in sub-Saharan Africa (“EDCTP Regional Networks”) in order to build and strengthen regional, national, institutional and individual capacities to conduct clinical trials according to ICH-GCP standards. A: TMAs are ‘actions’ primarily to foster the career development of individual junior and senior fellows from sub-Saharan Africa, through the support of training and mentorship of researchers, and the promotion of mobility of individual researchers and research staff. A: In addition to the guidance on the EDCTP website and the Horizon 2020 participant portal, there is a network of National Contact Points (NCPs) established to provide guidance, practical information and assistance on all aspects of participation in Horizon 2020. There are National Contact Points in EU countries and in many non-EU countries. Q: What disease areas are within the scope of the Calls for Proposals? Q: Some of our organisational or personal details are incorrect in EDCTPgrants. A: If you think that the submission of your proposal was not entirely successful due to a technical error within EDCTPgrants, the Coordinator may lodge a complaint through EDCTPgrants (see Section 10 EDCTP2 Grants Manual). If the proposals look very similar, for example, it is the same project but divided into country-specific proposals, then you may be asked to withdraw one or more proposals. The external experts will evaluate all proposals and may recommend withdrawal or merging of similar proposals. To uphold the principle of equal treatment, proposals at the second stage of evaluation may be excluded if they deviate substantially from the corresponding first stage proposal. Furthermore, second stage applicants will be asked to declare that their proposal is consistent with their first stage submission. Calls for Proposals based on a Research and Innovation Action (RIA) require the consortium to comprise at least three different legal entities. Two of the legal entities shall be established in two different European Participating States (see EDCTP website) and at least one of the legal entities must be established in a sub-Saharan African country. For Calls for Proposals based on a Coordination & Support Action (CSA) or a Training & Mobility Action (TMA), the requirement is at least one legal entity established in a European Participating State or a sub-Saharan African country, unless otherwise specified in the call text. Q: Which countries in Europe are EDCTP Participating States? Q: How does Brexit affect UK applicants to Horizon 2020 and EDCTP? A: Until the United Kingdom leaves the EU, EU law continues to apply to and within the UK, when it comes to rights and obligations; this includes the eligibility of UK legal entities to participate fully and to receive funding in Horizon 2020 actions including EDCTP2. If the UK withdraws from the EU during the grant period without concluding an agreement with the EU whereby UK applicants continue to be eligible, UK applicants and beneficiaries will cease to be eligible to receive EU funding (while continuing, where possible, to participate) or required to leave the project on the basis of Article 50 of the grant agreement. A: The following countries are eligible: Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo (Democratic People’s Republic), Congo (Republic), Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe. A: As from 1 January 2017 Switzerland is associated to the entire Horizon 2020 programme. This means that for all EDCTP projects for which the grant agreement is signed as from 1 January 2017 the Swiss participants are automatically eligible for funding. The status of Switzerland as an Associated Country means that Swiss entities are eligible for participation and funding in EDCTP2. Q: Can participants that are located in the European Union or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020, but not in a EDCTP Participating State (for example, Belgium) receive EDCTP funds? Q: Can legal entities established outside a sub-Saharan African country, a European Union Member State or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020 participate in EDCTP projects and receive funding? A: Researchers from anywhere in the world can participate in EDCTP proposals, working with European and sub-Saharan African partners to jointly develop knowledge, research data and leading scientific teams and networks. However, participants from outside sub-Saharan Africa, the European Union or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020 are not automatically eligible for funding and should fund their own participation in the project. This funding can be from any source. Potential participants from these countries are therefore encouraged to contact research and innovation funding organisations in their own country to seek support for their participation in EDCTP Calls for Proposals. Q: Can legal entities established outside a sub-Saharan African country, a European Union Member State or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020 coordinate an EDCTP-funded project? Legal entities established outside a sub-Saharan African country, a European Union Member State or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020 can more easily be involved as a participant, rather than as the coordinator. Q: Can an EDCTP-funded consortium subcontract and, in such a way, fund legal entities established outside a sub-Saharan African country, a European Union Member State or one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020? Subcontracting of tasks is allowed if it is necessary for the project, justified and described in the proposal, quantified in the budget and represents best value for money. Q: Can international organisations, for example the World Health Organization (WHO) participate in EDCTP-funded projects and receive funding? A: International organisations, including WHO, can participate in all consortia that apply for funding through Calls for Proposals launched by EDCTP. However, international organisations are not normally eligible for EDCTP funding, unless this is identified in advance in the EDCTP work plans and specified in the Call for Proposals, and/or where their input is deemed essential to the implementation of the project. Q: Can a private company, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), participate in EDCTP-funded projects and receive funding? It is eligible for funding provided that it is a legal entity established in either a sub-Saharan African country, a European Union Member State or in one of the Countries Associated to Horizon 2020. Q: Are US legal entities eligible to receive funding from EDCTP on the basis of the bilateral agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Commission (EC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)? A: Although EDCTP is co-funded under the Horizon 2020 framework, EDCTP operates as an independent legal entity and is therefore not part of the bilateral agreement between NIH and EC. During the grant preparation stage, organisations without a PIC will be required to provide EDCTP with official documents to verify their legal and financial status. Q: Do I have to secure cofunding from other sources in order to be eligible for EDCTP-funding? Q: Can proposed cofunding come from non-EU sources, either public or private? Experts are external to EDCTP and, in performing their evaluation(s), are working in a personal capacity rather than as a representative of any organisation or scientific community. Full details of the evaluation procedure are described in the Calls for Proposals in the ‘’Evaluation criteria, scoring and thresholds’’ section and in the EDCTP2 grants manual. A list of experts used in the evaluation is published annually. Q: How can I be sure that my understanding of expected impact and other specific terms used in the Call text is the same as that of the expert reviewers? Likewise, experts will evaluate proposals on the basis of the expected impact statements (amongst other criteria). Applicants are therefore advised to read the ‘expected impact’ statements closely in order to determine whether or not their interpretation of the term ‘expected impact’ is more or less likely to convince reviewers that the expected impact will be achieved. Q: Is it of added value at the evaluation stage if the coordinator of the project is a sub-Saharan African legal entity? Q: Is it of added value at the evaluation stage if the consortium includes a large number of partners? It is not an advantage in itself to have a large consortium unless it is required to achieve the objectives of the project. You should only include those participants whose organisations (legal entities) have confirmed their participation in the project and their commitment to sign the ‘accession forms’ to the grant agreement making them jointly and severally liable for the technical implementation of the action (see Article 41.1 of the general EDCTP2 multi-beneficiary grant agreement). The composition of the consortium cannot normally be changed during the grant preparation phase, and therefore participants must be committed from the point of submission of the proposal. A: SMEs are certainly welcome to be involved, but SMEs will not have a particular advantage over another type of organisation. In specific Calls for Proposals that request cofunding, such as ‘Strategic projects with major cofunding’, provision of cofunding is considered as part of the evaluation criteria. It is likely that some of the experts used at the first stage of evaluation will participate in the evaluation procedure at the second stage. Nevertheless, the exact composition of the group of experts may be different at each stage. How can I ensure that this information remains strictly confidential when scrutinised by external peers during the review process? Q: What sort of feedback can I expect during the course of my application? There is no rebuttal procedure at stage 1 and the individual evaluation reports are not provided to applicants. At stage 2, applicants receive the individual evaluation reports or extracts of them for rebuttal. Q: What is the expected success rate for applications to a Call for Proposals? A: There are three EDCTP Model Grant Agreements: multi-beneficiary, mono-beneficiary and mono beneficiary with options for fellowships. EDCTP Model Grant Agreements: multi-beneficiary, mono-beneficiary and mono beneficiary with options for fellowships. During the world wars, African soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries. Some African soldiers also volunteered. Veterans from Over 1.3 million African troops participated in World War II and fought in both European and Asian theatres of war. This led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination, which was left largely unfulfilled. One of the provisions added by President Roosevelt was that all people had the right to self-determination, inspiring hope in British colonies. Anticolonial politicians immediately saw it as relevant to colonial empires. After World War II, the US and the African colonies put pressure on Britain to abide by the terms of the Atlantic Charter.

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

Third, the effective scale-up of pilot projects requires strengthening and sometimes rebuilding of health care systems, including those charged with delivering primary care. In the past, the lack of health care infrastructure has been cited as a barrier to providing ART in the world’s poorest regions; however, AIDS resources, which are at last considerable, may be marshaled to rebuild public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa and other HIV-burdened regions—precisely the settings in which TB is resurgent. Fourth, the lack of trained health care personnel, most notably doctors and nurses, in resource-poor settings must be addressed. This personnel deficiency is invoked as a reason for the failure to treat AIDS in poor countries. In what is termed the brain drain, many physicians and nurses emigrate from their home countries to pursue opportunities abroad, leaving behind health systems that are understaffed and ill equipped to deal with the epidemic diseases that ravage local populations. The WHO recommends a minimum of 20 physicians and 100 nurses per 100,000 persons, but recent reports from that organization and others confirm that many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, fall far short of those target numbers. Specifically, more than one-half of those countries register fewer than 10 physicians per 100,000 population. In contrast, the United States and Cuba register 279 and 596 doctors per 100,000 population, respectively. Similarly, the majority of sub-Saharan African countries do not have even half of the WHO-recommended minimum number of nurses. Further inequalities in health care staffing exist within countries. Rural–urban disparities in health care personnel mirror disparities of both wealth and health.Even community health workers trained to provide first-line services to rural populations often transfer to urban districts.One reason doctors and nurses leave sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-poor areas is that they lack the tools to practice their trade there. [[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|European control in 1939 ]]The \"Scramble for Africa\" between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of Africa being controlled by a small number of European states. Racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the Berlin Agreement of 1885, with little regard to local differences.

Keynes said the Treaty was a \"Carthaginian peace\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. Keynes argued the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic \n\n Belgium's overtures out of hand, thus guaranteeing Luxembourg's continued independence. The main article, §40, revoked all special privileges that Germany had acquired in Luxembourg, with Germany specifically renouncing advantages gained in the treaties of 1842, 1847, 1865, 1866, February 1867, May 1867, 1871, 1872, and 1902. The effects of these treaties' revocation were then explicitly stated; Luxembourg would withdraw from the Zollverein, Germany would lose its right to use the Luxembourgish railways, and Germany was obligated to recognise the termination of Luxembourg's neutrality, thus validating the actions of the Luxembourgish government since the armistice. Furthermore, to prevent economic embargo after the end of the customs union, the treaty allowed Luxembourg an indefinite option on German coal, and prohibited Germany from levying duty on Luxembourgish exports until 1924.\n\n army, \"undefeated in the field\", had been \"stabbed in the back\" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting – later dubbed the \"November criminals\".

They especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

My Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) who was my care co-ordinator (until December 2017) and I were both pleased to have a diagnosis and I proceeded to educate myself in all things Bipolar Disorder Type 2. Before he left, my CPN had left notes to say that he disagreed with the diagnosis of Bipolar, and instead believed it was more likely that I had Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. So, what is Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder? This next section might seem a little bit encyclopaedic in nature. In the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the disorder is called ‘Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder’ (EUPD). So different professionals use the different terms to describe the same condition. I have written articles about it. I have had recognisable patterns of rapid fluctuation between times of confidence and despair. I struggle with my emotions and I struggle with social, psychological, and occupational functioning. I know understand why I do things, why I think things, and why I keep screwing up with relationships, employment, and my finances. My psychiatrist has referred me to an organisation based in Cornwall that helps those with mental health issues. I am also awaiting emotional coping skills therapy and other Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This might mean joining a gym to exercise more; eating three healthy meals a day; regulating my sleep pattern; or to come up with techniques to use in certain emotional states. In that article, I wrote about how Saltash Town Council had been debating about the future of the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how it was my belief that the argument was in the wrong, as it was about whether a male mayor’s consort could wear the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how this was a breach of the Equality Act 2010. However, it was come to my attention that the controversial issue has been reopened but without a debate being granted. Language has been something that has fascinated me for my entire life. At every level of my education studies, I have embarked upon the exploration of language and I have been interested in how language has changed over time. Language changes for many reasons, including: societal changes, technological advancements, and the influence of other languages. Contemporary times and shifting attitudes towards different sections in society has resulted in certain words becoming redundant and replaced with terms that can be used equally for a wider range of people. Policeman/police woman, landlord/landlady, actor/actress; there are, of course, many other gender specific terms that we could discuss. With the changes in language, we now refer to those working in the police as police officers. Those who own land are, in the majority, still referred to with the gender specific terms, but there has been a growing change to calling them ‘land owners’ instead. In fact, it could be argued that “gender is not a straight line… it is a spectrum”. Further to the argument surrounding gender specific terms, and how society should be proud of liberal values of equality, we come to the current issue that is being stirred back up with Saltash Town Council: the “Mayoress’ Chain”. I have been notified, by unnamed sources close to the council, that the Mayor of Saltash, Cllr John Brady, has sent an email to all councillors to inform them that he is reopening the debate that the council had less than a year ago. If you’re wondering, like I am, for the reasons behind this bizarre decision, keep reading as I will analyse the mayor’s actions later in this article. For now, I would like to keep discussing what should be the main issue here: the term “mayoress”. In 2017, Cllr John Brady was one of the main instigators behind the debate about the “Mayoress’ Chain” and the use of it by male mayor’s consorts over the last few years, when the mayor had been female (Cllr Jean Dent and, former Cllr, Hilary Frank). The argument was that the chain should not be used by male consorts as it had been originally, and historically, gifted to the town for the use of the mayoress. If a mayor’s consort is forbidden the use of the chain because of their gender, it is a form of direct discrimination. There were other arguments offered, but to me this was the main problem: you cannot exclude someone from something based purely on their gender. The term “mayoress” is outdated. It suggests that the mayor should be male and that their partner be female. Change that word, and these problems vanish. Last year, the Saltash Town Council decided to retire the “Mayoress’ Chain”. They could have renamed it, but for reasons of “historical integrity” they decided instead to have the chain retired and gifted to the local heritage centre to be put on display. This decision, therefore, literally put the chain (and, therefore, the name of the chain) where it belongs: in a museum. So Why Is The Mayor Of Saltash Making Such A Bizarre Decision? There is no other factor at play here. The Mayor is asking Council to approve the return of the Mayoresses Chain to use by the Mayoress of the day. Being 2 weeks into my term as Mayor, I have been amazed at the number of people Jackie and I have met who have asked why Jackie is not wearing the Mayoresses chain. We have responded to the question by saying it is ‘ political ‘. However, due to the interest from people we meet I feel it is reasonable to request approval for the chain to be returned to use by the Mayoress ONLY. I have discussed fully with the Town Clerk my proposal. The Town Clerk has assured me that the process is correct as it is now 6 months since the item was last considered by Full Council. A survey Monkey will be set up on Friday 25th May to run 5 days. When he has been asked for additional information regarding these sources, he had refused to give the information. Perhaps if people felt strongly enough about the “Mayoress’ Chain”, they would write to the council directly. As discussed above, the term “mayoress” denotes the use by a female partner of the sitting mayor. Declaring that the use of the chain only be that of the “mayoress” is declaring that only a female partner can wear the chain. It is excluding those of different genders and, could be argued, as excluding those people, of different sexualities than heterosexual, from putting themselves forward for the role of Mayor. Why Is The Lack Of A Debate A Dangerous Thing? As discussed, in the email quoted above, the Mayor of Saltash has decided not to allow a debate on this matter, but instead has demanded that the councillors vote on an online poll. Firstly, the online poll is fallible and could be misused by anyone with access to the link. Secondly, the lack of debate doesn’t allow for amendments to the matter, amendments that may change the use of the chain from a discriminatory one to a fair and equal one. Let’s take the first point of the poll being fallible. The source who sent me the link is not a member of the council, they are not a member of council staff, however they followed the link and they cast a vote. Therefore, the poll is at danger of being corrupted. Therefore, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. Sixteen people who have been granted their position by the people of the town of Saltash. This matter needs a debate as it can be changed to make it fairer and less discriminate. Therefore, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. The third point of this being the first step towards further acts of matters being taken to an online vote to push through unpopular matters is a dangerous one. They can be held accountable for decisions made, and they can engage in a debate that can evolve issues to better conclusions. Therefore, again, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. Write to Saltash Town Council with your views. I will be contacting Saltash Town Council to see if they would like to make a comment with regards to this article. When we examine the result of the local elections, who do you believe is the winner? In total, Labour have control of 74 councils and have a total of 2350 councillors. What is my analysis of these results? These results suggest anti-government and anti-Brexit beliefs are affecting the way that the electorate vote. Analysing the data shows that the main losses come from parties that are leading the Brexit brigade. The party in government, the Tories, has lost both councils and number of councillors. On the other hand, the parties who are against government policies and against Brexit have made gains. The Liberal Democrats, the party fighting for a referendum on the final deal for Brexit, gained control over 4 more councils and gained 75 more councillors. The Liberal Democrats have been gaining councillors and councils in by-elections since last year’s abysmal results, and now this most recent election is seeing them being the only party to gain both councils and councillors. The results just above this headline disproves that by showing losses for Tories and gains for Labour. Is “highly likely” really enough? We need evidence and a democratic decision before launching our nation into war. The Prime Minister has met with the Cabinet to discuss potential action in response to the alleged chemical weapon attack in Douma, Syria. “Highly likely” was the term used by Theresa May when blaming Russia for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Just like there is no evidence – or very little evidence – to prove that the Salisbury attack was the actions of the Russian state. Is “highly likely” enough to start a war? “Highly likely” is enough to take military action. But, why isn’t parliament being allowed to decide whether this nation goes to war? If this nation goes to war without parliament being consulted, this nation will no longer be living in a democracy. We will be living in an autocratic regime. Our elected representatives need to be presented with evidence that can prove that a chemical weapon attack took place, that the Assad regime is to blame, and that military action will stop further use of chemical weapons or an escalation to a larger war involving Syria’s allies (Russia and Iran). They then need to make the decision as a democratic body – and this needs to be done without the vote being whipped. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has announced that it agreed with the UK government on the identity of the nerve agent. They didn’t name it as “novichok” and they didn’t identify the location of the origin of the nerve agent. Boris Johnson is wrong because there are many “alternative” explanations. Just because you refuse to look for alternative explanations, it doesn’t mean that it is proof. Just because Boris Johnson and the Conservative party refuse to look for alternative explanations, it is not proof that Russia did it. This statement that the Foreign Secretary has used means that the government is still working from a hypothesis based upon prejudicial opinion and guesswork. “Only Russia has the means, motive and record” – actually, if we are talking about “means”, then perhaps we should admit that Porton Down, the UK’s chemical weapons laboratory located close to the attack site, also has developed Novichok agents. The USA is reported to have developed Novichok agents too. As for motive, what motive? The question remains, why would the Russian state want to attack a British city and target someone who was no longer a threat to them? Why would they risk this escalation towards conflict? The argument for Russia being the only one with the means and motive is rather shaky and lacking in hard facts. However, yes, there is a record of Russia using chemical weaponry against a former spy on UK soil. However, they are not the only threat to the UK that has a record of launching attacks on our cities. Simply pointing the finger of blame at the Russian state and saying they are the only ones capable of doing this, the only ones who want to do this, and the only ones with a record of doing similar things… well, it just simply isn’t good enough. However, I am someone who believes in the concept of being innocent until proven guilty. If the Foreign Secretary, and the UK government, want to continue blaming Russia, then it needs to provide evidence that proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that Russia is the guilty party. “Highly likely” is not good enough. The Foreign Secretary went on to say that the UK government has “nothing to hide”. He also said that “in the interest of transparency”, that the UK government has asked the OPCW release the executive summary of their report. Well, if the UK has “nothing to hide”, and “in the interest of transparency” can we be shown all the evidence that the government has against Russia so that this country can – without a shadow of a doubt – be confident that the government is acting in the correct and reasonable manner against the correct enemy? If not, back down until you can provide such evidence. I know how it feels to be overwhelmed with news reports about data being given away, about Zuckerberg answering ridiculous questions from politicians in the US, and about a company you had never heard of before a few weeks ago – Cambridge Analytica. I did a quick audit of accounts on Facebook and found that most of the ones that I looked at showed me enough to be able to socially engineer a way into the majority of the accounts that I looked at. I can spot ways that social engineering can be done. I can also see how small amounts of information can be used to develop a working psychological profile on the account holder. I can also see how these small amounts of information can be compared to other account holders to build up a picture of sections of society. It can easily be done, even by an amateur investigative journalist like me. So, imagine what a company with masses of resources can do. I found a substantial amount of data that I could use to socially engineer my way into the person’s life. Not only did I find out where he went to school, I also found out the level of education that he got up to. I found out names of friends he grew up with, names of teachers that had taught him, the names of pets, and information about his toddler son. I found out his job and his employment history, as well as names of colleagues. This is just information I got by clicking on his name under the comments to the above post and then clicking on the freely accessible information from his profile. He didn’t actually post his primary school name. This suggests that even those who think they are safe and are being smart online, are just as likely to be giving away vast amounts of data without even realising it. The Cambridge Analytica story involves the use of quizzes and apps on Facebook to develop a working psychological profile of users and to use this to manipulate portions of society to vote a certain way. However, there are still a large number of ‘personality’ related quizzes being used. These quizzes are used to build up a ‘personality type’ that, as discussed, can be used to build up a psychological profile to be used to give an average idea of portions of society. When you embark upon these quizzes, you usually give away your consent to use your data without you even really knowing you had done so. Example of how quizzes and apps on Facebook trick you into giving away vast amounts of data. There has also been misunderstandings where tenancy rules have forbidden anything on windows or any alterations to buildings without the landlord’s prior permission, and where this has been enforced with requests for flags to be taken down. However, these minor unrelated instances are used by groups like Britain First and UKIP to rile up the xenophobic feelings within certain sectors of society and try to convince people that there are those out there who have immigrated to the UK and who are offended by the flag. This gives the pages of groups who do such a thing a legitimacy and a mandate to continue. Not only that, but by commenting on or by sharing such a post, you have shown that you can be easily manipulated by right-wing views. If you don’t believe yourself to be racist or prejudiced in any shape or form, then I politely request that you stop commenting on, and sharing, such posts as the one above. The post is trying to get you to post with details about when/where you grew up. Turn on the reviews option for being tagged. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, or as he is most commonly known ‘Boris Johnson’, was an odd choice for Foreign Secretary when Theresa May announced her Cabinet in 2016. It wasn’t long before it became accepted that Boris Johnson was this nation’s Foreign Secretary. He continues to lie, continues to show his racist nature, is sexist, uses offensive comparisons and descriptions for people and nations, and has questionable links to the Russian state as well as a possible connection to the perpetration of electoral fraud during the referendum campaign. However, during an interview broadcast yesterday, the Chief Executive of Porton Down told Sky News that they were unable to identify the source of the nerve agent. It does mean that Porton Down scientists were unable to give the source of the nerve agent. They could not be “absolutely categorical” or absolutely sure with “no doubt” because they were unable to identify the source. He did not have a scientist at Porton Down tell him that there was “no doubt” it was Russia who was behind the attack. He misled the public into believing there was categorical proof from the Porton Down laboratory. However, they forgot the golden rule of social media: don’t post anything you wouldn’t want your electorate to later see, especially once they’ve found out that you’re lying. Or, specifically, the Foreign Secretary’s mistake. In 1988, he was fired from The Times for lying about a quote in an article (he made up the quote – a bit like making up the quote from the scientist at Porton Down). Eradicating rough sleeping in London was a failure as numbers doubled during his leadership. It should have been condemned by his leader and his party. He got away with it, apart from for some minor outrage in the press. On 28th March, it was revealed that Boris Johnson attended the launch of a local Conservative campaign that has been accused of “dog whistle racism”. The “Keep Havering Safe” campaign was launched in December 2017, and Boris Johnson was there. There should have been a firing and suspension from party. In 1997, he said that South Africa has a “majority tyranny of black rule”. Again, in 2002, he wrote that touring the Commonwealth, the Queen would be greeted by “cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies”. Again, in 2002, he wrote that on Tony Blair’s visit to the Congo “tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles”. In 2008, he wrote “Orientals … have larger brains and higher IQ scores. In 2006, he had described Barack Obama as “part-Kenyan” with an “ancestral dislike” of Britain. Any sort of racism is vile and there is no place for it in our modern fair and open society. He should never have been promoted to such a level in government and he should be instantly fired from his position. How is Boris linked to the Cambridge Analytica story? A Canadian digital firm, AggregateIQ (AIQ), was pivotal in the Vote Leave campaign. These same whistleblowers have explained how Vote Leave channelled money through the campaign BeLeave so that AIQ was paid more by the campaign than electoral laws allowed. It is all a mess and confusing, and I will write a more in-depth article once all evidence has been released, but what this means is simple: Boris Johnson is linked to a campaign that is under suspicion of breaking electoral laws and is further linked to a data company that may have broken laws to influence the referendum vote. Can two high ranking politicians really escape unscathed? They should be removed from their positions and suspended by the party until investigations can be carried out. How is Boris linked to Russia? You talk yourself into finally opening your eyes, because you now you have to get help because your heart and lungs are going to explode, you’re going to die. The problem was that I couldn’t leave my bed, so I couldn’t get across the room to the bedroom door, which meant I couldn’t make it to the bathroom, which meant I couldn’t get ready, and that meant I couldn’t do anything else with my morning – such as breakfast, a mug of tea, check the news, check social media, leave the house, walk to the health centre, see the GP – all of that, everything to do with my morning, was now impossible to do. I explained, above, what it was like waking up this morning, but maybe people think “that’s just what getting up is like, we all have it”. You get in, the water cascades around you and you wash your body and hair, yes? The very process of getting into the shower turns into a more complex mission than trying to gain peace in the Middle East. Brushing your teeth, making a mug of tea, drinking the mug of tea, walking from one room to another, going outside, answering the phone, making a call, sending a Tweet, opening a message, writing a Facebook status, checking Snapchat, talking to someone, taking medication, preparing food, anything and everything. She judged me, my own mother judged me, for what she believed was laziness. If my mother can judge me, and – without meaning to – make me feel smaller and weaker than I already was, imagine what my perception of what other people, people who know me less than my mother, would think of me. Anyway, I love my mum and she is compassionate and caring, but this was a rare moment when she didn’t understand. Regular readers will be aware that I have been leading a campaign against a particular town councillor and his desire to be mayor. I discussed my reasons why I was arguing against him, and I launched a public poll to gauge public opinion. Yesterday, during a very short extraordinary town council meeting, councillors chose to ignore public opinion and instead voted for Cllr John Brady to be the new Mayor of Saltash. The poll had been posted on many different Facebook groups and pages, all to do with Saltash, in an attempt to get as many people to take part as possible. Some were offensive, unpleasant, and discriminatory, and attempted to deride the attempt to gain a democratic viewpoint. In support of Cllr Brady, Alana Breakingbury, critical of the poll, tried to use the stigmatism of mental health against me with the rhetorical: “Is this because of his mental health issues. Lauren Challen, daughter of town councillor Gloria Challen, resorted to insults with calling the poll “petty playground behaviour”. She also argued against the human right of freedom of expression, as well as a citizen’s democratic right, by telling me to, “Get a grip, does it really matter what you think?”. Also forgetting the fact that I had resigned from the council, a decision made due to my health but also due to the unpleasant culture that a few councillors had created, Lauren Challen also commented that I had “failed to even be” a councillor and called me a “sad man with too much time on his hands”. In other words, an intelligent addition to the debate. Local resident, Teresa Lindeyer, commented, “I just wonder why an elected town councillor who is NEVER seen at civic events wants to be Mayor??! Another local resident and business owner, Hannah Hepton, said, “He has a history of making the lives of those who have worked tirelessly for Saltash in this role miserable”. Another local resident, Dave Waters, thanked me and had this to say, “Unfortunately you are against the Saltash Trumpalike” comparing Cllr Brady to President Donald Trump. Another comment on the poll is one that confirms and strengthens my concerns that this council is losing the respect of the people it is elected to represent, “Well done for putting your views across in such a clear and precise way. This comment, from local resident, Dean Blackett, first of all helped to strengthen my resolve in what I had set out to do, but also – with the final line – saddened me. People have lost faith in this current council and the public perception, outside of the circle of people who know councillors and regularly engage with them, is one of derision and distrust. In fact, on the Saltash News Network page (on Facebook), under their post announcing that Cllr Brady was the new mayor, there were many comments saying the same thing, “never heard of him”. I will continue to argue against our new mayor, who refuses to respect the council’s code of conduct, who refuses to respect the very office that he has been elected to, and who refuses to apologise when he has done wrong. I have also seen how he creates a culture of unpleasantness and stress amongst councillors. And I have seen how divisive he has been – not only in he council, but also through the town (as can be evidenced with the social media referenced to within this article). A little earlier this month, I had submitted a second complaint with the Standards Committee at Cornwall Council regarding Councillor Brady. He had refused to carry out the sanction, as instructed, by the monitoring officer. Therefore, he ignored and disrespected the accountability process; ignored and disrespected the advice/guidance of the monitoring officer; and ignored and disrespected someone he had wronged. This complaint was submitted before I knew he was standing for mayor, and was submitted in response to understanding that he had hypocritically called for the resignation of the mayor after she had been found to have broken the code of conduct. This complaint originated as a concern that I had sent to town councillors and the town clerk prior to the meeting. This, by itself, could be seen as a breach of the council’s Code of Conduct, specifically Part 5B (non-registerable interests) “ii) the interest is such that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would consider your interest so significant that it is likely to prejudice your judgement of the public interest”. In addition to this, as Cllr Challen was voted in to be the Deputy Mayor, an argument could be made that the public support could have had unfair influence upon Cllr Brady, and other councillors, to vote in favour of her nomination. Less than 24 hours since the new mayor and deputy mayor have been chosen for Saltash, and already there is controversy being uncovered. No, it is actually a sensible democratic option that should be taken seriously. Let’s first get the typical argument out of the way. People may argue that the first referendum was representative of just over half of the population, and that just over half of that electorate voted to leave. Therefore, these people may argue, the first referendum isn’t the nation speaking and that we should do the vote again! Yes, 48.8% of the population didn’t vote in the election (that’s around 32 million people) but that isn’t any reason to have another referendum and I don’t think any of the political figures are arguing for a second referendum for that reason. Another reason that people throw around is that people have changed their minds after the result. They realised the error of their ways and regretted the vote. A second referendum isn’t a referendum for ‘remoaners’ who want to try to get another referendum that will show a different result. We stand to lose a lot more as time goes on, with the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrading our growth expectations for the next five years and the Prime Minister agreeing to an EU exit bill which will cost between £35 billion and £39 billion. These passionate declarations were given without any plan of how to actually do this, or with any evidence at all that we had lost control in the first place. In fact, the Bar Council (the legal representative body) has stated that the UK “has not given up sovereignty over the terms and applications of its own laws within the United Kingdom”. It did, however, explain that with the EU, the UK has a “pooled sovereignty”, which can be compared to that of membership to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In fact, according to the Institute for Government, the UK has achieved the highest long-term rate of successful judgements out of all of the EU nations and has never been referred to the ECJ for a fine. As for defending our borders from immigration, 80% of EU migrants come into the UK with a firm job offer already in place, or actively looking for work, or to study. In fact, as argued in a previous article about the NHS, many of our industries and economy rely upon EU migrants. Who exactly are we defending our borders from? It seems like we are pushing away highly skilled workers who we desperately need. There were people on both sides who told lies, some bigger than others, and both sides didn’t really prepare the public for what it would mean either way. However, it was quite obvious that it was the Leave campaign who had the most emphasis on an emotive ‘story’ to win the vote. They used fears, stereotypes, and false promises to encourage people to want to leave. Who are coming here to work hard and save lives, but shall we talk about all the “expats” abroad…? Nobody argued about the Northern Ireland border and we didn’t choose whether to have a hard border or not. The fishery industry were misled by the Leave campaign, and now they’re upset with the deal that has been made. There are so many other examples, including how we are heading towards an economic crisis with our eyes closed and the mass exodus of businesses that has only just begun. Trade deals with other countries? The decision we made was the start of the debate. I am not talking about the soundbites that we’ve heard from the government: “Brexit means Brexit”; “red, white, and blue Brexit”, and the “bespoke economic partnership”. No, we know actual facts because the EU spokespeople aren’t as reserved as the Tory government over what their red lines are. For example, we know that if this country isn’t in the single market and customs union, then there will be a hard border for Northern Ireland (which nobody wants). We want to leave. If Parliament are granted a vote on the deal, then this would be 0.00099% of the population deciding on an issue that is far too important to leave in just their hands. It is this kind of issue that referendums were made for, and therefore, there should be a second referendum for deciding on whether the people of this country want to accept or deny the deal, and whether to proceed or to change our mind about the Brexit vote. People try to argue that a second referendum isn’t respecting democracy. But, here’s the thing that I just can’t get my head around: why is asking the public a question again not respecting democracy? Why is asking the nation to tell the politicians what they want not respecting democracy? If we’ve changed our mind due to new information or experiences, then the vote changes. So, how exactly is a second referendum non-democratic? It is the most democratic thing that could happen in this situation! What is more democratic: asking the population once, with limited information, and acting on the decision; or asking the population once, at the start of a debate, and for a second time, at the end of the debate, before acting on the decision? It is obviously more representative of a democratic society to ask a second time once all the information has been given. However, I do hear those shouting “but it disrespects the will of the people!”. We have respected the will of the people, but we need to know if the majority of the electorate still believe that the right choice is to leave. I also hear those who are saying that a second referendum would be opening up a dangerous precedent of votes not being permanent. This is scaremongering rubbish. As I’ve already argued: the first referendum was the start of the debate, the second referendum would be the end of the debate. Why wasn’t the first? Because, as I’ve argued, we have more information now. Anyway, I digress, another argument against a second referendum seems to be that it will reopen, or deepen, the divides that the first referendum created. Not just in politics, but also in our communities. Yes, divides occurred. It showed that the traditional age of politics was over and that our nation’s politics is much more diverse – as are our communities. However, I agree that the divides shown could be managed better during the second referendum. Instead of allowing emotive stories to lead the media and public, the politicians need to present the cold, hard, facts of the matter. They need to explore the actual facts and what the actual effects will be on the nation. They need to persuade the nation why it is right to either remain or to leave, based on facts. That way, a well-informed electorate will go to the polling stations and mark their voting slip with their opinion on what this nation needs to do. We will then have a final decision based on facts and knowledge, not on emotive lies and guesswork. In 2015, the electorate made a democratic decision that the Tories should remain in government, that the Lib Dems should be punished for their role in the coalition government, and that Labour should lose a massive number of seats too, and that the SNP should have more seats in Parliament. Two years after the democratic decision of what the House of Commons should look like, the public voted again and changed their mind. For several years, I worked alongside other town councillors in being responsible representatives for the people of the town. We made decisions that directly affected the lives of people, and we worked hard on projects to improve the town as a whole. I was witness to, and victim of, regular offensive and ridiculously rude email correspondence and would also witness campaigns of hatred towards leaders of the council due to petulant reasons of jealousy. In August 2017, my complaint against a councillor – who had been one of the main perpetrators of the above problems – was judged by the Cornwall Council Standards Committee, who oversee the conduct of the councils throughout Cornwall. My complaint was that the councillor had sent a series of emails that were hurtful, unpleasant to read, abusive, and failed to treat the recipient with respect. I had included that I felt bullied, intimidated, and discriminated against, with regards to my mental health and age. A ‘Decision Notice’ was administered against Saltash Town Councillor John Brady. At the time of writing this article, 219 days have passed and no apology – verbal or written – has been given by the councillor. Within the Decision Notice, the Standards Committee stated that Cllr Brady “failed to adhere to the general principles of public life” and that he had “conducted himself in a manner contrary to the Council’s statutory duty to promote and maintain high standards of conduct”. As those are the judgements of the Standards Committee, it is unclear why the elected representative has refused to apologise. There was recently a furore over what the current mayor of Saltash said in a private conversation prior to a meeting of the town council. According to the witness who complained, the mayor was heard to say a racial slur. In contradiction to this claim is the defence that the mayor, a former teacher, was having a private intellectual debate about how language has changed over time, explaining how certain words and phrases are no longer allowed. Despite this understandable defence, the Standards Committee of Cornwall Council investigated and told the mayor that she would have to apologise and attend training. The mayor has apologised multiple times and is awaiting the training. She was also the victim of an attempted coup to oust her as mayor when a group of ‘independent’ councillors (the oxymoron of a ‘group of independents’ is one that I may explore in a future article) worked together with a vote of no confidence. This seems like a straight forward issue of there being a problem and those watching over the conduct of the elected representative investigated and took action, right? If a representative decides not to do as the Standards Committee judges as the best course of action, then the Standards Committee has no power to punish that representative. The Standards Committee, which is there to oversee the councils of Cornwall and to ensure that the elected representatives are following the rules, is a shark with no teeth. He gave his opinion that the mayor should have resigned following the decision made by the Standards Committee about her wrongdoing. This is a councillor who blatantly ignored the Standards Committee when he was found to be guilty of not adhering to the “general principles of public life” and failing to conduct himself in the manner of the “Council’s statutory duty to promote and maintain high standards of conduct”. This is a councillor who ignored the recommended action of issuing an apology, which furthermore demonstrates his complete disregard to the Code of Conduct and his statutory responsibilities as an elected representative. I sent a letter to the town council asking why Cllr Brady had ignored the Decision Notice from the Standards Committee. The letter was not read out during the meeting and went largely ignored by all. I’m sure you’re wondering why the vocal group of ‘independent’ councillors, who were so adamant that the mayor should resign over a similar matter, wouldn’t be so similarly vocal over this matter. In Saltash, the town council votes for a new mayor-elect each spring. In my opinion, as someone who has watched very closely, this is an elected representative who: has failed to apologise after failing to comply with the rules regarding the conduct of councillors; creates a culture of unpleasantness and stress amongst councillors; hypocritically called for the mayor to resign; has orchestrated the votes of no confidence in the last three mayors (all of which had failed); and fails to make an appearance at many civic events. He also never attended any ‘Meet your Councillors’ events, during which members of the public could meet with councillors in the town centre to ask questions and raise issues. As mentioned, Cllr Brady has flat out refused to attend many town events. When I was the Honorary Secretary of the Saltash May Fair Committee, we had invited all councillors along to the civic parade. Cllr Brady responded saying that he was too busy to take part in the civic occasion, and to attend the community event, because he would be playing golf. I have also discovered another email, in which Cllr Brady refuses to attend the town’s remembrance service and parade because of a disagreement he had with a matter being debated. Councillor Brady has also refused to attend many of the Civic Services that have taken place over the last few years. Taking evidence of his commitment so far, it is my opinion and judgement that he won’t. Another problem that there will be for Cllr Brady, if he does become mayor, is his dislike and disrespect for a large proportion of the council and the town’s representatives to Cornwall Council. Mayors need to be able to lead and, simultaneously, give support to councillors. In an email sent on 4th May 2017, Cllr Brady said that the Liberal Democrats were “sad and sick”, as well as “smug and spiteful”. Interesting, then, to consider what kind of mayor Cllr Brady would be with almost half of the councillors on Saltash Town Council being affiliated with the Liberal Democrat party. Or will his “mission” against the Liberal Democrats stop him from being able to lead the whole council? He had followed this email with another reply where he set out his plan for the mayor to be elected by a public vote and for the mayor not be one of the elected councillors. His plan was for there to be an elected member of the community to become mayor. It saddens me to think that the town of Saltash is about to be given a mayor who doesn’t deserve to be in that much respected position. During the Napoleonic Wars the colony was captured by Britain, and British control was confirmed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna at the Treaty of Paris. After the Napoleonic Wars, large numbers of British settlers arrived in the Cape, amongst others the 1820 Settlers who, numbering some 5,000 people, were settled in the eastern parts of the colony to provide better protection against the Xhosa. Shortly after the newspaper's foundation many Dutch farmers, especially from the eastern part of the colony, dissatisfied with British rule, trekked into the interior where they set up their own republics - the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. Friction between the British authorities and the Boer republics (as they were called) escalated into the First Boer War of 1880-1881 and the Second Boer War of 1899-1902.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school world history.

South Australian law could not be applied, because the tribe had not pledged allegiance to the Crown. The controversy may have played a part in Gawler's recall some months later.

On 10 April 1841, members of the Tenkinyra tribe guided Richard Penny to a spot where they promised the remains of a drowned white man were buried. My Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) who was my care co-ordinator (until December 2017) and I were both pleased to have a diagnosis and I proceeded to educate myself in all things Bipolar Disorder Type 2. Before he left, my CPN had left notes to say that he disagreed with the diagnosis of Bipolar, and instead believed it was more likely that I had Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. So, what is Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder? This next section might seem a little bit encyclopaedic in nature. In the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the disorder is called ‘Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder’ (EUPD). So different professionals use the different terms to describe the same condition. I have written articles about it. I have had recognisable patterns of rapid fluctuation between times of confidence and despair. I struggle with my emotions and I struggle with social, psychological, and occupational functioning. I know understand why I do things, why I think things, and why I keep screwing up with relationships, employment, and my finances. My psychiatrist has referred me to an organisation based in Cornwall that helps those with mental health issues. I am also awaiting emotional coping skills therapy and other Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This might mean joining a gym to exercise more; eating three healthy meals a day; regulating my sleep pattern; or to come up with techniques to use in certain emotional states. In that article, I wrote about how Saltash Town Council had been debating about the future of the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how it was my belief that the argument was in the wrong, as it was about whether a male mayor’s consort could wear the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how this was a breach of the Equality Act 2010. However, it was come to my attention that the controversial issue has been reopened but without a debate being granted. Language has been something that has fascinated me for my entire life. At every level of my education studies, I have embarked upon the exploration of language and I have been interested in how language has changed over time. Language changes for many reasons, including: societal changes, technological advancements, and the influence of other languages. Contemporary times and shifting attitudes towards different sections in society has resulted in certain words becoming redundant and replaced with terms that can be used equally for a wider range of people. Policeman/police woman, landlord/landlady, actor/actress; there are, of course, many other gender specific terms that we could discuss. With the changes in language, we now refer to those working in the police as police officers. Those who own land are, in the majority, still referred to with the gender specific terms, but there has been a growing change to calling them ‘land owners’ instead. In fact, it could be argued that “gender is not a straight line… it is a spectrum”. Further to the argument surrounding gender specific terms, and how society should be proud of liberal values of equality, we come to the current issue that is being stirred back up with Saltash Town Council: the “Mayoress’ Chain”. I have been notified, by unnamed sources close to the council, that the Mayor of Saltash, Cllr John Brady, has sent an email to all councillors to inform them that he is reopening the debate that the council had less than a year ago. If you’re wondering, like I am, for the reasons behind this bizarre decision, keep reading as I will analyse the mayor’s actions later in this article. For now, I would like to keep discussing what should be the main issue here: the term “mayoress”. In 2017, Cllr John Brady was one of the main instigators behind the debate about the “Mayoress’ Chain” and the use of it by male mayor’s consorts over the last few years, when the mayor had been female (Cllr Jean Dent and, former Cllr, Hilary Frank). The argument was that the chain should not be used by male consorts as it had been originally, and historically, gifted to the town for the use of the mayoress. If a mayor’s consort is forbidden the use of the chain because of their gender, it is a form of direct discrimination. There were other arguments offered, but to me this was the main problem: you cannot exclude someone from something based purely on their gender. The term “mayoress” is outdated. It suggests that the mayor should be male and that their partner be female. Change that word, and these problems vanish. Last year, the Saltash Town Council decided to retire the “Mayoress’ Chain”. They could have renamed it, but for reasons of “historical integrity” they decided instead to have the chain retired and gifted to the local heritage centre to be put on display. This decision, therefore, literally put the chain (and, therefore, the name of the chain) where it belongs: in a museum. So Why Is The Mayor Of Saltash Making Such A Bizarre Decision? There is no other factor at play here. The Mayor is asking Council to approve the return of the Mayoresses Chain to use by the Mayoress of the day. Being 2 weeks into my term as Mayor, I have been amazed at the number of people Jackie and I have met who have asked why Jackie is not wearing the Mayoresses chain. We have responded to the question by saying it is ‘ political ‘. However, due to the interest from people we meet I feel it is reasonable to request approval for the chain to be returned to use by the Mayoress ONLY. I have discussed fully with the Town Clerk my proposal. The Town Clerk has assured me that the process is correct as it is now 6 months since the item was last considered by Full Council. A survey Monkey will be set up on Friday 25th May to run 5 days. When he has been asked for additional information regarding these sources, he had refused to give the information. Perhaps if people felt strongly enough about the “Mayoress’ Chain”, they would write to the council directly. As discussed above, the term “mayoress” denotes the use by a female partner of the sitting mayor. Declaring that the use of the chain only be that of the “mayoress” is declaring that only a female partner can wear the chain. It is excluding those of different genders and, could be argued, as excluding those people, of different sexualities than heterosexual, from putting themselves forward for the role of Mayor. Why Is The Lack Of A Debate A Dangerous Thing? As discussed, in the email quoted above, the Mayor of Saltash has decided not to allow a debate on this matter, but instead has demanded that the councillors vote on an online poll. Firstly, the online poll is fallible and could be misused by anyone with access to the link. Secondly, the lack of debate doesn’t allow for amendments to the matter, amendments that may change the use of the chain from a discriminatory one to a fair and equal one. Let’s take the first point of the poll being fallible. The source who sent me the link is not a member of the council, they are not a member of council staff, however they followed the link and they cast a vote. Therefore, the poll is at danger of being corrupted. Therefore, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. Sixteen people who have been granted their position by the people of the town of Saltash. This matter needs a debate as it can be changed to make it fairer and less discriminate. Therefore, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. The third point of this being the first step towards further acts of matters being taken to an online vote to push through unpopular matters is a dangerous one. They can be held accountable for decisions made, and they can engage in a debate that can evolve issues to better conclusions. Therefore, again, I would urge the Mayor of Saltash to change his decision and to allow there to be a debate and vote during a public meeting. Write to Saltash Town Council with your views. I will be contacting Saltash Town Council to see if they would like to make a comment with regards to this article. When we examine the result of the local elections, who do you believe is the winner? In total, Labour have control of 74 councils and have a total of 2350 councillors. What is my analysis of these results? These results suggest anti-government and anti-Brexit beliefs are affecting the way that the electorate vote. Analysing the data shows that the main losses come from parties that are leading the Brexit brigade. The party in government, the Tories, has lost both councils and number of councillors. On the other hand, the parties who are against government policies and against Brexit have made gains. The Liberal Democrats, the party fighting for a referendum on the final deal for Brexit, gained control over 4 more councils and gained 75 more councillors. The Liberal Democrats have been gaining councillors and councils in by-elections since last year’s abysmal results, and now this most recent election is seeing them being the only party to gain both councils and councillors. The results just above this headline disproves that by showing losses for Tories and gains for Labour. Is “highly likely” really enough? We need evidence and a democratic decision before launching our nation into war. The Prime Minister has met with the Cabinet to discuss potential action in response to the alleged chemical weapon attack in Douma, Syria. “Highly likely” was the term used by Theresa May when blaming Russia for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Just like there is no evidence – or very little evidence – to prove that the Salisbury attack was the actions of the Russian state. Is “highly likely” enough to start a war? “Highly likely” is enough to take military action. But, why isn’t parliament being allowed to decide whether this nation goes to war? If this nation goes to war without parliament being consulted, this nation will no longer be living in a democracy. We will be living in an autocratic regime. Our elected representatives need to be presented with evidence that can prove that a chemical weapon attack took place, that the Assad regime is to blame, and that military action will stop further use of chemical weapons or an escalation to a larger war involving Syria’s allies (Russia and Iran). They then need to make the decision as a democratic body – and this needs to be done without the vote being whipped. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has announced that it agreed with the UK government on the identity of the nerve agent. They didn’t name it as “novichok” and they didn’t identify the location of the origin of the nerve agent. Boris Johnson is wrong because there are many “alternative” explanations. Just because you refuse to look for alternative explanations, it doesn’t mean that it is proof. Just because Boris Johnson and the Conservative party refuse to look for alternative explanations, it is not proof that Russia did it. This statement that the Foreign Secretary has used means that the government is still working from a hypothesis based upon prejudicial opinion and guesswork. “Only Russia has the means, motive and record” – actually, if we are talking about “means”, then perhaps we should admit that Porton Down, the UK’s chemical weapons laboratory located close to the attack site, also has developed Novichok agents. The USA is reported to have developed Novichok agents too. As for motive, what motive? The question remains, why would the Russian state want to attack a British city and target someone who was no longer a threat to them? Why would they risk this escalation towards conflict? The argument for Russia being the only one with the means and motive is rather shaky and lacking in hard facts. However, yes, there is a record of Russia using chemical weaponry against a former spy on UK soil. However, they are not the only threat to the UK that has a record of launching attacks on our cities. Simply pointing the finger of blame at the Russian state and saying they are the only ones capable of doing this, the only ones who want to do this, and the only ones with a record of doing similar things… well, it just simply isn’t good enough. However, I am someone who believes in the concept of being innocent until proven guilty. If the Foreign Secretary, and the UK government, want to continue blaming Russia, then it needs to provide evidence that proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that Russia is the guilty party. “Highly likely” is not good enough. The Foreign Secretary went on to say that the UK government has “nothing to hide”. He also said that “in the interest of transparency”, that the UK government has asked the OPCW release the executive summary of their report. Well, if the UK has “nothing to hide”, and “in the interest of transparency” can we be shown all the evidence that the government has against Russia so that this country can – without a shadow of a doubt – be confident that the government is acting in the correct and reasonable manner against the correct enemy? If not, back down until you can provide such evidence. I know how it feels to be overwhelmed with news reports about data being given away, about Zuckerberg answering ridiculous questions from politicians in the US, and about a company you had never heard of before a few weeks ago – Cambridge Analytica. I did a quick audit of accounts on Facebook and found that most of the ones that I looked at showed me enough to be able to socially engineer a way into the majority of the accounts that I looked at. I can spot ways that social engineering can be done. I can also see how small amounts of information can be used to develop a working psychological profile on the account holder. I can also see how these small amounts of information can be compared to other account holders to build up a picture of sections of society. It can easily be done, even by an amateur investigative journalist like me. So, imagine what a company with masses of resources can do. I found a substantial amount of data that I could use to socially engineer my way into the person’s life. Not only did I find out where he went to school, I also found out the level of education that he got up to. I found out names of friends he grew up with, names of teachers that had taught him, the names of pets, and information about his toddler son. I found out his job and his employment history, as well as names of colleagues. This is just information I got by clicking on his name under the comments to the above post and then clicking on the freely accessible information from his profile. He didn’t actually post his primary school name. This suggests that even those who think they are safe and are being smart online, are just as likely to be giving away vast amounts of data without even realising it. The Cambridge Analytica story involves the use of quizzes and apps on Facebook to develop a working psychological profile of users and to use this to manipulate portions of society to vote a certain way. However, there are still a large number of ‘personality’ related quizzes being used. These quizzes are used to build up a ‘personality type’ that, as discussed, can be used to build up a psychological profile to be used to give an average idea of portions of society. When you embark upon these quizzes, you usually give away your consent to use your data without you even really knowing you had done so. Example of how quizzes and apps on Facebook trick you into giving away vast amounts of data. There has also been misunderstandings where tenancy rules have forbidden anything on windows or any alterations to buildings without the landlord’s prior permission, and where this has been enforced with requests for flags to be taken down. However, these minor unrelated instances are used by groups like Britain First and UKIP to rile up the xenophobic feelings within certain sectors of society and try to convince people that there are those out there who have immigrated to the UK and who are offended by the flag. This gives the pages of groups who do such a thing a legitimacy and a mandate to continue. Not only that, but by commenting on or by sharing such a post, you have shown that you can be easily manipulated by right-wing views. If you don’t believe yourself to be racist or prejudiced in any shape or form, then I politely request that you stop commenting on, and sharing, such posts as the one above. The post is trying to get you to post with details about when/where you grew up. Turn on the reviews option for being tagged. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, or as he is most commonly known ‘Boris Johnson’, was an odd choice for Foreign Secretary when Theresa May announced her Cabinet in 2016. It wasn’t long before it became accepted that Boris Johnson was this nation’s Foreign Secretary. He continues to lie, continues to show his racist nature, is sexist, uses offensive comparisons and descriptions for people and nations, and has questionable links to the Russian state as well as a possible connection to the perpetration of electoral fraud during the referendum campaign. However, during an interview broadcast yesterday, the Chief Executive of Porton Down told Sky News that they were unable to identify the source of the nerve agent. It does mean that Porton Down scientists were unable to give the source of the nerve agent. They could not be “absolutely categorical” or absolutely sure with “no doubt” because they were unable to identify the source. He did not have a scientist at Porton Down tell him that there was “no doubt” it was Russia who was behind the attack. He misled the public into believing there was categorical proof from the Porton Down laboratory. However, they forgot the golden rule of social media: don’t post anything you wouldn’t want your electorate to later see, especially once they’ve found out that you’re lying. Or, specifically, the Foreign Secretary’s mistake. In 1988, he was fired from The Times for lying about a quote in an article (he made up the quote – a bit like making up the quote from the scientist at Porton Down). Eradicating rough sleeping in London was a failure as numbers doubled during his leadership. It should have been condemned by his leader and his party. He got away with it, apart from for some minor outrage in the press. On 28th March, it was revealed that Boris Johnson attended the launch of a local Conservative campaign that has been accused of “dog whistle racism”. The “Keep Havering Safe” campaign was launched in December 2017, and Boris Johnson was there. There should have been a firing and suspension from party. In 1997, he said that South Africa has a “majority tyranny of black rule”. Again, in 2002, he wrote that touring the Commonwealth, the Queen would be greeted by “cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies”. Again, in 2002, he wrote that on Tony Blair’s visit to the Congo “tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles”. In 2008, he wrote “Orientals … have larger brains and higher IQ scores. In 2006, he had described Barack Obama as “part-Kenyan” with an “ancestral dislike” of Britain. Any sort of racism is vile and there is no place for it in our modern fair and open society. He should never have been promoted to such a level in government and he should be instantly fired from his position. How is Boris linked to the Cambridge Analytica story? A Canadian digital firm, AggregateIQ (AIQ), was pivotal in the Vote Leave campaign. These same whistleblowers have explained how Vote Leave channelled money through the campaign BeLeave so that AIQ was paid more by the campaign than electoral laws allowed. It is all a mess and confusing, and I will write a more in-depth article once all evidence has been released, but what this means is simple: Boris Johnson is linked to a campaign that is under suspicion of breaking electoral laws and is further linked to a data company that may have broken laws to influence the referendum vote. Can two high ranking politicians really escape unscathed? They should be removed from their positions and suspended by the party until investigations can be carried out. How is Boris linked to Russia? You talk yourself into finally opening your eyes, because you now you have to get help because your heart and lungs are going to explode, you’re going to die. The problem was that I couldn’t leave my bed, so I couldn’t get across the room to the bedroom door, which meant I couldn’t make it to the bathroom, which meant I couldn’t get ready, and that meant I couldn’t do anything else with my morning – such as breakfast, a mug of tea, check the news, check social media, leave the house, walk to the health centre, see the GP – all of that, everything to do with my morning, was now impossible to do. I explained, above, what it was like waking up this morning, but maybe people think “that’s just what getting up is like, we all have it”. You get in, the water cascades around you and you wash your body and hair, yes? The very process of getting into the shower turns into a more complex mission than trying to gain peace in the Middle East. Brushing your teeth, making a mug of tea, drinking the mug of tea, walking from one room to another, going outside, answering the phone, making a call, sending a Tweet, opening a message, writing a Facebook status, checking Snapchat, talking to someone, taking medication, preparing food, anything and everything. She judged me, my own mother judged me, for what she believed was laziness. If my mother can judge me, and – without meaning to – make me feel smaller and weaker than I already was, imagine what my perception of what other people, people who know me less than my mother, would think of me. Anyway, I love my mum and she is compassionate and caring, but this was a rare moment when she didn’t understand. Regular readers will be aware that I have been leading a campaign against a particular town councillor and his desire to be mayor. I discussed my reasons why I was arguing against him, and I launched a public poll to gauge public opinion. Yesterday, during a very short extraordinary town council meeting, councillors chose to ignore public opinion and instead voted for Cllr John Brady to be the new Mayor of Saltash. The poll had been posted on many different Facebook groups and pages, all to do with Saltash, in an attempt to get as many people to take part as possible. Some were offensive, unpleasant, and discriminatory, and attempted to deride the attempt to gain a democratic viewpoint. In support of Cllr Brady, Alana Breakingbury, critical of the poll, tried to use the stigmatism of mental health against me with the rhetorical: “Is this because of his mental health issues. Lauren Challen, daughter of town councillor Gloria Challen, resorted to insults with calling the poll “petty playground behaviour”. She also argued against the human right of freedom of expression, as well as a citizen’s democratic right, by telling me to, “Get a grip, does it really matter what you think?”. Also forgetting the fact that I had resigned from the council, a decision made due to my health but also due to the unpleasant culture that a few councillors had created, Lauren Challen also commented that I had “failed to even be” a councillor and called me a “sad man with too much time on his hands”. In other words, an intelligent addition to the debate. Local resident, Teresa Lindeyer, commented, “I just wonder why an elected town councillor who is NEVER seen at civic events wants to be Mayor??! Another local resident and business owner, Hannah Hepton, said, “He has a history of making the lives of those who have worked tirelessly for Saltash in this role miserable”. Another local resident, Dave Waters, thanked me and had this to say, “Unfortunately you are against the Saltash Trumpalike” comparing Cllr Brady to President Donald Trump. Another comment on the poll is one that confirms and strengthens my concerns that this council is losing the respect of the people it is elected to represent, “Well done for putting your views across in such a clear and precise way. This comment, from local resident, Dean Blackett, first of all helped to strengthen my resolve in what I had set out to do, but also – with the final line – saddened me. People have lost faith in this current council and the public perception, outside of the circle of people who know councillors and regularly engage with them, is one of derision and distrust. In fact, on the Saltash News Network page (on Facebook), under their post announcing that Cllr Brady was the new mayor, there were many comments saying the same thing, “never heard of him”. I will continue to argue against our new mayor, who refuses to respect the council’s code of conduct, who refuses to respect the very office that he has been elected to, and who refuses to apologise when he has done wrong. I have also seen how he creates a culture of unpleasantness and stress amongst councillors. And I have seen how divisive he has been – not only in he council, but also through the town (as can be evidenced with the social media referenced to within this article). A little earlier this month, I had submitted a second complaint with the Standards Committee at Cornwall Council regarding Councillor Brady. He had refused to carry out the sanction, as instructed, by the monitoring officer. Therefore, he ignored and disrespected the accountability process; ignored and disrespected the advice/guidance of the monitoring officer; and ignored and disrespected someone he had wronged. This complaint was submitted before I knew he was standing for mayor, and was submitted in response to understanding that he had hypocritically called for the resignation of the mayor after she had been found to have broken the code of conduct. This complaint originated as a concern that I had sent to town councillors and the town clerk prior to the meeting. This, by itself, could be seen as a breach of the council’s Code of Conduct, specifically Part 5B (non-registerable interests) “ii) the interest is such that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would consider your interest so significant that it is likely to prejudice your judgement of the public interest”. In addition to this, as Cllr Challen was voted in to be the Deputy Mayor, an argument could be made that the public support could have had unfair influence upon Cllr Brady, and other councillors, to vote in favour of her nomination. Less than 24 hours since the new mayor and deputy mayor have been chosen for Saltash, and already there is controversy being uncovered. No, it is actually a sensible democratic option that should be taken seriously. Let’s first get the typical argument out of the way. People may argue that the first referendum was representative of just over half of the population, and that just over half of that electorate voted to leave. Therefore, these people may argue, the first referendum isn’t the nation speaking and that we should do the vote again! Yes, 48.8% of the population didn’t vote in the election (that’s around 32 million people) but that isn’t any reason to have another referendum and I don’t think any of the political figures are arguing for a second referendum for that reason. Another reason that people throw around is that people have changed their minds after the result. They realised the error of their ways and regretted the vote. A second referendum isn’t a referendum for ‘remoaners’ who want to try to get another referendum that will show a different result. We stand to lose a lot more as time goes on, with the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrading our growth expectations for the next five years and the Prime Minister agreeing to an EU exit bill which will cost between £35 billion and £39 billion. These passionate declarations were given without any plan of how to actually do this, or with any evidence at all that we had lost control in the first place. In fact, the Bar Council (the legal representative body) has stated that the UK “has not given up sovereignty over the terms and applications of its own laws within the United Kingdom”. It did, however, explain that with the EU, the UK has a “pooled sovereignty”, which can be compared to that of membership to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In fact, according to the Institute for Government, the UK has achieved the highest long-term rate of successful judgements out of all of the EU nations and has never been referred to the ECJ for a fine. As for defending our borders from immigration, 80% of EU migrants come into the UK with a firm job offer already in place, or actively looking for work, or to study. In fact, as argued in a previous article about the NHS, many of our industries and economy rely upon EU migrants. Who exactly are we defending our borders from? It seems like we are pushing away highly skilled workers who we desperately need. There were people on both sides who told lies, some bigger than others, and both sides didn’t really prepare the public for what it would mean either way. However, it was quite obvious that it was the Leave campaign who had the most emphasis on an emotive ‘story’ to win the vote. They used fears, stereotypes, and false promises to encourage people to want to leave. Who are coming here to work hard and save lives, but shall we talk about all the “expats” abroad…? Nobody argued about the Northern Ireland border and we didn’t choose whether to have a hard border or not. The fishery industry were misled by the Leave campaign, and now they’re upset with the deal that has been made. There are so many other examples, including how we are heading towards an economic crisis with our eyes closed and the mass exodus of businesses that has only just begun. Trade deals with other countries? The decision we made was the start of the debate. I am not talking about the soundbites that we’ve heard from the government: “Brexit means Brexit”; “red, white, and blue Brexit”, and the “bespoke economic partnership”. No, we know actual facts because the EU spokespeople aren’t as reserved as the Tory government over what their red lines are. For example, we know that if this country isn’t in the single market and customs union, then there will be a hard border for Northern Ireland (which nobody wants). We want to leave. If Parliament are granted a vote on the deal, then this would be 0.00099% of the population deciding on an issue that is far too important to leave in just their hands. It is this kind of issue that referendums were made for, and therefore, there should be a second referendum for deciding on whether the people of this country want to accept or deny the deal, and whether to proceed or to change our mind about the Brexit vote. People try to argue that a second referendum isn’t respecting democracy. But, here’s the thing that I just can’t get my head around: why is asking the public a question again not respecting democracy? Why is asking the nation to tell the politicians what they want not respecting democracy? If we’ve changed our mind due to new information or experiences, then the vote changes. So, how exactly is a second referendum non-democratic? It is the most democratic thing that could happen in this situation! What is more democratic: asking the population once, with limited information, and acting on the decision; or asking the population once, at the start of a debate, and for a second time, at the end of the debate, before acting on the decision? It is obviously more representative of a democratic society to ask a second time once all the information has been given. However, I do hear those shouting “but it disrespects the will of the people!”. We have respected the will of the people, but we need to know if the majority of the electorate still believe that the right choice is to leave. I also hear those who are saying that a second referendum would be opening up a dangerous precedent of votes not being permanent. This is scaremongering rubbish. As I’ve already argued: the first referendum was the start of the debate, the second referendum would be the end of the debate. Why wasn’t the first? Because, as I’ve argued, we have more information now. Anyway, I digress, another argument against a second referendum seems to be that it will reopen, or deepen, the divides that the first referendum created. Not just in politics, but also in our communities. Yes, divides occurred. It showed that the traditional age of politics was over and that our nation’s politics is much more diverse – as are our communities. However, I agree that the divides shown could be managed better during the second referendum. Instead of allowing emotive stories to lead the media and public, the politicians need to present the cold, hard, facts of the matter. They need to explore the actual facts and what the actual effects will be on the nation. They need to persuade the nation why it is right to either remain or to leave, based on facts. That way, a well-informed electorate will go to the polling stations and mark their voting slip with their opinion on what this nation needs to do. We will then have a final decision based on facts and knowledge, not on emotive lies and guesswork. In 2015, the electorate made a democratic decision that the Tories should remain in government, that the Lib Dems should be punished for their role in the coalition government, and that Labour should lose a massive number of seats too, and that the SNP should have more seats in Parliament. Two years after the democratic decision of what the House of Commons should look like, the public voted again and changed their mind. For several years, I worked alongside other town councillors in being responsible representatives for the people of the town. We made decisions that directly affected the lives of people, and we worked hard on projects to improve the town as a whole. I was witness to, and victim of, regular offensive and ridiculously rude email correspondence and would also witness campaigns of hatred towards leaders of the council due to petulant reasons of jealousy. In August 2017, my complaint against a councillor – who had been one of the main perpetrators of the above problems – was judged by the Cornwall Council Standards Committee, who oversee the conduct of the councils throughout Cornwall. My complaint was that the councillor had sent a series of emails that were hurtful, unpleasant to read, abusive, and failed to treat the recipient with respect. I had included that I felt bullied, intimidated, and discriminated against, with regards to my mental health and age. A ‘Decision Notice’ was administered against Saltash Town Councillor John Brady. At the time of writing this article, 219 days have passed and no apology – verbal or written – has been given by the councillor. Within the Decision Notice, the Standards Committee stated that Cllr Brady “failed to adhere to the general principles of public life” and that he had “conducted himself in a manner contrary to the Council’s statutory duty to promote and maintain high standards of conduct”. As those are the judgements of the Standards Committee, it is unclear why the elected representative has refused to apologise. There was recently a furore over what the current mayor of Saltash said in a private conversation prior to a meeting of the town council. According to the witness who complained, the mayor was heard to say a racial slur. In contradiction to this claim is the defence that the mayor, a former teacher, was having a private intellectual debate about how language has changed over time, explaining how certain words and phrases are no longer allowed. Despite this understandable defence, the Standards Committee of Cornwall Council investigated and told the mayor that she would have to apologise and attend training. The mayor has apologised multiple times and is awaiting the training. She was also the victim of an attempted coup to oust her as mayor when a group of ‘independent’ councillors (the oxymoron of a ‘group of independents’ is one that I may explore in a future article) worked together with a vote of no confidence. This seems like a straight forward issue of there being a problem and those watching over the conduct of the elected representative investigated and took action, right? If a representative decides not to do as the Standards Committee judges as the best course of action, then the Standards Committee has no power to punish that representative. The Standards Committee, which is there to oversee the councils of Cornwall and to ensure that the elected representatives are following the rules, is a shark with no teeth. He gave his opinion that the mayor should have resigned following the decision made by the Standards Committee about her wrongdoing. This is a councillor who blatantly ignored the Standards Committee when he was found to be guilty of not adhering to the “general principles of public life” and failing to conduct himself in the manner of the “Council’s statutory duty to promote and maintain high standards of conduct”. This is a councillor who ignored the recommended action of issuing an apology, which furthermore demonstrates his complete disregard to the Code of Conduct and his statutory responsibilities as an elected representative. I sent a letter to the town council asking why Cllr Brady had ignored the Decision Notice from the Standards Committee. The letter was not read out during the meeting and went largely ignored by all. I’m sure you’re wondering why the vocal group of ‘independent’ councillors, who were so adamant that the mayor should resign over a similar matter, wouldn’t be so similarly vocal over this matter. In Saltash, the town council votes for a new mayor-elect each spring. In my opinion, as someone who has watched very closely, this is an elected representative who: has failed to apologise after failing to comply with the rules regarding the conduct of councillors; creates a culture of unpleasantness and stress amongst councillors; hypocritically called for the mayor to resign; has orchestrated the votes of no confidence in the last three mayors (all of which had failed); and fails to make an appearance at many civic events. He also never attended any ‘Meet your Councillors’ events, during which members of the public could meet with councillors in the town centre to ask questions and raise issues. As mentioned, Cllr Brady has flat out refused to attend many town events. When I was the Honorary Secretary of the Saltash May Fair Committee, we had invited all councillors along to the civic parade. Cllr Brady responded saying that he was too busy to take part in the civic occasion, and to attend the community event, because he would be playing golf. I have also discovered another email, in which Cllr Brady refuses to attend the town’s remembrance service and parade because of a disagreement he had with a matter being debated. Councillor Brady has also refused to attend many of the Civic Services that have taken place over the last few years. Taking evidence of his commitment so far, it is my opinion and judgement that he won’t. Another problem that there will be for Cllr Brady, if he does become mayor, is his dislike and disrespect for a large proportion of the council and the town’s representatives to Cornwall Council. Mayors need to be able to lead and, simultaneously, give support to councillors. In an email sent on 4th May 2017, Cllr Brady said that the Liberal Democrats were “sad and sick”, as well as “smug and spiteful”. Interesting, then, to consider what kind of mayor Cllr Brady would be with almost half of the councillors on Saltash Town Council being affiliated with the Liberal Democrat party. Or will his “mission” against the Liberal Democrats stop him from being able to lead the whole council? He had followed this email with another reply where he set out his plan for the mayor to be elected by a public vote and for the mayor not be one of the elected councillors. His plan was for there to be an elected member of the community to become mayor. It saddens me to think that the town of Saltash is about to be given a mayor who doesn’t deserve to be in that much respected position. During the Napoleonic Wars the colony was captured by Britain, and British control was confirmed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna at the Treaty of Paris. After the Napoleonic Wars, large numbers of British settlers arrived in the Cape, amongst others the 1820 Settlers who, numbering some 5,000 people, were settled in the eastern parts of the colony to provide better protection against the Xhosa. Shortly after the newspaper's foundation many Dutch farmers, especially from the eastern part of the colony, dissatisfied with British rule, trekked into the interior where they set up their own republics - the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. Friction between the British authorities and the Boer republics (as they were called) escalated into the First Boer War of 1880-1881 and the Second Boer War of 1899-1902.\n\n"

And indeed, since the 1990s, the field of human genomics has helped biotechnology researchers identify life-threatening diseases, slow the aging process, and create more effective drugs. Making that sweeping proposition seem credible has been a recent mission for William A. Haseltine, president and founder of the William A. Haseltine Foundation for Medical Sciences and the Arts. Haseltine has been at the vanguard of discoveries in molecular biology and the commercialization of bio­technologies for more than three decades — as a medical school professor, entrepreneur, and health-care philanthropist. In 1992, Haseltine founded Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI), one of the first biopharmaceutical companies to patent human genomic sequences for medical use. After retiring as CEO of HGSI in 2004, Haseltine focused his attention further on developing life-saving drugs and medical devices and making them accessible. Surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, with views both of Manhattan’s dense material labyrinth and the faraway Catskill Mountain greenery, we spoke of the changes that biotechnology will bring — and the uncertainties of our political, cultural, economic, and uniquely human responses. S+B: Where are the most important advances in genomics emerging? But in the long run, it is not just for humans. Through the genomic revolution we are opening up all the genomes of life for our perusal, and few people have thought through the implications. The next revolution is going to be about en­ergy, agriculture, and materials science. From the bottom of the sea at the hot sea vents, to the dirt under our city streets, there’s an enormous range of microorganisms that play fundamental roles in shaping the course of life everywhere. Now, genetic science allows re­searchers to intervene at that level. HASELTINE: Biotechnology literally means technology applied to manipulate the living world. It’s one of the oldest technologies, and its greatest successes have been in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fermentation. To give you an idea of the excitement around the use of biotechnology for energy: The Berkeley Center for Synthetic Biology received about US$1 billion in grants in 2007. But to answer your question: Plants have been fixing carbon from the atmosphere with the energy of sunlight, and converting it to fossil fuel, over the course of several hundred million years. We grow forests for wood; we have agriculture. With a combination of modern biotechnology techniques we could remove carbon from the air, turn it into a fuel, use that fuel, and return the carbon to the at­mosphere so the whole process is carbon-­neutral with respect to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We know constructive biology works because these were the methods used to produce the antimalarial drug artemisinin in both bacteria and yeast. That breakthrough, which makes artemisinin cheaper to produce and therefore affordable to the world’s poorest children, has made Keasling a leader in the field of constructive biology. S+B: You mentioned energy farming. There are a number of places in the world where huge deserts are right next to the sea. You don’t want to use arable land, and this gets us away from freshwater, too. Humanity used to burn wood for energy. They will primarily use solar and wind energy to produce electricity and fuel; they will also provide some fossil fuel energy and atomic energy. All the chemical companies are very interested in petroleum substitution and micro-materials, and the life sciences have enormous amounts to contribute to material manufacturing as well. S+B: How will basic industrial manufacturing processes be changed? S+B: What is the connection be­tween nanotechnology and biotechnology? Life and materials sciences are teaching us that we can arrange atoms in precise locations, to self-assemble and form units in small to very large sizes — replicating the manufacturing pro­cesses of nature. The basic unit would be a very tiny, submicroscopic unit embodied with the information that says, “connect A, B, C, D.” It will then, in effect, construct itself: We can make a chair, we can make a table, and we can build a house. This type of construction will probably not be available until the end of this century or the beginning of the next century. You could then create a program that says, “Make a candlestick, make a chair, and make a wall.” Ray Kurzweil describes these types of technologies in his book The Age of Intelligent Machines (MIT Press, 1992). S+B: What are the implications for food production? HASELTINE: Earth’s population is projected to rise to almost 10 billion by 2050. So the need for freshwater and land is acute; we must use our agricultural land more intensively. Most people don’t understand what plowing is for. But if you have the right combinations of environment-friendly herbicides and the agricultural crops that are resistant to those herbicides, you don’t need to plow. Once you don’t need so much nitrogen fertilizer or complex pesticides, you can get to an agriculture that is much more en­ergy efficient. And it will allow us to restore many habitats, because we’ll be using less land to grow food. S+B: What about the fears about genetically modified foods? It’s spreading in many parts of the world because of its obvious advantages. For example, meat is a highly inefficient source of protein; over the next 20 to 30 years, people will move from meat to plants as a source of protein. I’ve been in Chinese restaurants that serve something that looks like a fish with skin and scales, but it’s entirely made out of soy protein, which is a plant product. You see a chicken that looks like a chicken, it’s carved like a chicken, but it’s not a chicken. You can make foods look and taste very attractive with manipulation, which, in this case, involves a process to spin soy proteins into fibers. S+B: Do you think the bioenergy industry will move ahead faster than the pharmaceutical industry has in the last 20 years in its commercialization of genomic discoveries? People don’t usu­ally make huge breakthroughs and all of a sudden have a venture capitalist say, “OK, let’s go.” But the volatility of oil prices has made investors realize that this can be very important. I have been working very closely with the leadership of the government of India. India’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is one of its major funding agencies, has fostered an alliance between a large group of Indian scientists and our group at Berkeley. We’re planning to [form similar alliances] with scientists in South America and China. S+B: How challenging will it be to create the infrastructures for producing and distributing bioenergy? HASELTINE: Constructive biology has the opportunity to produce power and transportation fuels that are fully compatible with our existing infrastructure or system. We might not need as many re­fineries, but we will still need the tankers, pipelines, and transport system. But can we build the infrastructure at the large scale that will allow us to produce fuel from them? I think the engineering problem is going to be solved, but there has to be a business motive to do that, and the motive will depend on the cost of energy and its environmental impacts. S+B: Most people, of course, still think of biotech as medical innovation. If medicine isn’t personal, and isn’t therefore personalized, then it’s not really useful. When people talk about personalized medicine they tend to focus on genetic inheritance, be­cause it is fascinating to peer into your genetic past and present. With very few exceptions, such as Huntington’s disease, you can’t say that if you have an inherited trait you’ll get the related disease. Ninety percent of breast cancer seems to have nothing to do with inherited genes. If I seem negative, it isn’t because I think genetics is unimportant. It is just that genetic inheritance is a very minor aspect of genomics, whereas the applications that I’ve already outlined — energy, agriculture, and materials — are here and important now. HASELTINE: There is no question that our knowledge has been helpful. S+B: Do you think advances in differential diagnosis will improve the pharmaceutical industry’s return on R&D in terms of profits and human health benefits? Meanwhile, productivity has de­creased by about a factor of 10. This is probably the biggest productivity collapse the world has ever seen, and it affects the whole industry, biotechnology companies included. I’ve been an advisor to many pharmaceutical companies, and I’ve set up several biotech companies, so I have a triangulated view. Drug after drug fails to create a mass market, or a drug gets approved when it shouldn’t and then gets withdrawn because of side effects. One solution would be to create “virtual” pharmaceutical com­pany structures, where you have many small companies with access to capital and scientists who understand the medical needs. Those drugs will go into the mass market, but you will have drugs selling at a much lower margin. S+B: You mentioned the breakthrough in creating an antimalarial drug that will be affordable to populations who need it most. Can we expect the next wave of medical and green genomics to reach more of the two-thirds of the world’s people who live at the “bottom of the pyramid,” in lower-income countries? HASELTINE: When the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Indians all joined the global econ­omy. C.K. Prahalad’s The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty through Profits [Wharton School Publishing, 2004] was one of the first books to recognize this. What is about to happen, and is already happening in India, is a reorientation of business toward the 2 billion people worldwide who are emerging from poverty. S+B: And it’s not just about selling consumer goods to them. The rest of the world is going to want energy, more food and better food, and good medicine. The structures that we currently have in place cannot deliver all of those things to so many people without destroying our world. Agriculture needs to be much more efficient. There is a tremendous savings to be had in promoting a vegetarian diet, and I think the world will move in that direction. I am working in India now through a foundation I’ve created to deliver high-quality, cost-efficient health care. (See “The Innovation Sandbox,” by C.K. There are a number of experimental enterprises using technology to create high-quality, af­fordable, low-cost health care for the Indian middle and lower-middle classes. These are self-sustaining, profitable organizations. The common theme is, How do you solve the problems of getting high-quality health care at very low cost to very large numbers of people? India is a great laboratory, because of its demographics and mix of high-tech wealth and poverty. S+B: Are you saying that the innovations spawned by biotechnologies can help eliminate the “have” and “have-not” economic extremes? HASELTINE: You’ll never see an end to economic disparity, but you will see unprecedented upward mo­bility in the developing world. We are already seeing something like 35 million to 40 million people a year moving into India’s and China’s middle classes. Think of it as a quarter of the United States’ total pop­ulation joining the middle class each year. Remember, it was middle- to lower-middle-income Amer­­icans, not the upper class, that drove the world economy until very recently. Mass markets are very powerful, even when the price points are low. So we’re seeing these huge transformations take place, and I think that they can continue, but we need to solve the production problems in order to make these lifestyles sustainable on our planet. S+B: Can industrial society be sustainable when there are nearly 10 billion people on the planet?\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school world history. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\nA.

Drug after drug fails to create a mass market, or a drug gets approved when it shouldn’t and then gets withdrawn because of side effects. One solution would be to create “virtual” pharmaceutical com­pany structures, where you have many small companies with access to capital and scientists who understand the medical needs. Those drugs will go into the mass market, but you will have drugs selling at a much lower margin. S+B: You mentioned the breakthrough in creating an antimalarial drug that will be affordable to populations who need it most. Can we expect the next wave of medical and green genomics to reach more of the two-thirds of the world’s people who live at the “bottom of the pyramid,” in lower-income countries? HASELTINE: When the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Indians all joined the global econ­omy. C.K. Prahalad’s The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty through Profits [Wharton School Publishing, 2004] was one of the first books to recognize this. What is about to happen, and is already happening in India, is a reorientation of business toward the 2 billion people worldwide who are emerging from poverty. S+B: And it’s not just about selling consumer goods to them. The rest of the world is going to want energy, more food and better food, and good medicine. The structures that we currently have in place cannot deliver all of those things to so many people without destroying our world. Agriculture needs to be much more efficient. There is a tremendous savings to be had in promoting a vegetarian diet, and I think the world will move in that direction. I am working in India now through a foundation I’ve created to deliver high-quality, cost-efficient health care. (See “The Innovation Sandbox,” by C.K. There are a number of experimental enterprises using technology to create high-quality, af­fordable, low-cost health care for the Indian middle and lower-middle classes. These are self-sustaining, profitable organizations. The common theme is, How do you solve the problems of getting high-quality health care at very low cost to very large numbers of people? India is a great laboratory, because of its demographics and mix of high-tech wealth and poverty. S+B: Are you saying that the innovations spawned by biotechnologies can help eliminate the “have” and “have-not” economic extremes? HASELTINE: You’ll never see an end to economic disparity, but you will see unprecedented upward mo­bility in the developing world. We are already seeing something like 35 million to 40 million people a year moving into India’s and China’s middle classes. Think of it as a quarter of the United States’ total pop­ulation joining the middle class each year. Remember, it was middle- to lower-middle-income Amer­­icans, not the upper class, that drove the world economy until very recently. Mass markets are very powerful, even when the price points are low. So we’re seeing these huge transformations take place, and I think that they can continue, but we need to solve the production problems in order to make these lifestyles sustainable on our planet. S+B: Can industrial society be sustainable when there are nearly 10 billion people on the planet?\n\n"
