The Court has held that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) requires member states to provide legal recognition, but does not require marriage to be opened to same-sex couples. In Schalk and Kopf v Austria (24 June 2010), the European Court of Human Rights decided that the European Convention on Human Rights does not oblige member states to legislate for or legally recognise same-sex marriages. However, the Court, for the first time, \n\n to the determination in 2018 that the case had been incorrectly dismissed after review by a single judge on the grounds that, \"the conditions of admissibility laid down in articles 34 and 35 of the Convention [had] not been met.\" Upon review the committee concluded that the applicants's human rights had been violated under article 18 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee dismissed the notion of \"living together\" as a vague notion not protected under international law. Under the Optional Protocol, the government of France has been given opportunity to respond before the committee finalises their decision. Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was \"unkind and inhumane\", and not in Evans' best interests. The case was commented on by the Pope via Twitter, who stated his \"sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.\" He restated his support after the removal of life support, saying \"Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\" On 23 April, Alfie was granted Italian citizenship under the request of Brothers of Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni. Legal proceedings \n\nOn 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. Alder Hey claimed that continuing life-support treatment would not be in the best interests of Alfie and sought declaration that it \"is not lawful that such treatment continue\". In their judgement, the High Court stated that an MRI scan taken in February 2018 revealed that \"[Alfie's] brain [was] entirely beyond recovery\" and that \"the brain was now only able to generate seizure\" with \"progressive destruction of the white matter of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\" The Court noted that the medical consensus, including of doctors asked to testify by the parents, was that Alfie had a fatal and untreatable condition, but they differed over the best course of action concerning his end-of-life care. High Court judge Mr Justice Anthony Hayden concluded that \"I am satisfied that continued ventilatory support is no longer in Alfie's best interest\". On 6 March 2018, the Court of Appeal upheld the earlier ruling of the High Court. On 28 March 2018 the European Court of Human Rights ruled the case inadmissible, finding no violation of human rights. The High Court backed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by medical specialists attached to Alfie Evans's case. High Court judge Hayden dismissed that complaint, and appeal judges upheld his decision.

        "context": " Over the years, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has handled cases that challenged the lack of legal recognition of same-sex couples in certain member states. The Court has held that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) requires member states to provide legal recognition, but does not require marriage to be opened to same-sex couples. In Schalk and Kopf v Austria (24 June 2010), the European Court of Human Rights decided that the European Convention on Human Rights does not oblige member states to legislate for or legally recognise same-sex marriages. However, the Court, for the first time, \n\n to the determination in 2018 that the case had been incorrectly dismissed after review by a single judge on the grounds that, \"the conditions of admissibility laid down in articles 34 and 35 of the Convention [had] not been met.\" Upon review the committee concluded that the applicants's human rights had been violated under article 18 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee dismissed the notion of \"living together\" as a vague notion not protected under international law. Under the Optional Protocol, the government of France has been given opportunity to respond before the committee finalises their decision. Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was \"unkind and inhumane\", and not in Evans' best interests. The case was commented on by the Pope via Twitter, who stated his \"sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.\" He restated his support after the removal of life support, saying \"Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\" On 23 April, Alfie was granted Italian citizenship under the request of Brothers of Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni. Legal proceedings \n\nOn 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. Alder Hey claimed that continuing life-support treatment would not be in the best interests of Alfie and sought declaration that it \"is not lawful that such treatment continue\". In their judgement, the High Court stated that an MRI scan taken in February 2018 revealed that \"[Alfie's] brain [was] entirely beyond recovery\" and that \"the brain was now only able to generate seizure\" with \"progressive destruction of the white matter of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\" The Court noted that the medical consensus, including of doctors asked to testify by the parents, was that Alfie had a fatal and untreatable condition, but they differed over the best course of action concerning his end-of-life care. High Court judge Mr Justice Anthony Hayden concluded that \"I am satisfied that continued ventilatory support is no longer in Alfie's best interest\".
