        "origin_prompt": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nBackground:Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People usually only get chickenpox once. Since its introduction in 1995, the varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease. Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and shingles worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of \"chicken\" in the name, one being the relative mildness of the disease. This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases. Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection. Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to spread via the placenta and infection of the fetus. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years. Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of chickenpox is primarily based on the signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. Prevention\n\nHygiene measures\nThe spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to drying, heat and detergents. Vaccine\n\nChickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. A live attenuated varicella vaccine, the Oka strain, was developed by Michiaki Takahashi and his colleagues in Japan in the early 1970s. In 1981, Merck & Co. licensed the “Oka” strain of the varicella virus in the United States, and Maurice Hilleman's team at Merck invented a varicella vaccine in the same year. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Being exposed to chickenpox as an adult (for example, through contact with infected children) may boosts immunity to shingles. So it was thought, that when the majority of children are vaccinated against chickenpox, adults might lose this natural boosting, so immunity would drop and more shingles cases would occur. On the other hand, current observations suggest that exposure to children with varicella is not a critical factor in the maintenance of immunity. Multiple subclinical reactivations of varicella zoster virus may occur spontaneously and, despite not causing clinical disease, may still provide an endogenous boost to immunity against zoster. It is part of the routine immunization schedule in the US. This is to keep the virus in circulation thereby exposing the population to the virus at an early age, when it is less harmful, and to reduce the occurrence of shingles in those who have already had chickenpox by repeated exposure to the virus later in life. In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an enzyme immunoassay. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease. Antivirals are sometimes used. Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known. Epidemiology\nPrimary varicella occurs in all countries worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. In temperate countries, chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It is one of the classic diseases of childhood, with most cases occurring in children up to age 15. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly transmissible, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In the tropics, chickenpox often occurs in older people and may cause more serious disease. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require state health departments to report infections of chickenpox, and only 31 states currently volunteer this information. However, in a 2013 study conducted by the social media disease surveillance tool called Sickweather, anecdotal reports of chickenpox infections on Facebook and Twitter were used to measure and rank states with the most infections per capita, with Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois in the top three. Society and culture\nEtymology\nHow the term chickenpox originated is not clear but it may be due to it being a relatively mild disease. It has been said to be derived from chickpeas, based on resemblance of the vesicles to chickpeas, or to come from the rash resembling chicken pecks.

Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People usually only get chickenpox once. Since its introduction in 1995, the varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease. Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and shingles worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of \"chicken\" in the name, one being the relative mildness of the disease. This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases. Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection. Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to spread via the placenta and infection of the fetus. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years. Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of chickenpox is primarily based on the signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. Prevention\n\nHygiene measures\nThe spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to drying, heat and detergents. Vaccine\n\nChickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. A live attenuated varicella vaccine, the Oka strain, was developed by Michiaki Takahashi and his colleagues in Japan in the early 1970s. In 1981, Merck & Co. licensed the “Oka” strain of the varicella virus in the United States, and Maurice Hilleman's team at Merck invented a varicella vaccine in the same year. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Being exposed to chickenpox as an adult (for example, through contact with infected children) may boosts immunity to shingles. So it was thought, that when the majority of children are vaccinated against chickenpox, adults might lose this natural boosting, so immunity would drop and more shingles cases would occur. On the other hand, current observations suggest that exposure to children with varicella is not a critical factor in the maintenance of immunity. Multiple subclinical reactivations of varicella zoster virus may occur spontaneously and, despite not causing clinical disease, may still provide an endogenous boost to immunity against zoster. It is part of the routine immunization schedule in the US. This is to keep the virus in circulation thereby exposing the population to the virus at an early age, when it is less harmful, and to reduce the occurrence of shingles in those who have already had chickenpox by repeated exposure to the virus later in life. In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an enzyme immunoassay. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease. Antivirals are sometimes used. Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious viral infection. Chickenpox can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in children. Once a person is infected with chickenpox, they typically develop symptoms within 10 to 21 days. Chickenpox is generally a mild illness in children, but it can cause more severe complications in certain populations, such as adults, pregnant women, newborns, and individuals with weakened immune systems. These complications may include bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and, rarely, liver or lung problems. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent chickenpox. The varicella vaccine is recommended for all children and adults who have not had chickenpox in the past. Vaccination not only helps protect individuals from getting chickenpox but also reduces the risk of complications and helps prevent the spread of the virus in the community. In conclusion, chickenpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus.

Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease. Antivirals are sometimes used. Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known. Epidemiology\nPrimary varicella occurs in all countries worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. In temperate countries, chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It is one of the classic diseases of childhood, with most cases occurring in children up to age 15. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly transmissible, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In the tropics, chickenpox often occurs in older people and may cause more serious disease. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require state health departments to report infections of chickenpox, and only 31 states currently volunteer this information. However, in a 2013 study conducted by the social media disease surveillance tool called Sickweather, anecdotal reports of chickenpox infections on Facebook and Twitter were used to measure and rank states with the most infections per capita, with Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois in the top three. Society and culture\nEtymology\nHow the term chickenpox originated is not clear but it may be due to it being a relatively mild disease. It has been said to be derived from chickpeas, based on resemblance of the vesicles to chickpeas, or to come from the rash resembling chicken pecks. Other suggestions include the designation chicken for a child (i.e., literally 'child pox'), a corruption of itching-pox'', or the idea that the disease may have originated in chickens. Samuel Johnson explained the designation as \"from its being of no very great danger\". Intentional exposure\nBecause chickenpox is usually more severe in adults than it is in children, some parents deliberately expose their children to the virus, for example by taking them to \"chickenpox parties\". Repeated exposure to chickenpox may protect against zoster. Other animals\nHumans are the only known species that the disease affects naturally. However, chickenpox has been caused in other primates, including chimpanzees and gorillas.

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious viral infection. Chickenpox can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in children. Once a person is infected with chickenpox, they typically develop symptoms within 10 to 21 days. Chickenpox is generally a mild illness in children, but it can cause more severe complications in certain populations, such as adults, pregnant women, newborns, and individuals with weakened immune systems. These complications may include bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and, rarely, liver or lung problems. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent chickenpox. The varicella vaccine is recommended for all children and adults who have not had chickenpox in the past. Vaccination not only helps protect individuals from getting chickenpox but also reduces the risk of complications and helps prevent the spread of the virus in the community. In conclusion, chickenpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure against chickenpox, as it helps protect individuals and reduce the spread of the virus. Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People usually only get chickenpox once. Since its introduction in 1995, the varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease. Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and shingles worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of \"chicken\" in the name, one being the relative mildness of the disease. This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases. Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection. Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to spread via the placenta and infection of the fetus. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years. Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of chickenpox is primarily based on the signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. Prevention\n\nHygiene measures\nThe spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to drying, heat and detergents. Vaccine\n\nChickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. A live attenuated varicella vaccine, the Oka strain, was developed by Michiaki Takahashi and his colleagues in Japan in the early 1970s. In 1981, Merck & Co. licensed the “Oka” strain of the varicella virus in the United States, and Maurice Hilleman's team at Merck invented a varicella vaccine in the same year. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Being exposed to chickenpox as an adult (for example, through contact with infected children) may boosts immunity to shingles. So it was thought, that when the majority of children are vaccinated against chickenpox, adults might lose this natural boosting, so immunity would drop and more shingles cases would occur. On the other hand, current observations suggest that exposure to children with varicella is not a critical factor in the maintenance of immunity. Multiple subclinical reactivations of varicella zoster virus may occur spontaneously and, despite not causing clinical disease, may still provide an endogenous boost to immunity against zoster. It is part of the routine immunization schedule in the US. This is to keep the virus in circulation thereby exposing the population to the virus at an early age, when it is less harmful, and to reduce the occurrence of shingles in those who have already had chickenpox by repeated exposure to the virus later in life. In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an enzyme immunoassay. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease.

Garrett, in this house the 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton, spent the first four years of his life, having been born on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. The house was owned by Clinton's maternal grandparents, Edith Grisham and James Eldridge Cassidy, and they cared for him when his mother, Virginia, was away working as an anesthetist in New Orleans. On May 19, 1994, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as \"Bill Clinton Birthplace\"). Tours were offered by the Clinton Birthplace Foundation. Bill Clinton and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar formally dedicated the site on April 16, 2011. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative—the Clinton health care plan—failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women.\n\n"

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes. Pharming, a portmanteau of \"farming\" and \"pharmaceutical\", refers to the use of genetic engineering to insert genes that code for useful pharmaceuticals into host animals or plants that would otherwise not express those genes, thus creating a genetically modified organism (GMO). History\n\nThe first recombinant plant-derived protein (PDP) was human serum albumin, initially produced in 1990 in transgenic tobacco and potato plants. Open field growing trials of these crops began in the United States in 1992 and have taken place every year since. Many companies went bankrupt as companies faced difficulties getting permits for field trials and investors fled. In reaction, APHIS introduced more strict regulations for pharming field trials in the US in 2003. A compromise was reached, but Ventria withdrew its permit to plant in Missouri due to unrelated circumstances. The industry has slowly recovered, by focusing on pharming in simple plants grown in bioreactors and on growing GM crops in greenhouses. In 2006 Dow AgroSciences received USDA approval to market a vaccine for poultry against Newcastle disease, produced in plant cell culture – the first plant-produced vaccine approved in the U.S. In mammals\n\nHistorical development\nMilk is presently the most mature system to produce recombinant proteins from transgenic organisms. In February 2009 the US FDA granted marketing approval for the first drug to be produced in genetically modified livestock. Patentability issues\nAs indicated above, some mammals typically used for food production (such as goats, sheep, pigs, and cows) have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called pharming. Use of genetically modified goats has been approved by the FDA and EMA to produce ATryn, i.e. These products \"produced by turning animals into drug-manufacturing 'machines' by genetically modifying them\" are sometimes termed biopharmaceuticals. An argument can be made for the patentability of the process for manufacturing a biopharmaceutical, however, because genetically modifying animals so that they will produce the drug is dissimilar to previous methods of manufacture; moreover, one Supreme Court decision seems to hold open that possibility. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the recent Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus may create a problem in that, in accordance with the ruling in that case, \"it may be said that such and such genes manufacture this protein in the same way they always did in a mammal, they produce the same product, and the genetic modification technology used is conventional, so that the steps of the process 'add nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present. In plants\nPlant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), also referred to as pharming, is a sub-sector of the biotechnology industry that involves the process of genetically engineering plants so that they can produce certain types of therapeutically important proteins and associated molecules such as peptides and secondary metabolites. However, human error could still result in pharm crops entering the food supply. Grain crops are sometimes chosen for pharming because protein products targeted to the endosperm of cereals have been shown to have high heat stability. Most commonly, plant transformation is carried out using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These frugal organisms can be cultivated in bioreactors (as opposed to being grown in fields), secrete the transformed proteins into the growth medium and, thus, substantially reduce the burden of protein purification in preparing recombinant proteins for medical use. In addition, both species can be engineered to cause secretion of proteins with human patterns of glycosylation, an improvement over conventional plant gene-expression systems. Biolex Therapeutics developed a duckweed-based expression platform; it sold that business to Synthon and declared bankruptcy in 2012. Regulation\n\nThe regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops – including those used for pharming – between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. Controversy\n\nThere are controversies around GMOs generally on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, issues concerning intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally. There are also specific controversies around pharming. Advantages\nPlants do not carry pathogens that might be dangerous to human health. On the other hand, plants are still sufficiently closely related to animals and humans that they are able to correctly process and configure both animal and human proteins. Expanding the existing microbial systems, although feasible for some therapeutic products, is not a satisfactory option on several grounds. These pharmaceutical crops could become extremely beneficial in developing countries. Diseases such as measles and hepatitis lead to deaths in countries where the people cannot afford the high costs of vaccines, but pharm crops could help solve this problem. Disadvantages\nWhile molecular farming is one application of genetic engineering, there are concerns that are unique to it. In the case of genetically modified (GM) foods, concerns focus on the safety of the food for human consumption. In response, it has been argued that the genes that enhance a crop in some way, such as drought resistance or pesticide resistance, are not believed to affect the food itself. Other GM foods in development, such as fruits designed to ripen faster or grow larger, are believed not to affect humans any differently from non-GM varieties. In contrast, molecular farming is not intended for crops destined for the food chain. Considerable attention is focused, therefore, on the restraint and caution necessary to protect both consumer health and environmental biodiversity. The fact that the plants are used to produce drugs alarms activists. They worry that once production begins, the altered plants might find their way into the food supply or cross-pollinate with conventional, non-GM crops. These concerns have historical validation from the ProdiGene incident, and from the StarLink incident, in which GMO corn accidentally ended up in commercial food products. Activists also are concerned about the power of business. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in a recent report, says that U.S. demand alone for biotech pharmaceuticals is expanding at 13 percent annually and to reach a market value of $28.6 billion in 2004. \"'Dow Agrosciences used the animal vaccine as an example to completely run through the process.

Reading aloud to students who are learning English as a foreign language is a highly effective strategy to assist them in learning the basic rules and understandings of the process of reading. When teachers read aloud to their students, they simply model fluency and comprehension, while also adding visual support, periodic paraphrasing, and extension. The chapter initially presents several major ideas that are developed more systematically later on in the book. That, besides the content developed, also demonstrates a teaching tool, a model of student centered discussion. In the story the author undertakes an artistic study of the process of formation of the child, starting from the moment of awareness of himself as a person, fixing the main stages of understanding of the world around him. The hero of the story grew up in prison, his first impressions of childhood firmly imprinted spatial reference points, which in the conditions of limited senses became the fundamental basis of his worldview.\n\n"
