The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations. At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such \n\nA test device and method are provided for determining the hemoglobin content of blood. The method of comparison may be performed by visual matching of colors or by instruments which measure light absorbance of the sample at defined wavelengths. Unfortunately, these methods are often time consuming and require bulky equipment which must be consistently cleaned and maintained to produce reliable results. Still another procedure is described by T. W. Tallqvist in Z. Klin. Attempts to quantify the Tallqvist procedure instrumentally by applying light absorption techniques or more recently light reflectance measurements have not been successful due to relatively large margins of error encountered in light absorbance or reflectance measurements. 3,764,480, provide means for detecting surface bacteria by reflectance measurements. While it is known that the light reflectivity of a surface, i.e., the ratio of the light emission reflected from a surface to the whole incident light emission thereon, is related to the physical property and the light absorptive and scattering properties of the surface media and to the refractive indices of the media through which the light must pass, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reflectivity is a complex phenomenon which is further complicated by the addition of a light absorbing substance, such as blood containing highly colored hemoglobin. The use of a matrix having an index of refraction close to or equal to that of a blood sample does not substantially improve the precision of light reflectance measurements. Matrix refractive indices below about 1.0 or above about 1.7 to 1.8 are significantly different from the refractive index of blood to provide improved precision of light reflectance measurements. Such matrices may contain such materials as the white or light colored metals, metallic carbonates, oxides and sulfides which are insoluble in and unreactive with water or blood. In one preferred mode of the present invention, the matrix is prepared by incorporating an opaque, light reflecting substance on or within a blood absorbent member by various well-known methods which include impregnating an absorbent material with a solvent mixture, suspension or emulsion of the light reflecting substance. Thereafter, the impregnated matrix is dried, thus incorporating on or within the matrix a finely divided, intimate, uniform mixture of the light reflecting substance. Suitable, light reflecting substances which may be used in this invention are substantially opaque and have an index of refraction significantly different from blood. Such materials include the white or light colored powdered metals, metallic carbonates, oxides and sulfides which are insoluble in and unreactive with water or blood serum. Specific examples of such materials and their mean refractive indices, at sodium D-line (589 nm) unless otherwise stated, are aluminum metal powder (0.78 at 434 nm), silver metal powder (0.18), lead carbonate (1.99), lead oxide (2.61), titanium dioxide (2.64), zinc oxide (2.02), zinc sulfide (2.37), zirconium oxide (2.17) and the like. Preferably, the light reflecting substance is incorporated on or within the absorbent member at a concentration which provides a light reflectance of between 30 and 70% of the incident light when the impregnated matrix is saturated with a blood sample, as the optimum precision in reflectance measurement occurs in this range. In addition to the above light reflecting substance which actively participates in the measurement of hemoglobin content, further components, such as water soluble binders and wetting agents, may also be optionally included in the test device of the present invention. Thus, it may be useful in some instances to incorporate a thickening agent to bind the light reflecting substance to the absorbent member. Surfactants, such as detergents, may also be added to improve the wetting properties of the matrix and promote hemolysis of the erythrocytes of blood, thus improving the homogeneity of the sample throughout the matrix and improving the precision of light reflectivity measurement. The light reflected from the blood saturated surface is then measured using any reflectance meter capable of measuring diffuse reflectance at a fixed wavelength between about 300 and 620 nanometers (nm) with a sufficient resolution, precision, and stability to allow reflectance measurements to be made which will provide a determination to within about ±0.5 g of hemoglobin per 100 ml. The intensity of the light reflectance from the blood saturated matrix is inversely proportional to the amount of hemoglobin present in the blood sample. Although the time for making the reflectance reading is not critical, the reading should be made before evaporation of moisture causes changes in hemoglobin concentration. This is preferably accomplished by interposing an air venting layer between the matrix member and the carrier member. The following illustrative examples are provided to further describe the invention but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. This example illustrates a typical preparation of the test device of this invention and the method of using the same. The emulsion was prepared by mixing about 1000 cubic centimeters (cc) of water with the titanium dioxide in an ultrasonic agitator to aid in the dispersion of the titanium dioxide. The methyl ethyl cellulose was dissolved in about 200 cc of water on a heated magnetic stirrer and then added to the titanium dioxide suspension. In addition, strips of 0.005 cm (0.002 in) polyester plastic sheet material, such as polystyrene terephthalate, 0.76 cm by 30.48 cm (0.3 in by 12 in), to be used as an air venting layer; strips of double-faced adhesive tape, 1.016 cm by 30.48 cm (0.4 in by 12 in); and strips of a flexible plastic sheet material, such as polystyrene, 0.018 cm by 9.53 cm by 30.48 cm (0.007 in by 3.75 in by 12 in) to be used as a carrier support member, were also prepared. Light reflectance from the major exposed surface of each blood saturated matrix was then measured at 620 nm using a light reflectance instrument. The light reflectance measurements were found to vary linearly with variations in the hemoglobin content of the blood samples tested. This example illustrates the prior art Tallqvist method and device using a quantitative measurement of reflectance. Light reflectance from the surface of the blood saturated matrices was measured at 620 nm with a rapid scanning reflectance spectrophotometer. This example illustrates an attempt to use the multilayer analytical device described in German Offenlegunschrift No. The presence of the constituent is determined by spectrophotometric reflectance measurements which are taken through the translucent substrate. Solution 1 was used to apply a film of 0.025 cm (0.010 in) thickness on a film substrate of 0.01 cm (0.004 in) thickness. Solution 2 was used to apply a 0.025 cm (0.01 in) film over the first layer and dried to form a second layer. Solution 3 was used to apply a 0.025 cm (0.010 in) film over the first and second layers and dried to form a third layer. Light reflectance from the upper surface of the blood saturated multilayer pieces was measured at 620 nm with a rapid scanning reflectance spectrophotometer.

The method of claim 1 in which the light reflected from said test device is measured within about 0.5 to about 3 minutes after the blood sample contacts said test device. A test device for determining the hemaglobin content of a blood sample to an accuracy of about ± 0.5 grams of hemaglobin per 100 milliliters of the blood sample by a reflected light measurement made at a wavelength between about 300 and about 620 nanometers within about 0.5 and about 3 minutes after the blood sample is applied to said test device, which test device comprises a substantially opaque, light reflective, blood absorbent matrix having a refractive index of less than about 1.0 or above about 1.7 which is prepared by incorporating a blood absorbent member with a substantially opaque light reflecting substance selected from the class of white or light colored materials consisting of powdered metals, metallic carbonates, metallic oxide and metallic sulfides which are insoluble in and unreactive in said blood sample at a concentration providing a light reflectance of between about 30 and 70 percent of the incident light when the matrix is saturated with said blood sample, said test device including means for venting air from said blood absorbent matrix. A test device according to claim 3 wherein the opaque light reflecting substance is titanium dioxide. Dichroic filters use the principle of thin-film interference, and produce colors in the same way as oil films on water. When light strikes an oil film at an angle, some of the light is reflected from the top surface of the oil, and some is reflected from the bottom surface where it is in contact with the water. Because the light reflecting from the bottom travels a slightly longer path, some light wavelengths are reinforced by this delay, while others tend to be canceled, producing the colors seen. In a dichroic mirror or filter, instead of using an oil film to produce the interference, alternating layers of optical coatings with different refractive indices are built up upon a glass substrate. The interfaces between the layers of different refractive index produce phased reflections, selectively reinforcing certain wavelengths of light and interfering with other \n\n in the sub-surface\" during the 'top kill' effort. Environmental groups share MacDonald's concern, fearing that the drilling of relief wells or the original well failure may have fractured the sea floor, allowing oil to escape. In January 2013, the sheen grew to more than seven-miles long and one-mile wide according to aerial observations made by former NASA physicist Bonnie Schumaker, who observed \"patches of rainbow and weathered mousse\" in the sheen. Samples of the sheen on several occasions \"have consistently found the presence of alpha olefiens, which is a chemical bond signature of a man-made chemical you would not find in pure crude form.\" those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.
