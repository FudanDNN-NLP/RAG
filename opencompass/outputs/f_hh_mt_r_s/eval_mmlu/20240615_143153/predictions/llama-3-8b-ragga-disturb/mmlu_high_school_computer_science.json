They are the building blocks of digital images and can be thought of as individual dots of color or light. Each pixel contains specific information about its color and intensity, and when combined with other pixels, they create the overall image. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels it contains. Pixels are used in digital images to represent visual information. When you view an image on a digital screen, such as a computer monitor or smartphone display, you are seeing a collection of pixels that have been arranged to form the image. Each pixel contributes to the overall appearance and detail of the image. By varying the color and intensity of individual pixels, a wide range of colors and shades can be displayed, creating a realistic representation of the original subject. Additionally, pixels are used to calculate various image properties, such as sharpness, contrast, and brightness. Understanding how pixels work is essential in digital image processing, as it allows for manipulation and editing of images. By modifying the values of individual pixels, you can adjust the color, brightness, and other visual attributes of an image. Techniques such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters rely on the manipulation of pixels to achieve the desired effects. Overall, pixels play a central role in the creation, display, and modification of digital images. A method for generating time independent images of moving objects with the image information being related to properties of the moving objects represented by sequences of digital images. The images are transformed into a series of space-time representations of the image data. A function is derived from the space-time representation images that approximates the object motion and is used to create time independent images of the moving objects. The present invention relates to a method for generating time independent images of moving objects where the image information is related to properties of the moving object represented by parametric values. To make sure that erroneous samples are not introduced into the dataset, the sequence has to be reviewed frame by frame; when the ROI falls outside the tissue, it must be moved manually on the wall. Sometimes this procedure can be performed automatically with methods that depend from the software available. In most cases, these methods are based on standard edge detection algorithms or on cross-correlation alignment methods (Pratt, 1991); however, these techniques do not guarantee the accuracy of the results which must still be verified manually because they incorporate no information about the structure and the geometry of the object that is recognized. In another method, the brightness of an echographic image is evaluated along pixels that are aligned on an ideal segment crossing the moving object; for example, crossing the myocardium and having an origin and an end outside the myocardium. This is done for several successive images so that the variation with time of the brightness of each pixel along the ideal segment can be simultaneously represented for all times in a two-dimensional representation where one axis is the distance along the segment and the other axis is the time. Particularly relating to the example pertaining to the perfusion, a certain number of frames are extracted as representing a certain number of digital images from a echo-contrast recording during myocardial perfusion. In order to obtain valuable and comparable numeric data, an appropriate parametric curve is fitted to the measured data to obtain corresponding perfusion parameters. An object of the present invention is to provide an enhanced method for imaging the parameters of a tissue relating to a certain tissue property using the method according to the prior art as disclosed above and allowing at the same time to build an image in which the parameter value of each pixel or group of pixels is represented by a certain kind of appearance of the pixel or of the group of pixels and in which each pixel or group of pixels is represented in a pixel array in the correct or approximately correct spatial relation to the other pixels or groups of pixels as their spatial relation exists in the real object. The present invention achieves the above-mentioned aims by means of a method for generating time independent images of moving objects with the image information being related to properties of the moving object represented by providing a sequence of two- or three-dimensional digital images of an object in motion. The image information of the image sequence is transformed into a series of space-time representations of the image data, such as the value of a variable affecting the pixel appearance for each pixel or group of pixels positioned on a series of adjacent line-segments, so called “transmural cuts”, which line-segments are positioned in such a way as to cross the moving object or the moving part of the object and are distributed in such a way as to cover the entire moving object or the entire moving part of the object. Each space-time image of each transmural cut related to different images of the sequence is aligned in order to compensate for the motion of the object along the transmural cuts by translating and/or scaling each image along the same transmural cut at certain times relative to the other images taken at other times of the image sequence, in order to shift the images of the sequence along the same transmural cut which are taken at different times essentially for a distance corresponding to the displacement of the moving object or of the moving part of the object at the transmural cut and at a corresponding time. An evaluation function is defined, having at least one parameter, and calculating for each pixel or group of pixels the value of the parameter for best fit of the evaluation function with the curve representing the values of the pixel or group of pixels as a function of time obtained from the aligned space time images. A parametric image is constructed by defining a pixel appearance scale univocally or uniquely correlated to the parameter value obtained by the best fitting of the evaluation function and by giving to each pixel or group of pixels along each transmural cut a pixel appearance related to the corresponding calculated value of the parameter. In particular, the present invention provides for a method of acquiring a sequence of a certain number of digital images of a region of interest of an object which has at least one part performing a cyclic or oscillatory or non-oscillatory motion. A certain number of pixels or groups of pixels is defined along that segment line and an image is generated for each of the pixels along the segment-line and each of the images are printed or visualized together side by side in the correct time sequence, thus forming a two dimensional image defined by two axes where one axis is the distance along the line-segment, i.e. The motion of the part of the object is compensated by aligning relative to time the single adjacent images of the pixels or group of pixels along the line-segment being taken at different times by shifting and/or stretching relative to the distance axis the position of the pixels or group of pixels along the line for each image along the line-segment taken at different times. The pixel data, such as brightness or the like, obtained from the digital image of each pixel or group of pixels along the line-segment is retrieved and represents the pixel data in a two-dimensional image defined by two axes where one axis is the pixel data, such as brightness, and the other axis is time. The parameters of the estimation function leading to the best fit of the estimation function with the time dependent data obtained from the images are calculated. The preceding steps are repeated for each pixel or group of pixels along each of the further line segments. A scale of pixel appearance is defined which is univocally or uniquely related to the values of at least one parameter and which defines different appearances of the pixels or group of pixels. An image is reconstructed in which each pixel is positioned on its segment-line in its corresponding position, and the segment-lines are correctly positioned one with respect to the other and in which each pixel has a pixel appearance corresponding to the value calculated for at least one parameter of the pixel or group of pixels. According to the method of the invention, it is possible to evaluate the appropriate parameter or parameters for each pixel of the sequence of digital images such as, for example, an echographic loop, and it is possible to build new images with the graphic representation of such parameters. This kind of imaging is defined in the present specification as parametric imaging and is the synthesis of a sequence of digital images such as, but not limited to, an echographic loop, into a few parametric images where a parametric image is a representation of a parametric quantity, or a mathematical parameter, extracted from the analysis pixel by pixel, or of group of pixels, of the evolution of a moving tissue property. Parametric imaging can be extended to moving objects, such as tissues or any other kind of objects, of which digital images have been taken with any kind of imaging method. The digital images may be acquired as echographic images or as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images. A first difficulty comes from the fact that each pixel does not correspond (often not even approximately) to the same tissue region during the physiological motion and is overcome by the method according to the present invention which, with the pixel alignment step, also allows separation of the time component by giving an image of the moving object or of a part of the moving object frozen relative to time. The method according to the present invention allows continuous tracking in time not only of parts of an object which perform motions inside a two-dimensional digital image, but also inside three-dimensional representations (images or volume data sets). After the wall is recognized, it is straightforward to analyze the time evolution of properties in correspondence to the detected wall. The pixel values considered can be the brightness of a black and white image or one or more of the variables of a color image. The alignment of the images along a segment-line at different times to freeze the motion of an imaged moving object can be carried out according to several methods known from the art. Another way is to use contour recognition algorithms. As an estimation function to be fitted with the data obtained from the images, i.e. the pixel value or values such as brightness, hue, saturation, or color, it is suggested from literature of tissue perfusion to use an exponential function of the form y(t)=A(1−e−Bt), where y(t) is the pixel value depending on time, t is the time at which the pixel value was obtained in the image, and A and B are two parameters. The parameters can be imaged into different images built according to the parametric imaging method of the present invention, with both able to be imaged into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image. The value scale for imaging the different values of the parameters A and or B can be a color scale, which relates different colors to different pixel values or which relates different brightness or saturation values to a unique color for different pixel values. Reconstructing the image according to the above-disclosed method would lead to an image comprising pixels only along each of the different line-segments distributed over the image area of the object and being at a certain distance one from the other. According to a further embodiment, interpolation algorithms can be used to define pixel values for the pixel of the image lying between two adjacent line-segments by considering the pixel values along each of the two adjacent line-segments. So instead of reconstructing a partial image, the entire pixel array or image area can be used for imaging the parameters. Considering that the parametric image has to be used in order to carry out comparisons with the parametric images of other objects, parametric imaging allows the carrying out of a simple visual analysis by comparing images and also the quantitative comparison of numerical data in a pixel, a group of pixels, or a specific region of interest. 1 is an example of an echographic image of the myocardium. 3 is a schematic drawing representing the image according to FIG. 4 illustrates an image representing the space-time dependence of the image along one transmural cut. 5 illustrates the image according to FIG. 6 and 7 are schematic diagrams representing the images of FIGS. 4 and 5, in which four selected pixels Pi,1 to Pi,4 along the transmural cut are illustrated at four different times. 8 illustrates a diagram representing the relation between the brightness of one group of pixels in the images of FIGS. 9 illustrates an image generated according to the present invention, in which the value of each pixel along each of the transmural cuts represents the value of one of the parameters of the best fit curve by means of a univocal pixel appearance scale. 10 is a three-dimensional image generated according to the present invention analogous to the image of FIG. 11 is a schematic representation of the image according to FIG. 9, an appearance corresponding to the calculated parametric values correlated to the parametric value of the pixels. For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated herein and specific language will be used to describe the same. Any alterations and further modifications in the described processes, systems or devices, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. 1 illustrates a digital image 10 obtained by echographic imaging of a heart 12. As a first step of the method according to the present invention, a certain number of images or frames are taken at different successive times in order to have a time dependent image sequence. There is no limit to the number of images in the sequence due to the fact that the method leads to results with a small error and that the method does not take much calculation or imaging time to be carried out. This applies also for the number of transmural cuts 20 which are distributed over the area of the region of interest as illustrated in FIG. In order to have a more precise idea of the steps of the method according to the invention, the image of FIG. 2 has been represented in a schematic way with a drawing which is illustrated in FIG. For each of the transmural cuts 20, a sequence of images will be acquired and registered. Along each transmural cut 20, a certain number of pixels are selected. Also, this selection is taken according to the needs of the precision of the image. It depends merely on the resolution which is wanted in the final image. In the example of the schematic drawings of FIGS. 3, 6, 7 and 11, the pixels have been chosen far away from each other in order to better appreciate the way of working of the method. This situation does normally not correspond to the real situation where the pixels are more closely spaced one to the other. Furthermore, it has to be noted that depending on the property which is examined, it might be useful to consider groups of pixels instead of single pixels, so the definition “pixel” is always to be intended as comprising also the term “group of pixels”. In the example of FIG. 3, a specific transmural cut TCi is illustrated along which the pixels Pi,1 to Pi,4 have been illustratively shown in order to better explain the method according to the present invention. It is to be further noted that although the figures are directed to an example considering echographic images of a biological object such as a heart, the method according to the present invention can be applied to any kind of digital image of any kind of moving object which has properties capable of being described by parameters. Thus each pixel has a different brightness with different concentrations of the contrast agent in the tissue of the myocardium, i.e. 4 represents an image where the image data taken along a certain transmural cut, in this case transmural cuts TCi, is taken at different times and is positioned one beside the other in the correct time sequence. The vertical axis 26 represents the position d of the pixels along the transmural cut as taken from the origin of the transmural cut, while the horizontal axis 28 represents time t.\nFIG. 6 is a drawing simplifying the image of FIG. The position of the pixels is illustrated with reference to four different times T1 to T4, which are chosen spaced one from the other for better understanding purposes. As it is shown in FIG. The sequence of images along the transmural cut has a double time dependence. One dependence is related to the changing of the perfusion of contrast agent in the myocardium, which affects the brightness of the pixels, and the other dependence is due to the motion of the myocardium. In order to eliminate the second time dependence, the method according to the present invention carries out an alignment step with respect to the time of the single pixel images. In this case, the step will produce a vertical shift of the pixel images at the different times which will align each of the four different pixels related to an image at a certain time with the corresponding pixel on each other image occurring at different times. Another solution calculates the vertical shift parameter for each pixel at different times by using a barycentre function of the undulated image of FIGS. The result of this operation is illustrated in the image of FIG. 5, which is a real image of an example, and in the drawing of FIG. 7, which relates to the simplified schematic diagram of FIG. The time-dependent space image obtained for each transmural cut is shown as a frozen image of the myocardium with respect to its motion, but which still contains the time dependence of the brightness values of the pixels. In this case, the time dependence of the brightness of the pixels on the transmural cut TCi have been plotted or represented. According to a further step, for each pixel Pi,k of each transmural cut TC1, the said above-mentioned steps are carried out, and furthermore for each pixel Pi,k of each transmural cut TC1, the parameters of an estimation function giving the best fit of the estimation function with the time dependence curve of the pixel brightness is calculated. 8 is also illustrated as line 36 in FIG. By carrying out this parameter computation step for each pixel of each transmural cut, there are obtained a certain number of pixels Pi,k having a defined position relative to one another and having a univocally or uniquely related pair of best fit parameters Ai,k and Bi,k. The position is precisely defined by the position of the transmural cut TCi in the pixel array of the image and by the position of the pixels Pi,k on the transmural cut TCi. The computed value of the parameters Ai,k and Bi,k for each pixel Pi,k can be brought into a univocal or unique relationship with a pixel value corresponding to a scale of different pixel appearances. For example, this scale might consider a certain frequency range with definite frequency steps based on the color of the pixels, which vary with the variation of the value of the parameters. Another way of rendering visible the parameter value is to chose for each parameter a certain color and defining a step-like or continuous brightness scale of that color which is related uniquely to the parameter value. Any kind of combination of the variables commonly used for defining the pixel appearance in a digital image formed by an array of pixels may be used in order to create a pixel appearance scale uniquely related to the parameter values. As a last step of the method of the present invention, an image is reconstructed by printing or visualizing each pixel Pi,k along each transmural cut TCi in the corresponding position of a pixel array, that is in the position as defined by the position of the transmural cut TCi and by the position of the pixel Pi,k along the corresponding transmural cut, and by giving to each pixel Pi,k an appearance relating to its values, for example color, brightness, or any kind of appearance defined by any kind of combination of variables defining pixel appearance which are uniquely related to the value of the parameter Ai,k and/or Bi,k of the related pixel Pi,k. 9 and for the parameter Bi,k in the three-dimensional image of a myocardium 42 shown in FIG. 11 is a drawing which shows the construction of the image illustrated in FIG. 9, 10, and 11 that giving to the pixels Pi,1, Pi,2, Pi,3, and Pi,4 a position as defined by the corresponding transmural cut TCi and by the position of the pixel on the transmural cut TCi, an image of the myocardium can be constructed in which each pixel has an appearance which is univocally or uniquely related to the value of the parameter Ai,k and/or Bi,k calculated for each pixel. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the term “echographic image” does not refer exclusively to an echographic image but also to an image frame. The sequence of echographic images can also be interpreted as a sequence of image frames. This is important since often echographic images are obtained by acquisition of a certain number of frames which are then combined to form a single image. In the case of a moving object which is to be imaged, it is preferable to use as a sequence of images a sequence of image frames. 10 shows the same result as FIGS. In fact, the method of the present invention associates numerical, quantitative parameter values to each pixel that are commonly best visualized in color-scale images, but which can also be represented in different ways. The present invention contemplates modifications as would occur to those skilled in the art. It is also contemplated that processes embodied in the present invention can be altered, rearranged, substituted, deleted, duplicated, combined, or added to other processes as would occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention.

The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) quantization, which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input (lossy compression). The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application. Tissue types could be discriminated by utilizing a combination of fuzzy k-means cluster analysis and a supervised classification algorithm based on a linear discriminant analysis. The spectral classification is compared and contrasted with the histological stained image. The 15-fold Cassegrainian objective with a numerical aperture of 0.4 imaged a sample area of ∼270×270 μm2. The pixel binning reduces the spatial resolution to ∼ 170 μm. A reference spectroscopic image was recorded from the pure calcium ﬂuoride window. Spectra at a resolution of 8 cm−1 of the sample image were rationed against the spectra of the reference image and transferred to absorbance values. The frame rate of the focal plane detector was 3773 Hz, yielding a total measurement time of approximately 20 s for each individual spectroscopic image. The main part of the data analysis is based on in-house written programs, in particular for data preprocessing and image processing. The flow chart of the data processing is sketched in Fig. Data preprocessing involves a removal of outliers, a linear two-point baseline correction, and a normalization of each absorbance value of a spectrum to the integral absorbance. Both tissues were used to train the classification algorithm to find the discriminatory spectral patterns in the data set. As it can be expected, the color coded bright field infrared image of the marked area [see Fig. 2d, which shows the fingerprint region (950 to 1750 cm−1) used for the data analysis. For every pixel the integral intensity across the spectral range 950 to 1750 cm−1 is transformed to a rainbow-scale. Red and yellow pixels in the upper right corner indicate an artifact of the thin section. Figure 3 depicts the top four principal components that cover more than 98% of the total variance of the spectroscopic image. Significant features of the PCs are displayed in the loading plots. First four principal components of the spectroscopic data set. In spectroscopic data sets, however, overlapping of clusters as well as noise and outliers are common. (a) Assignment of clusters, (b) Cluster centroid spectra. 2) is mainly represented by red, orange, and yellow pixels. However, there are also a considerable number of yellow to red pixels in this region. One approach to improve the classification accuracy is the application of the supervised methods.23 Supervised classification allows to categorize the questionable pixels into different themes, based on the spectral characteristics of tumor and normal tissue. Since violet and blue clusters in Fig. Figure 6a shows the classification result. The probability of the class assignment is transferred into a blue-dark gray-yellow color scale. Spectra that could not be assigned to one of the classes are represented as blue-gray or yellow-gray pixels. Gray pixels indicate spectra used for the training set. Pixels that have a probability of more than 60% as a tumor are colored in yellow and merged with the H&E stained image. The image fusion in Fig. Gray pixels were selected to form the training set and are not classified. The highlighted regions are those identified by the classification algorithm as informative in classifying the spectra into the two classes.

        "context": "Pixels are small cells of information that form the matrix of a digital image on a computer monitor screen. They are the building blocks of digital images and can be thought of as individual dots of color or light. Each pixel contains specific information about its color and intensity, and when combined with other pixels, they create the overall image. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels it contains. Pixels are used in digital images to represent visual information. When you view an image on a digital screen, such as a computer monitor or smartphone display, you are seeing a collection of pixels that have been arranged to form the image. Each pixel contributes to the overall appearance and detail of the image. By varying the color and intensity of individual pixels, a wide range of colors and shades can be displayed, creating a realistic representation of the original subject. Additionally, pixels are used to calculate various image properties, such as sharpness, contrast, and brightness. Understanding how pixels work is essential in digital image processing, as it allows for manipulation and editing of images. By modifying the values of individual pixels, you can adjust the color, brightness, and other visual attributes of an image. Techniques such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters rely on the manipulation of pixels to achieve the desired effects. Overall, pixels play a central role in the creation, display, and modification of digital images. A method for generating time independent images of moving objects with the image information being related to properties of the moving objects represented by sequences of digital images. The images are transformed into a series of space-time representations of the image data. A function is derived from the space-time representation images that approximates the object motion and is used to create time independent images of the moving objects. The present invention relates to a method for generating time independent images of moving objects where the image information is related to properties of the moving object represented by parametric values. To make sure that erroneous samples are not introduced into the dataset, the sequence has to be reviewed frame by frame; when the ROI falls outside the tissue, it must be moved manually on the wall. Sometimes this procedure can be performed automatically with methods that depend from the software available. In most cases, these methods are based on standard edge detection algorithms or on cross-correlation alignment methods (Pratt, 1991); however, these techniques do not guarantee the accuracy of the results which must still be verified manually because they incorporate no information about the structure and the geometry of the object that is recognized. In another method, the brightness of an echographic image is evaluated along pixels that are aligned on an ideal segment crossing the moving object; for example, crossing the myocardium and having an origin and an end outside the myocardium. This is done for several successive images so that the variation with time of the brightness of each pixel along the ideal segment can be simultaneously represented for all times in a two-dimensional representation where one axis is the distance along the segment and the other axis is the time. Particularly relating to the example pertaining to the perfusion, a certain number of frames are extracted as representing a certain number of digital images from a echo-contrast recording during myocardial perfusion. In order to obtain valuable and comparable numeric data, an appropriate parametric curve is fitted to the measured data to obtain corresponding perfusion parameters. An object of the present invention is to provide an enhanced method for imaging the parameters of a tissue relating to a certain tissue property using the method according to the prior art as disclosed above and allowing at the same time to build an image in which the parameter value of each pixel or group of pixels is represented by a certain kind of appearance of the pixel or of the group of pixels and in which each pixel or group of pixels is represented in a pixel array in the correct or approximately correct spatial relation to the other pixels or groups of pixels as their spatial relation exists in the real object. The present invention achieves the above-mentioned aims by means of a method for generating time independent images of moving objects with the image information being related to properties of the moving object represented by providing a sequence of two- or three-dimensional digital images of an object in motion. The image information of the image sequence is transformed into a series of space-time representations of the image data, such as the value of a variable affecting the pixel appearance for each pixel or group of pixels positioned on a series of adjacent line-segments, so called “transmural cuts”, which line-segments are positioned in such a way as to cross the moving object or the moving part of the object and are distributed in such a way as to cover the entire moving object or the entire moving part of the object. Each space-time image of each transmural cut related to different images of the sequence is aligned in order to compensate for the motion of the object along the transmural cuts by translating and/or scaling each image along the same transmural cut at certain times relative to the other images taken at other times of the image sequence, in order to shift the images of the sequence along the same transmural cut which are taken at different times essentially for a distance corresponding to the displacement of the moving object or of the moving part of the object at the transmural cut and at a corresponding time. An evaluation function is defined, having at least one parameter, and calculating for each pixel or group of pixels the value of the parameter for best fit of the evaluation function with the curve representing the values of the pixel or group of pixels as a function of time obtained from the aligned space time images. A parametric image is constructed by defining a pixel appearance scale univocally or uniquely correlated to the parameter value obtained by the best fitting of the evaluation function and by giving to each pixel or group of pixels along each transmural cut a pixel appearance related to the corresponding calculated value of the parameter. In particular, the present invention provides for a method of acquiring a sequence of a certain number of digital images of a region of interest of an object which has at least one part performing a cyclic or oscillatory or non-oscillatory motion. A certain number of pixels or groups of pixels is defined along that segment line and an image is generated for each of the pixels along the segment-line and each of the images are printed or visualized together side by side in the correct time sequence, thus forming a two dimensional image defined by two axes where one axis is the distance along the line-segment, i.e. The motion of the part of the object is compensated by aligning relative to time the single adjacent images of the pixels or group of pixels along the line-segment being taken at different times by shifting and/or stretching relative to the distance axis the position of the pixels or group of pixels along the line for each image along the line-segment taken at different times. The pixel data, such as brightness or the like, obtained from the digital image of each pixel or group of pixels along the line-segment is retrieved and represents the pixel data in a two-dimensional image defined by two axes where one axis is the pixel data, such as brightness, and the other axis is time. The parameters of the estimation function leading to the best fit of the estimation function with the time dependent data obtained from the images are calculated. The preceding steps are repeated for each pixel or group of pixels along each of the further line segments. A scale of pixel appearance is defined which is univocally or uniquely related to the values of at least one parameter and which defines different appearances of the pixels or group of pixels. An image is reconstructed in which each pixel is positioned on its segment-line in its corresponding position, and the segment-lines are correctly positioned one with respect to the other and in which each pixel has a pixel appearance corresponding to the value calculated for at least one parameter of the pixel or group of pixels. According to the method of the invention, it is possible to evaluate the appropriate parameter or parameters for each pixel of the sequence of digital images such as, for example, an echographic loop, and it is possible to build new images with the graphic representation of such parameters. This kind of imaging is defined in the present specification as parametric imaging and is the synthesis of a sequence of digital images such as, but not limited to, an echographic loop, into a few parametric images where a parametric image is a representation of a parametric quantity, or a mathematical parameter, extracted from the analysis pixel by pixel, or of group of pixels, of the evolution of a moving tissue property. Parametric imaging can be extended to moving objects, such as tissues or any other kind of objects, of which digital images have been taken with any kind of imaging method. The digital images may be acquired as echographic images or as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images. A first difficulty comes from the fact that each pixel does not correspond (often not even approximately) to the same tissue region during the physiological motion and is overcome by the method according to the present invention which, with the pixel alignment step, also allows separation of the time component by giving an image of the moving object or of a part of the moving object frozen relative to time. The method according to the present invention allows continuous tracking in time not only of parts of an object which perform motions inside a two-dimensional digital image, but also inside three-dimensional representations (images or volume data sets). After the wall is recognized, it is straightforward to analyze the time evolution of properties in correspondence to the detected wall. The pixel values considered can be the brightness of a black and white image or one or more of the variables of a color image. The alignment of the images along a segment-line at different times to freeze the motion of an imaged moving object can be carried out according to several methods known from the art. Another way is to use contour recognition algorithms. As an estimation function to be fitted with the data obtained from the images, i.e. the pixel value or values such as brightness, hue, saturation, or color, it is suggested from literature of tissue perfusion to use an exponential function of the form y(t)=A(1−e−Bt), where y(t) is the pixel value depending on time, t is the time at which the pixel value was obtained in the image, and A and B are two parameters. The parameters can be imaged into different images built according to the parametric imaging method of the present invention, with both able to be imaged into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image. The value scale for imaging the different values of the parameters A and or B can be a color scale, which relates different colors to different pixel values or which relates different brightness or saturation values to a unique color for different pixel values. Reconstructing the image according to the above-disclosed method would lead to an image comprising pixels only along each of the different line-segments distributed over the image area of the object and being at a certain distance one from the other. According to a further embodiment, interpolation algorithms can be used to define pixel values for the pixel of the image lying between two adjacent line-segments by considering the pixel values along each of the two adjacent line-segments. So instead of reconstructing a partial image, the entire pixel array or image area can be used for imaging the parameters. Considering that the parametric image has to be used in order to carry out comparisons with the parametric images of other objects, parametric imaging allows the carrying out of a simple visual analysis by comparing images and also the quantitative comparison of numerical data in a pixel, a group of pixels, or a specific region of interest. 1 is an example of an echographic image of the myocardium. 3 is a schematic drawing representing the image according to FIG. 4 illustrates an image representing the space-time dependence of the image along one transmural cut. 5 illustrates the image according to FIG. 6 and 7 are schematic diagrams representing the images of FIGS. 4 and 5, in which four selected pixels Pi,1 to Pi,4 along the transmural cut are illustrated at four different times. 8 illustrates a diagram representing the relation between the brightness of one group of pixels in the images of FIGS. 9 illustrates an image generated according to the present invention, in which the value of each pixel along each of the transmural cuts represents the value of one of the parameters of the best fit curve by means of a univocal pixel appearance scale. 10 is a three-dimensional image generated according to the present invention analogous to the image of FIG. 11 is a schematic representation of the image according to FIG. 9, an appearance corresponding to the calculated parametric values correlated to the parametric value of the pixels. For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated herein and specific language will be used to describe the same. Any alterations and further modifications in the described processes, systems or devices, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. 1 illustrates a digital image 10 obtained by echographic imaging of a heart 12. As a first step of the method according to the present invention, a certain number of images or frames are taken at different successive times in order to have a time dependent image sequence. There is no limit to the number of images in the sequence due to the fact that the method leads to results with a small error and that the method does not take much calculation or imaging time to be carried out. This applies also for the number of transmural cuts 20 which are distributed over the area of the region of interest as illustrated in FIG. In order to have a more precise idea of the steps of the method according to the invention, the image of FIG. 2 has been represented in a schematic way with a drawing which is illustrated in FIG. For each of the transmural cuts 20, a sequence of images will be acquired and registered. Along each transmural cut 20, a certain number of pixels are selected. Also, this selection is taken according to the needs of the precision of the image. It depends merely on the resolution which is wanted in the final image. In the example of the schematic drawings of FIGS. 3, 6, 7 and 11, the pixels have been chosen far away from each other in order to better appreciate the way of working of the method. This situation does normally not correspond to the real situation where the pixels are more closely spaced one to the other. Furthermore, it has to be noted that depending on the property which is examined, it might be useful to consider groups of pixels instead of single pixels, so the definition “pixel” is always to be intended as comprising also the term “group of pixels”. In the example of FIG. 3, a specific transmural cut TCi is illustrated along which the pixels Pi,1 to Pi,4 have been illustratively shown in order to better explain the method according to the present invention. It is to be further noted that although the figures are directed to an example considering echographic images of a biological object such as a heart, the method according to the present invention can be applied to any kind of digital image of any kind of moving object which has properties capable of being described by parameters. Thus each pixel has a different brightness with different concentrations of the contrast agent in the tissue of the myocardium, i.e. 4 represents an image where the image data taken along a certain transmural cut, in this case transmural cuts TCi, is taken at different times and is positioned one beside the other in the correct time sequence. The vertical axis 26 represents the position d of the pixels along the transmural cut as taken from the origin of the transmural cut, while the horizontal axis 28 represents time t.\nFIG. 6 is a drawing simplifying the image of FIG. The position of the pixels is illustrated with reference to four different times T1 to T4, which are chosen spaced one from the other for better understanding purposes. As it is shown in FIG. The sequence of images along the transmural cut has a double time dependence. One dependence is related to the changing of the perfusion of contrast agent in the myocardium, which affects the brightness of the pixels, and the other dependence is due to the motion of the myocardium. In order to eliminate the second time dependence, the method according to the present invention carries out an alignment step with respect to the time of the single pixel images. In this case, the step will produce a vertical shift of the pixel images at the different times which will align each of the four different pixels related to an image at a certain time with the corresponding pixel on each other image occurring at different times. Another solution calculates the vertical shift parameter for each pixel at different times by using a barycentre function of the undulated image of FIGS. The result of this operation is illustrated in the image of FIG. 5, which is a real image of an example, and in the drawing of FIG. 7, which relates to the simplified schematic diagram of FIG. The time-dependent space image obtained for each transmural cut is shown as a frozen image of the myocardium with respect to its motion, but which still contains the time dependence of the brightness values of the pixels. In this case, the time dependence of the brightness of the pixels on the transmural cut TCi have been plotted or represented. According to a further step, for each pixel Pi,k of each transmural cut TC1, the said above-mentioned steps are carried out, and furthermore for each pixel Pi,k of each transmural cut TC1, the parameters of an estimation function giving the best fit of the estimation function with the time dependence curve of the pixel brightness is calculated. 8 is also illustrated as line 36 in FIG. By carrying out this parameter computation step for each pixel of each transmural cut, there are obtained a certain number of pixels Pi,k having a defined position relative to one another and having a univocally or uniquely related pair of best fit parameters Ai,k and Bi,k. The position is precisely defined by the position of the transmural cut TCi in the pixel array of the image and by the position of the pixels Pi,k on the transmural cut TCi. The computed value of the parameters Ai,k and Bi,k for each pixel Pi,k can be brought into a univocal or unique relationship with a pixel value corresponding to a scale of different pixel appearances. For example, this scale might consider a certain frequency range with definite frequency steps based on the color of the pixels, which vary with the variation of the value of the parameters. Another way of rendering visible the parameter value is to chose for each parameter a certain color and defining a step-like or continuous brightness scale of that color which is related uniquely to the parameter value. Any kind of combination of the variables commonly used for defining the pixel appearance in a digital image formed by an array of pixels may be used in order to create a pixel appearance scale uniquely related to the parameter values. As a last step of the method of the present invention, an image is reconstructed by printing or visualizing each pixel Pi,k along each transmural cut TCi in the corresponding position of a pixel array, that is in the position as defined by the position of the transmural cut TCi and by the position of the pixel Pi,k along the corresponding transmural cut, and by giving to each pixel Pi,k an appearance relating to its values, for example color, brightness, or any kind of appearance defined by any kind of combination of variables defining pixel appearance which are uniquely related to the value of the parameter Ai,k and/or Bi,k of the related pixel Pi,k. 9 and for the parameter Bi,k in the three-dimensional image of a myocardium 42 shown in FIG. 11 is a drawing which shows the construction of the image illustrated in FIG. 9, 10, and 11 that giving to the pixels Pi,1, Pi,2, Pi,3, and Pi,4 a position as defined by the corresponding transmural cut TCi and by the position of the pixel on the transmural cut TCi, an image of the myocardium can be constructed in which each pixel has an appearance which is univocally or uniquely related to the value of the parameter Ai,k and/or Bi,k calculated for each pixel. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the term “echographic image” does not refer exclusively to an echographic image but also to an image frame. The sequence of echographic images can also be interpreted as a sequence of image frames. This is important since often echographic images are obtained by acquisition of a certain number of frames which are then combined to form a single image. In the case of a moving object which is to be imaged, it is preferable to use as a sequence of images a sequence of image frames. 10 shows the same result as FIGS. In fact, the method of the present invention associates numerical, quantitative parameter values to each pixel that are commonly best visualized in color-scale images, but which can also be represented in different ways. The present invention contemplates modifications as would occur to those skilled in the art. It is also contemplated that processes embodied in the present invention can be altered, rearranged, substituted, deleted, duplicated, combined, or added to other processes as would occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention.

The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) quantization, which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input (lossy compression). The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application. Tissue types could be discriminated by utilizing a combination of fuzzy k-means cluster analysis and a supervised classification algorithm based on a linear discriminant analysis. The spectral classification is compared and contrasted with the histological stained image. The 15-fold Cassegrainian objective with a numerical aperture of 0.4 imaged a sample area of ∼270×270 μm2. The pixel binning reduces the spatial resolution to ∼ 170 μm. A reference spectroscopic image was recorded from the pure calcium ﬂuoride window. Spectra at a resolution of 8 cm−1 of the sample image were rationed against the spectra of the reference image and transferred to absorbance values. The frame rate of the focal plane detector was 3773 Hz, yielding a total measurement time of approximately 20 s for each individual spectroscopic image. The main part of the data analysis is based on in-house written programs, in particular for data preprocessing and image processing. The flow chart of the data processing is sketched in Fig. Data preprocessing involves a removal of outliers, a linear two-point baseline correction, and a normalization of each absorbance value of a spectrum to the integral absorbance. Both tissues were used to train the classification algorithm to find the discriminatory spectral patterns in the data set. As it can be expected, the color coded bright field infrared image of the marked area [see Fig. 2d, which shows the fingerprint region (950 to 1750 cm−1) used for the data analysis. For every pixel the integral intensity across the spectral range 950 to 1750 cm−1 is transformed to a rainbow-scale. Red and yellow pixels in the upper right corner indicate an artifact of the thin section. Figure 3 depicts the top four principal components that cover more than 98% of the total variance of the spectroscopic image. Significant features of the PCs are displayed in the loading plots. First four principal components of the spectroscopic data set. In spectroscopic data sets, however, overlapping of clusters as well as noise and outliers are common. (a) Assignment of clusters, (b) Cluster centroid spectra. 2) is mainly represented by red, orange, and yellow pixels. However, there are also a considerable number of yellow to red pixels in this region. One approach to improve the classification accuracy is the application of the supervised methods.23 Supervised classification allows to categorize the questionable pixels into different themes, based on the spectral characteristics of tumor and normal tissue. Since violet and blue clusters in Fig. Figure 6a shows the classification result. The probability of the class assignment is transferred into a blue-dark gray-yellow color scale. Spectra that could not be assigned to one of the classes are represented as blue-gray or yellow-gray pixels. Gray pixels indicate spectra used for the training set. Pixels that have a probability of more than 60% as a tumor are colored in yellow and merged with the H&E stained image. The image fusion in Fig. Gray pixels were selected to form the training set and are not classified. The highlighted regions are those identified by the classification algorithm as informative in classifying the spectra into the two classes. We thank the Bruker Optik GmbH (Ettlingen and Leipzig, Germany) for their technical support. The RGB values of typical digital images do not directly correspond to the physical light intensities, but are rather compressed by a gamma correction function:  Note that only the color components undergo gamma-correction; the alpha channel is always linear.\n\n"

Under the definition of heading, the attributes of an element do not appear in any particular order either, nor, therefore do the elements of a tuple. is that it describes sequences of at least three elements, the first three being of types ,  ,   respectively. As a result,  conforms to (may be assigned to) , to   and to   (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform. 1) The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set Using Kuratowski's representation for an ordered pair, the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure set theory:\n\n In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements. An n-tuple is a sequence (or ordered list) of n elements, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\n"
