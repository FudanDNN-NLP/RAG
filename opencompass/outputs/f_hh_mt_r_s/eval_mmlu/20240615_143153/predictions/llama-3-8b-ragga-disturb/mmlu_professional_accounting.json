The average total cost per patient was $7,992.55. Although the amount transferred increased with increasing costs, it was not proportional to the total cost, resulting in a percentage difference in revenue that was increasingly negative for each increase in cost and hospital stay. The Brazilian health system is undergoing an important financial crisis that threatens the survival of hospital organizations, especially philanthropic ones, that play an essential role in serving the poorest class of the population. These philanthropic institutions benefit from tax immunity, but must allocate 60% of their capacity to the Unified Public Health System (SUS) or 20% of their total services as free services to the population[1-3]. In this way, they face serious financial problems that may compromise their survival and impact on meeting the population's demand, considering the various health care procedures that are performed by SUS throughout Brazil. Among the several cardiac surgeries performed by SUS in Brazil, the most frequent is coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), performed in both public and private hospitals throughout the country. However, few Brazilian studies have analyzed the cost of this complex procedure and the specific transfer of funds from SUS regarding this surgery. The main characteristics of this costing system are the need for apportionment in the case of appropriation of indirect costs, and that the results are directly influenced by the production volume. On the other hand, the transfer of funds from SUS consists of the amount of money paid by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to health institutions for their performed procedures, pursuant to Administrative Rule no. 204 of January 29, 2007, which regulates the financing and transfer of federal resources to health actions and services, with appropriate monitoring and control. SUS spent more than R$209 million to perform isolated CABGs and/or those associated with other procedures in the city of São Paulo from 2011 to 2014, which corresponded to an average expenditure of R$12,025.66 per patient. These expenses are derived from amounts transferred from SUS measuring or from contracts that some hospitals establish with the system, and not by measuring the costs of surgeries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the coverage percentage of hospitalization costs for CABG by fund transfer from SUS in a philanthropic hospital in the city of São Paulo that implements the consolidated Absorption Costing System. A quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study carried out in the Beneficência Portuguesa Hospital of São Paulo, which is a philanthropic, special-purpose hospital in the city of São Paulo. The information for this study was extracted from a database composed of 1913 patients submitted to CABG at the surveyed institution, aged 18 years or older in the period from March 13 to September 30, 2012, and includes data from 100% of all CABG performed at the hospital in this period. Isolated surgeries (without other associated procedures), elective surgeries (which were not urgent or an emergency), surgeries using extracorporeal circulation (EC) and those that had SUS funding as a source for hospitalization costs were included in the study. However, the sum of exclusion was not 551, since some patients were excluded due to more than one reason for not participating in the study, according to the exclusion criteria [172 (9%) non-SUS; 13 (0.7%) for not having cost information; 76 (4.0%) deaths, 206 (10.8%) non-isolated CABG; 17 (0.9%) urgencies; 1 (0.05%) emergency; 132 (6.9%) without EC and 8 (0.4%) patients who remained in the ICU at the time of the database closing on the 30th postoperative day]. We analyzed the cost variables available in the database such as the total cost of hospital admissions, revenue transfers by SUS and the difference between revenue and cost. The Brazilian real (R$) was converted to US dollar ($). We used the quotation value of the dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012, which was 2.0265 reais. We considered the dollar value close to the finishing date of data collection (09/30/2012), since there was no access to the cost per patient at the time of hospital discharge. The Absorption Costing System was implemented in 2010 into the hospital under study from the perspective of managerial accounting with the formation of cost centers. Thus, it was possible to gauge total costs by summing the direct, indirect, fixed and variable costs of the services, procedures and examinations, transposing the values into daily hospital charges and fees. The fund transfer process from SUS is done according to inpatient hospital authorizations (IHA) generated for the patient. The Beneficência Portuguesa Hospital uses a consolidated controlling service from SUS, which sends the debits from specific sites to MOH, which are analyzed, and the corresponding values are then transferred to the hospital. Minimum and maximum values were analyzed for variable cost, revenue and time intervals, and averages, standard deviations and medians were then calculated. The first part presents a panoramic view of data on costs, revenues and funds transferred from SUS for CABG hospitalization (Table 1). Cost data are presented in American dollars. Table 1 Comparison of the descriptive values of cost, revenue and percentage of funds transferred from SUS in American dollars ($), for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery from March to September 2012 - São Paulo, Brazil, 2017. (2)Transfer coverage calculated by the direct average calculation, based on the value of the difference in revenue deficit.The quotation of the US dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012 was 2.0265 reais (http://economia.uol.com.br/cotacoes/cambio/dolar-comercial-estados unidos/?historico). Table 2 Cost and revenue descriptive values in American dollars ($), for patients submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery from March to September 2012 - São Paulo, Brazil, 2017 (n=1362). Table 3 Comparison of the descriptive values of cost and revenue in American dollars ($), for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery from March to September 2012, according to the length of stay - São Paulo, Brazil, 2017. Percentage individually calculated through statistical analysis and with the value rounded for each patient in the sample (descriptive level of probability of the non-parametric Mann Whitney test).The quotation of the US dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012 was 2.0265 reais (http://economia.uol.com.br/cotacoes/cambio/dolar-comercial-estados-unidos/?historico). According to Table 1, the consolidated total cost on hospital admission for the sample of 1362 patients was $10,885,855.91, and consolidated revenue was $4,699,897.85, with the total funds transferred from SUS being 43.17% of the costs, and total negative revenue of 56.83%. The total average cost of hospitalization per patient as described in Table 1 was $7,992.55, and according to information provided by the Hospital Cost Management under study, the direct cost of hospitalization for CABGs in 2012 was 58% of the total cost, $4,635.68, and the indirect cost was 42%, $3,356.87. According to Table 1, the average revenue transferred by SUS was $3,450.73, presenting an average coverage percentage of 48.66% of the total cost, thus generating average negative revenue of 51.34% to the hospital, of which the largest portion is destined to the payment of medical fees. A difference was found in relation to the average revenue deficit and the average of SUS transfers shown in Table 1, since the average revenue deficit and all calculations of cost, revenue and the percentage difference between cost and revenue were statistically and individually calculated for each of the 1362 patients in the sample. This calculation of the transfer percentage was based on the percentage difference of the revenue deficit. According to Table 2, the total cost ranged from $3,300.26 to $152,132.10. Of these, 22 (1.62%) cases had a total cost between $49,346.16 and $98,692.33, four (0.29%) cases between $98,692.33 and $148,038.49 and one (0.07%) case above $148,038.49. Comparing the total cost and the funds transferred from SUS among readmitted and non-readmitted patients (1206), it was verified that although those readmitted had higher costs and higher revenues, the difference between cost and revenue was higher, thus generating a higher percentage of negative revenue in relation to the group without readmission (58.49% vs. 50.41%, P<0.001). At the institution under study, the medical practice manual defines that LOS in isolated and elective CABGs should be up to seven days. Thus, for a better cost evaluation and fund transfer from SUS, patients were divided into Group 1 (LOS≤7 days) and Group 2 (LOS>7 days), and in comparing the groups, it was possible to verify that 69.5% of the sample presented LOS>7 days. Data from the present research showed that the total funds transferred from SUS only covered 43.17% of the total consolidated cost and generated a revenue deficit of 56.83%. Although CABG is the most performed heart surgery by SUS in Brazil, few studies have analyzed the costs of the procedure. In the few Brazilian studies on CABG costs, it can be noticed that some did not assess procedure nor hospitalization costs. Some authors have considered the values of fixed tables as costs based on Inpatient Hospital Authorization (IHA) or on prices of pre-established packages[4,12]. Others cited the transferred funds from SUS as a direct cost and additional institutional costs as indirect costs, which may underestimate the real cost of the procedure. A study carried out in a public hospital in the city of São Paulo revealed that coverage from SUS for the total average cost of the procedure in primary, isolated and elective CABGs in 2005 was 79.41% of the direct costs of the procedure. According to the Health Information Portal of the Municipality of São Paulo/IHA, the consolidated funds transferred from SUS through the total amount of IHA paid for CABG (isolated and associated with other procedures) from 2011 to 2014 was R$209,883,898.93; of which R$57,094,462.41 in 2011, R$55,322,437.14 in 2012, R$48,746,376.00 in 2013 and R$48,720,623.38 in 2014. However, the average transferred per patient from 2011 to 2014 was R$12,025.66, with R$11,862.55 in 2011, R$12,052.82 in 2012, R$12,045.06 in 2013 and R$12,171.03 in 2014. Comparing the consolidated funds transferred from SUS for CABGs of the present research to the municipality of São Paulo in 2012, it was verified that the value transferred to the institution under study corresponded to 17.22% of the funds transferred to the municipality. It is worth mentioning that the research institution was responsible for 16.4 to 17.5% of the CABGs performed by SUS in the period from 2008 to 2014[15,16], a significant percentage of this procedure in the country. When comparing the mean of funds transferred from SUS for CABG per patient in 2012 between data from this research and data from the city of São Paulo, it was verified that the funds transferred in the present research corresponded to 58.02% of the average per patient in the municipality. However, the study sample was from isolated and elective CABGs. Most Brazilian studies only address the direct cost of the procedure, with almost no studies addressing the total cost or transferred funds from SUS for CABGs. In 2015, a study was published on average total cost and transfers from SUS for cardiac surgeries performed in 2013, with 48.8% of the evaluated surgeries being CABGs. This study showed that transfers increased according to the severity of the EuroSCORE, while the funds transferred for low-risk patients was R$14,306.00, for medium-risk R$16,217.00, and R$19,548.00 for high-risk patients (P<0.001), corresponding to coverages of 52.75%, 46.53% and 45.21%, respectively. The average LOS in this study was 11.23 days, which was below the average of São Paulo in 2012 (13.29 days). Another study on isolated CABGs and those associated with other procedures in 2010 in the same institution under study found a mean LOS of 11 days, with prolonged stay in 62.67% of the patients. In these two years (2010 and 2012), there was no significant difference in the mean of LOS, but the percentage of prolonged stay increased by 6.83%, thus making a more detailed study of this population very interesting. Comparing the total average cost of hospitalization between groups according to the LOS, there was a significant increase in the cost for Group 2 (group with LOS>7 days), (P<0.001), and although the transferred funds were greater for this group, it was noticed that Group 1 (group with LOS less than or equal to 7 days) had a higher coverage percentage of the total average cost (Group 1 had 58.09% vs. Group 2 with 44.52%). Therefore, this demonstrates that the higher the LOS, the higher the cost and the funds transferred from SUS (P<0.001). However, the funds transferred were not proportional to the cost, thereby resulting in an increasingly negative percentage difference of revenue for each increase in cost and hospital stay. CABG costs have increased over time due to technological advances. However, even though the funds transferred from SUS have increased, they remain insufficient and cover just about half of hospital costs. This mismatch between cost and funds being transferred can cause financial losses to healthcare institutions, which are contracted with SUS throughout the country, compromising their market survival and their ability to meet the population's demand. The data of this study corroborate the affirmation of some authors that, in relation to the destination of government funds for public health expenditures, the transfer of funds from SUS is out of date and insufficient to cover the costs of performed surgical procedures, and this scenario may worsen with the increase in the number of cardiovascular surgeries[4,17]. In view of this, the question arises as to the need to seek strategies for managing and reducing costs, such as reducing LOS, increasing bed rotation and increasing attending demand, in line with SUS principles of accessibility for patients. It is necessary to review health policies in government offices for contracting the value of the funds transferred from SUS, ensuring the financial integrity of hospital institutions. New Brazilian studies on the coverage of funds transferred from SUS for the total hospitalization costs in elective isolated CABGs will be necessary for a real comparability with the data of this research, and may contribute to having more parameters on health costs in Brazil. Since this is a study with a database, only three cost variables (total cost, funds transferred by SUS and the difference between revenue and cost) were found. Funds transferred from SUS covered less than half the total average hospitalization costs of CABGs (48.66%). Although the funds transferred from SUS increased according to costs, these transfers were not proportional to the total cost, resulting in a percentage difference of increasingly negative revenue with each increase in cost and hospital stay. to communities along the travel corridors but also would be a strong business investment.” The study projected development costs of about $40 billion, but would see a $30 billion profit in the first 25 years of operation. The study also predicted a 931,745 increase in jobs, $74.8 billion increase in property values, and an expanded tax base that would generate $12.7 billion in government revenue from 2025 to 2050. The report also projected that the renewable powered emission-free hyperloop system proposed by HyperloopTT would eliminate 143 million tons of Carbon Dioxide emissions by replacing air, car, and rail transit along the corridor.

Investment *All deposits made at start of the period Returns\n\nLong gone are the days when a new medical product could be easily introduced based solely on improved patient outcomes. Will the financial re­striction lead to less innovation in technology as companies have lower profit margins to fund internal R&D? Most commercial insurance plans and HMOs will not share their data for a variety of business reasons. We will use these numbers later to make estimates on the amount of commercial R&D money being invested. Figure 1 shows the total number of allowed services for years 2000-2009 (2010 is not yet available). Figure 2 shows the total dollar amount of the charges by year. Figure 3 shows estimated cost per service obtained by dividing the total dollar charges by the number of services. Some striking features of these figures include the high rate of growth, from less than half a million series in 2000 toward over eight million services in 2010. This represents a ~36% annual growth rate over the past nine years (2000-2009) — although that growth was faster over the first half of the decade than the second half of the decade (about 18% in 2009) . The annual dollar charge approaches $400 million in 2010. This level of reimbursement can easily support the estimated $250 million of worldwide OCT capital equipment sales mentioned above. The increase in aggregate charges for CPT 92135 oc­curred despite downward adjustment in the per-procedure charge. Further, the average payment for CPT code 92135 has been reduced from $52.25 in 2010 to $48.33 in 2011, and this is the amount for scanning one eye or two! Assuming that the average OCT system costs ~$60,000, this implies a payback of about three years, not accounting for the other costs, such as labor. OCT is becoming a cost for any practice to do business. Pressure on reducing reimbursements’ dollars per procedure or increasing the requirement hurdle for the procedure not only will affect revenue for practitioners but also revenue for the OCT capital equipment manufacturers. Further reductions in revenue for capital equipment suppliers may limit the amount of innovation coming to market. Assuming 40% margins on OCT equipment and given that a typical company may plow ~30% back into R&D implies a total R&D budget for commercial companies of about $30 million per year. For the near term, this level of R&D expenditure ($30 million to $60 million a year) still represents a healthy number for innovation, especially because so many OCT companies are now competing to differentiate their products and are probably gambling that more R&D dollars will garner additional market share. This is complicated by the natural tendency to compress margins to win market share. Over the past 10 years, US OCT has grown at an impressive average of 36% YOY. Over the next decade, this trend of cost containment will likely become an increasingly formidable problem for practitioners, capital equipment suppliers, and startups that want to become suppliers. Investment costs for multipurpose plants are high in comparison with product output. However, they vary considerably, depending on the location, size of equipment and degree of sophistication (e.g., automation, containment, quality of equipment, complexity of infrastructure). The investment cost of $21 million comprises just the equipment and installation. The building, property and external services are excluded.

The average total cost per patient was $7,992.55.

We analyzed the cost variables available in the database such as the total cost of hospital admissions, revenue transfers by SUS and the difference between revenue and cost. The Brazilian real (R$) was converted to US dollar ($). We used the quotation value of the dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012, which was 2.0265 reais. We considered the dollar value close to the finishing date of data collection (09/30/2012), since there was no access to the cost per patient at the time of hospital discharge.

The first part presents a panoramic view of data on costs, revenues and funds transferred from SUS for CABG hospitalization (Table 1). Cost data are presented in American dollars.

Percentage individually calculated through statistical analysis and with the value rounded for each patient in the sample (descriptive level of probability of the non-parametric Mann Whitney test).The quotation of the US dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012 was 2.0265 reais (http://economia.uol.com.br/cotacoes/cambio/dolar-comercial-estados-unidos/?historico). According to Table 1, the consolidated total cost on hospital admission for the sample of 1362 patients was $10,885,855.91, and consolidated revenue was $4,699,897.85, with the total funds transferred from SUS being 43.17% of the costs, and total negative revenue of 56.83%. The total average cost of hospitalization per patient as described in Table 1 was $7,992.55, and according to information provided by the Hospital Cost Management under study, the direct cost of hospitalization for CABGs in 2012 was 58% of the total cost, $4,635.68, and the indirect cost was 42%, $3,356.87. According to Table 1, the average revenue transferred by SUS was $3,450.73, presenting an average coverage percentage of 48.66% of the total cost, thus generating average negative revenue of 51.34% to the hospital, of which the largest portion is destined to the payment of medical fees. A difference was found in relation to the average revenue deficit and the average of SUS transfers shown in Table 1, since the average revenue deficit and all calculations of cost, revenue and the percentage difference between cost and revenue were statistically and individually calculated for each of the 1362 patients in the sample. This calculation of the transfer percentage was based on the percentage difference of the revenue deficit. According to Table 2, the total cost ranged from $3,300.26 to $152,132.10. Of these, 22 (1.62%) cases had a total cost between $49,346.16 and $98,692.33, four (0.29%) cases between $98,692.33 and $148,038.49 and one (0.07%) case above $148,038.49. Comparing the total cost and the funds transferred from SUS among readmitted and non-readmitted patients (1206), it was verified that although those readmitted had higher costs and higher revenues, the difference between cost and revenue was higher, thus generating a higher percentage of negative revenue in relation to the group without readmission (58.49% vs. 50.41%, P<0.001). At the institution under study, the medical practice manual defines that LOS in isolated and elective CABGs should be up to seven days. Thus, for a better cost evaluation and fund transfer from SUS, patients were divided into Group 1 (LOS≤7 days) and Group 2 (LOS>7 days), and in comparing the groups, it was possible to verify that 69.5% of the sample presented LOS>7 days. Data from the present research showed that the total funds transferred from SUS only covered 43.17% of the total consolidated cost and generated a revenue deficit of 56.83%. Although CABG is the most performed heart surgery by SUS in Brazil, few studies have analyzed the costs of the procedure. In the few Brazilian studies on CABG costs, it can be noticed that some did not assess procedure nor hospitalization costs. Some authors have considered the values of fixed tables as costs based on Inpatient Hospital Authorization (IHA) or on prices of pre-established packages[4,12]. Others cited the transferred funds from SUS as a direct cost and additional institutional costs as indirect costs, which may underestimate the real cost of the procedure. A study carried out in a public hospital in the city of São Paulo revealed that coverage from SUS for the total average cost of the procedure in primary, isolated and elective CABGs in 2005 was 79.41% of the direct costs of the procedure. According to the Health Information Portal of the Municipality of São Paulo/IHA, the consolidated funds transferred from SUS through the total amount of IHA paid for CABG (isolated and associated with other procedures) from 2011 to 2014 was R$209,883,898.93; of which R$57,094,462.41 in 2011, R$55,322,437.14 in 2012, R$48,746,376.00 in 2013 and R$48,720,623.38 in 2014. However, the average transferred per patient from 2011 to 2014 was R$12,025.66, with R$11,862.55 in 2011, R$12,052.82 in 2012, R$12,045.06 in 2013 and R$12,171.03 in 2014. Comparing the consolidated funds transferred from SUS for CABGs of the present research to the municipality of São Paulo in 2012, it was verified that the value transferred to the institution under study corresponded to 17.22% of the funds transferred to the municipality. It is worth mentioning that the research institution was responsible for 16.4 to 17.5% of the CABGs performed by SUS in the period from 2008 to 2014[15,16], a significant percentage of this procedure in the country. When comparing the mean of funds transferred from SUS for CABG per patient in 2012 between data from this research and data from the city of São Paulo, it was verified that the funds transferred in the present research corresponded to 58.02% of the average per patient in the municipality. However, the study sample was from isolated and elective CABGs. Most Brazilian studies only address the direct cost of the procedure, with almost no studies addressing the total cost or transferred funds from SUS for CABGs. In 2015, a study was published on average total cost and transfers from SUS for cardiac surgeries performed in 2013, with 48.8% of the evaluated surgeries being CABGs. This study showed that transfers increased according to the severity of the EuroSCORE, while the funds transferred for low-risk patients was R$14,306.00, for medium-risk R$16,217.00, and R$19,548.00 for high-risk patients (P<0.001), corresponding to coverages of 52.75%, 46.53% and 45.21%, respectively. The average LOS in this study was 11.23 days, which was below the average of São Paulo in 2012 (13.29 days). Another study on isolated CABGs and those associated with other procedures in 2010 in the same institution under study found a mean LOS of 11 days, with prolonged stay in 62.67% of the patients. In these two years (2010 and 2012), there was no significant difference in the mean of LOS, but the percentage of prolonged stay increased by 6.83%, thus making a more detailed study of this population very interesting. Comparing the total average cost of hospitalization between groups according to the LOS, there was a significant increase in the cost for Group 2 (group with LOS>7 days), (P<0.001), and although the transferred funds were greater for this group, it was noticed that Group 1 (group with LOS less than or equal to 7 days) had a higher coverage percentage of the total average cost (Group 1 had 58.09% vs. Group 2 with 44.52%). Therefore, this demonstrates that the higher the LOS, the higher the cost and the funds transferred from SUS (P<0.001). However, the funds transferred were not proportional to the cost, thereby resulting in an increasingly negative percentage difference of revenue for each increase in cost and hospital stay. CABG costs have increased over time due to technological advances. However, even though the funds transferred from SUS have increased, they remain insufficient and cover just about half of hospital costs. This mismatch between cost and funds being transferred can cause financial losses to healthcare institutions, which are contracted with SUS throughout the country, compromising their market survival and their ability to meet the population's demand. The data of this study corroborate the affirmation of some authors that, in relation to the destination of government funds for public health expenditures, the transfer of funds from SUS is out of date and insufficient to cover the costs of performed surgical procedures, and this scenario may worsen with the increase in the number of cardiovascular surgeries[4,17]. In view of this, the question arises as to the need to seek strategies for managing and reducing costs, such as reducing LOS, increasing bed rotation and increasing attending demand, in line with SUS principles of accessibility for patients. It is necessary to review health policies in government offices for contracting the value of the funds transferred from SUS, ensuring the financial integrity of hospital institutions. New Brazilian studies on the coverage of funds transferred from SUS for the total hospitalization costs in elective isolated CABGs will be necessary for a real comparability with the data of this research, and may contribute to having more parameters on health costs in Brazil. Since this is a study with a database, only three cost variables (total cost, funds transferred by SUS and the difference between revenue and cost) were found. Funds transferred from SUS covered less than half the total average hospitalization costs of CABGs (48.66%). Although the funds transferred from SUS increased according to costs, these transfers were not proportional to the total cost, resulting in a percentage difference of increasingly negative revenue with each increase in cost and hospital stay. to communities along the travel corridors but also would be a strong business investment.” The study projected development costs of about $40 billion, but would see a $30 billion profit in the first 25 years of operation. The study also predicted a 931,745 increase in jobs, $74.8 billion increase in property values, and an expanded tax base that would generate $12.7 billion in government revenue from 2025 to 2050. The report also projected that the renewable powered emission-free hyperloop system proposed by HyperloopTT would eliminate 143 million tons of Carbon Dioxide emissions by replacing air, car, and rail transit along the corridor.

Will the financial re­striction lead to less innovation in technology as companies have lower profit margins to fund internal R&D? Most commercial insurance plans and HMOs will not share their data for a variety of business reasons. We will use these numbers later to make estimates on the amount of commercial R&D money being invested. Figure 1 shows the total number of allowed services for years 2000-2009 (2010 is not yet available). Figure 2 shows the total dollar amount of the charges by year. Figure 3 shows estimated cost per service obtained by dividing the total dollar charges by the number of services. Some striking features of these figures include the high rate of growth, from less than half a million series in 2000 toward over eight million services in 2010. This represents a ~36% annual growth rate over the past nine years (2000-2009) — although that growth was faster over the first half of the decade than the second half of the decade (about 18% in 2009) . The annual dollar charge approaches $400 million in 2010. This level of reimbursement can easily support the estimated $250 million of worldwide OCT capital equipment sales mentioned above. The increase in aggregate charges for CPT 92135 oc­curred despite downward adjustment in the per-procedure charge. Further, the average payment for CPT code 92135 has been reduced from $52.25 in 2010 to $48.33 in 2011, and this is the amount for scanning one eye or two! Assuming that the average OCT system costs ~$60,000, this implies a payback of about three years, not accounting for the other costs, such as labor. OCT is becoming a cost for any practice to do business. Pressure on reducing reimbursements’ dollars per procedure or increasing the requirement hurdle for the procedure not only will affect revenue for practitioners but also revenue for the OCT capital equipment manufacturers. Further reductions in revenue for capital equipment suppliers may limit the amount of innovation coming to market. Assuming 40% margins on OCT equipment and given that a typical company may plow ~30% back into R&D implies a total R&D budget for commercial companies of about $30 million per year. For the near term, this level of R&D expenditure ($30 million to $60 million a year) still represents a healthy number for innovation, especially because so many OCT companies are now competing to differentiate their products and are probably gambling that more R&D dollars will garner additional market share. This is complicated by the natural tendency to compress margins to win market share. Over the past 10 years, US OCT has grown at an impressive average of 36% YOY. Over the next decade, this trend of cost containment will likely become an increasingly formidable problem for practitioners, capital equipment suppliers, and startups that want to become suppliers. Investment costs for multipurpose plants are high in comparison with product output. However, they vary considerably, depending on the location, size of equipment and degree of sophistication (e.g., automation, containment, quality of equipment, complexity of infrastructure). The investment cost of $21 million comprises just the equipment and installation. The building, property and external services are excluded. In this case, it is $0.9 million.\n\n"

For example, under IFRS, at a company's year end, if an unfinished good that already cost $25 is expected to sell for $100 to a customer, but it will take an additional $20 to complete and $10 to advertise to the customer, its NRV will be $100-$20-$10=$70.

Period costs, such as office salaries or selling expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues of the accounting \n\nAs of July 31, 2018, the registrant had 42,026,390 shares of common stock outstanding. The results of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2018 or any other future period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for discussion of our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. Inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We review all inventory balances on a quarterly basis for impairment and recognize any reduction in value as a current period expense with a reserve provision on the consolidated balance sheets. If the conditions that caused the impairment were to be resolved in a subsequent period, the reserve provision would not be reversed until the related inventory was sold or otherwise disposed. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“Topic 606” or “ASU 2014-09”) using the modified retrospective method which consisted of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application. The following paragraphs in this section describe our revenue recognition accounting polices under Topic 606 upon adoption on January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. We do not intend to sell the securities that are in an unrealized loss position and we believe it is more likely than not that the investments will be held until recovery of the amortized cost bases. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our securities as of June 30, 2018 were temporary in nature. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of May 16, 2017 (the “Indenture”), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2017. The Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have a deferred revenue balance related to the Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of the $25.0 million upfront payment. Unless earlier terminated, the Maruho G.T. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have a deferred revenue balance related to the Maruho G.T. We expressed our intent to terminate the UCB Agreement in accordance with its terms. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $1.0 million transaction price has been fully recognized as revenue as of June 30, 2018. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. As of June 30, 2018, no other revenue will be recognized from UCB in future periods pursuant to the Transition Agreement as all performance obligations have been satisfied and the entire transaction price has been recognized. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. The payments due in 2018 were measured on a non-recurring basis using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate used to value the payments at present value as of the effective date of the Roche Agreement. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. Except as may be required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, net loss decreased 38% to $23.9 million from $38.6 million for the same period in 2017. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following changes to our critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported condensed consolidated financial results, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method which consisted of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application. All periods prior to the adoption date of Topic 606 have not been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of Topic 606, but continue to be accounted for and presented under Topic 605.\n\n administrative costs for government revenue departments and reduce compliance costs for corporate taxpayers.

Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“Topic 606” or “ASU 2014-09”) using the modified retrospective method which consisted of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application. The following paragraphs in this section describe our revenue recognition accounting polices under Topic 606 upon adoption on January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. We do not intend to sell the securities that are in an unrealized loss position and we believe it is more likely than not that the investments will be held until recovery of the amortized cost bases. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our securities as of June 30, 2018 were temporary in nature. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of May 16, 2017 (the “Indenture”), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2017. The Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have a deferred revenue balance related to the Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of the $25.0 million upfront payment. Unless earlier terminated, the Maruho G.T. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have a deferred revenue balance related to the Maruho G.T. We expressed our intent to terminate the UCB Agreement in accordance with its terms. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $1.0 million transaction price has been fully recognized as revenue as of June 30, 2018. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. As of June 30, 2018, no other revenue will be recognized from UCB in future periods pursuant to the Transition Agreement as all performance obligations have been satisfied and the entire transaction price has been recognized. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. The payments due in 2018 were measured on a non-recurring basis using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate used to value the payments at present value as of the effective date of the Roche Agreement. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. Except as may be required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, net loss decreased 38% to $23.9 million from $38.6 million for the same period in 2017. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following changes to our critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported condensed consolidated financial results, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method which consisted of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application. All periods prior to the adoption date of Topic 606 have not been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of Topic 606, but continue to be accounted for and presented under Topic 605.\n\n administrative costs for government revenue departments and reduce compliance costs for corporate taxpayers. Assets can be transferred between group companies without triggering a tax on gain for the company receiving assets, dividends can be paid between group companies without incurring tax liabilities, and tax attributes of one group company such as imputation credits can be used by other companies in the group. In some jurisdictions there may be other benefits, such as the ability to look through the acquisition of shares of acquired companies to depreciate the underlying assets.\n\n"

In next year's income statement after the good was sold, this company will record a revenue of $100, Cost of Goods Sold of $25, and Cost of Completion and Disposal of $20+$10=$30. This leads to a profit of $100-$25-$30=$45 on this transaction. In this year's income statement, since the NRV ($20) is less than the cost of the good ($25), the NRV will get recorded \n\n whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. In a theoretical situation of unlimited capital budgeting, a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a company's capital constraints limit investments to projects with the highest NPV whose cost cash flows, or initial cash investment, do not exceed the company's capital.\n\n"

Shareholders of a corporation wholly owned by U.S. citizens and resident individuals may elect for the corporation to be taxed similarly to partnerships, as an S Corporation. Shareholders (including other corporations) of corporations (other than S Corporations) are taxed on dividend distributions from the corporation. Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits, nor are they required to gross-up their taxable income. Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000, such excess credits have been refundable. ; At least 90% of the REIT's taxable income has to be distributed to its shareholders through dividends.\n\n"

The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company intends to use positive results from the Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 which includes provisions to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. The secured promissory notes issued under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of 6.40% and are due on July 1, 2018. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for 277,690 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $6.99 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the remaining 177,123 warrants were net exercised for 159,944 shares of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 71,237 warrants were net exercised for 62,525 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 8,230 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.19 per share. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company, Tim Mayleben, and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that the Company, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that the Company announced on May 2, 2018. The term of the lease commences with respect to all of the space in the leased premises on the later to occur of (i) the date upon which landlord delivers the premises to the Company under the terms of the lease with the delivery conditions set forth in the lease satisfied and (ii) November 1, 2018 (the Lease Commencement Date). The term of the lease shall end 60 months after the Lease Commencement Date. Under the terms of the lease, following the first month (during which the base rent is $0) and the second month (during which the base rent is $15,990), the base rent, subject to certain adjustments, for the leased premises will start at approximately $19,412 per month, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and shall increase on an annual basis and/or as otherwise provided in the lease agreement. At June 30, 2018, remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as current on the balance sheets were less than 12 months and remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as long-term were less than two years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on investments of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, and income for the accretion of premiums and discounts on investments of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on available-for-sale investments of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, and expense for the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and require the reporting entity to develop assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2017 Plan was set to 750,000, with any shares of common stock that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon the exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock, or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2017 Plan added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. and available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be cumulatively increased by 2.5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares of common stock determined by the compensation committee. The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs. As of June 30, 2018, there was $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, warrants for common stock, stock options and unvested RSUs are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans, or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those referred to or discussed in or incorporated by reference into the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and we expect to report top-line results in August 2018.\nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and 2) patients who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin, and can be considered statin intolerant. We expect to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. We are also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT,  known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expect the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intend to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy or continue operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred $61.0 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our 1002FDC-053 study, our open-label extension study, our 1002FDC-058 study and our Phase 2 (1002-39) clinical study of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, or PCSK9i, therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred $56.3 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and our Phase 2 (1002-038) clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination plus atorvastatin with bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 12-week, pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of four treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral, fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg alone and effects on other risk markers, including hsCRP, non-HDL-C, apoB and total cholesterol. Study 2 is a 52-week global pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD and/or HeFH, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 24-week LDL-C lowering efficacy, and 52-week safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo. Initiated in June 2018, the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of three treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo and versus ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Safety data will be obtained from an open-label extension study which completed enrollment of 1,462 of the 2,230 patients enrolled in Study 1 in March 2018. Initiated in February 2017, this open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and with ASCVD and/or HeFH whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety in patients treated with bempedoic acid for up to 1.5 years. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 52- and 78-week effects of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB and hsCRP. CLEAR Outcomes is an event driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of bempedoic acid in patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are at high risk for CVD, with hypercholesterolemia and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated CLEAR Outcomes in December 2016, and the study is intended to support our submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. If we fail to complete the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates and secure approval from regulatory authorities, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical studies and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical studies beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical studies, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, patent prosecution, protection and review, consulting and accounting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in connection with the continued research and development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, increases in our headcount, expansion of our information technology infrastructure, and increased expenses associated with being a public company and complying with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. Other income, net, primarily relates to interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and also includes interest expense associated with our credit facility and non-cash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related debt discount, deferred issuance costs and final payment fee. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by us without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were $39.5 million, compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to clinical development costs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was $0.8 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $1.5 million, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness. In June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the credit facility) with Oxford Finance LLC whereby we received net proceeds of $4.9 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under a term loan as part of the facility. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 465,000 additional shares of our common stock, which was exercised in full in September 2017. We invest our cash equivalents and investments in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and government securities to preserve principal. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $82.4 million and $60.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary use of our cash was to fund the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of $61.9 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturities of highly liquid, interest bearing investment-grade and government securities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, related primarily to proceeds from exercise of our common stock options. Net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, related primarily to payments on our credit facility. · the implementation of operational and financial information technology. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or royalty-based financing arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of approximately $24.4 million and $177.4 million at June 30, 2018, and $34.5 million and $239.2 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us, Tim Mayleben and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that we, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that we announced on May 2, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 2 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with those set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. The following risk factors represent new risk factors or those containing changes, including material changes, to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If any of the previously identified or following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years.

If, as a result of such inspection, Tenant discovers deviations or deficiencies from the Working Drawings, then Tenant may deliver a preliminary punch list of such deviations or deficiencies (Punch List Items) to Landlord. The existence of a preliminary punch list shall not postpone the delivery of Expansion Premises as long as (i) the Punch List Items are customarily considered to be punch list items as the term is used in the construction industry, and (ii) neither the failure to complete nor the process of completing any such Punch List Items will delay or unreasonably interfere with Tenants Work or the operation of Tenants business in the Expansion Premises, and (iii) the Punch List Items will not delay Landlord obtaining Tenants certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy, as may be applicable. Subject to force majeure, Landlord shall correct or cure the Punch List Items within thirty (30) days following Landlords receipt of the preliminary punch list, or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary, provided Landlord is proceeding with due diligence to complete the Punch List Items. Landlord may enter the Expansion Premises at any reasonable time with prior notice to Tenant to correct or cure the Punch List Items, provided Landlord takes reasonable precautions to avoid interfering with Tenants Work or Tenants business at the Premises. As used herein, Substantial Completion shall mean the stage in the progress of Landlords Work when Landlords Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with the requirements of the Working Drawings, so that Tenant can (a) occupy or utilize the Expansion Premises for its intended use, or (b) complete any work which could not be completed by Tenant simultaneously with Landlords Work. As used herein, Tenant Delay shall mean any delay in the performance of Landlords Work that occurs as the result of (i) any request or change order by Tenant either that Landlord perform any work in addition to Landlords Work, or that delays, for any reason, Landlord commencing or completing Landlords Work to be performed prior to the delivery of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; (ii) any change by Tenant to the Working Drawings, other than a change required to cause the Working Drawings to conform to applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iii) any failure of Tenant to respond to any request for approval required hereunder within the period specified herein for such response; (iv) any delay in Landlords Work caused by the installation of Tenants fixtures in the Expansion Premises or the performance of any work or activities by Tenant prior to the delivery of possession of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; or (v) failure by Tenant to pay any excess Total Construction Costs over the Tenant Improvement Allowance as invoiced by Landlord. cost of construction, including: labor and materials, architectural, engineering, design, and construction management fees, fees for permits and inspection, tap fees, connection fees and all other hard costs directly related to completion of Landlords Work (Total Construction Costs). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Oxford Design Build, an affiliate of Landlord (the General Contractor), shall be the general contractor for all of Landlords Work, and their construction management fee shall be limited to nine (9%) of the hard costs of the Landlords Work (expressly excluding architectural, engineering, and design fees). In the event the Construction Costs Estimate exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay one-half of the difference to Landlord upon execution by Tenant of this Amendment (Construction Deposit). If the Total Construction Costs of Landlords Work is more than the Tenant Improvement Allowance but less than the sum of the Construction Deposit plus the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Landlord shall refund Tenant the amount by which the Construction Deposit plus Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeded the Total Construction Cost as a credit toward Base Rent. If the Total Construction Costs are less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Landlord shall refund the Construction Deposit received as a credit toward Base Rent, and the remaining difference shall be forfeited with no further obligation of Landlord therefore.

Software size is typically sized in SLOC, Function Point or Agile story points. Cost estimation in software engineering is typically concerned with the financial spend on the effort to develop and test the software, this can also include requirements review, maintenance, training, managing and buying extra equipment, servers and software. Many methods have been developed for estimating software costs for a given project. As of July 31, 2018, the registrant had 42,026,390 shares of common stock outstanding. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We are expensing costs associated with the manufacture of our lebrikizumab product candidate. We review all inventory balances on a quarterly basis for impairment and recognize any reduction in value as a current period expense with a reserve provision on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under certain collaborative arrangements, we have been reimbursed for a portion of our research and development (“R&D”) expenses, including costs of drug supplies. When these R&D services are performed under a reimbursement or cost sharing model with our collaboration partner, we record these reimbursements as a reduction of R&D expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for dilutive potential shares of common stock. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. We expect the implementation of Topic 842 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as we had aggregate future minimum lease payments of approximately $21.6 million as of June 30, 2018. We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. In connection with the acquisition of Valocor Therapeutics, Inc. (“Valocor”) in 2011, we acquired intangible assets that were associated with in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects relating to preclinical product candidates. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. Under Topic 606, we evaluated the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement and the transfer of intellectual property rights (the “license”) was identified as the only performance obligation as of the inception of the agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. Future potential milestone amounts would be recognized as revenue from collaboration arrangements, if unconstrained. Reimbursable program costs are recognized proportionately with the performance of the underlying services or delivery of drug substance and are accounted for as reductions to R&D expense and are excluded from the transaction price. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. The Transition Agreement, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors. In consideration for the repurchase of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, UCB paid us $11.0 million in November 2017 and an additional $39.0 million in June 2018 upon FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis. We are obligated to reimburse UCB for up to $10.0 million of development costs incurred by UCB in connection with the development of Cimzia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. If the aggregate development costs reimbursed by us to UCB during this six-month period are less than $10.0 million, we will pay UCB the difference between such aggregate costs and $10.0 million. These terms replace the provisions of the UCB Agreement pursuant to which we would have been eligible to recoup our external development costs incurred related to the Cimzia program, net of milestones received, through a royalty on future net sales of Cimzia. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $39.0 million milestone amount payable upon the approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in the United States was initially not included in the transaction price, as it was determined to be fully constrained. Upon UCB’s receipt of FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in June 2018, the $39.0 million milestone payment was included in the transaction price and fully recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as all performance obligations were satisfied. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement (“Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”), pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting interleukin 13, for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and a $25.0 million payment to Roche in July 2018 upon the achievement of 50% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab, which was achieved in June 2018, and will make an additional payment to Roche in 2018 for $30.0 million within thirty days after the earlier of December 15, 2018 or the achievement of 100% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for all indications. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement includes a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. As of June 30, 2018, we have paid or accrued license and other fees of $1.8 million to Rose U and are required to pay additional amounts totaling up to $3.1 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, commercialization and other milestones under these agreements to Rose U and Stiefel, including a $2.5 million payment due within thirty days after the first commercial sale of QBREXZA. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. We are entitled to credit the $2.5 million milestone payment against future royalty payments owed to Rose U and Stiefel in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. The interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and other disclosures (including the disclosures under “Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”) pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (the “Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Achieved 50% patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab in June 2018, triggering a $25.0 million milestone payment, which was paid in July 2018. The clinical study is a Phase 2b dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Received a payment of $39.0 million from UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”) in June 2018 in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in May 2018. The payment is pursuant to a transition agreement (“Transition Agreement”) that provided for an orderly transition of activities under the development and commercialisation agreement between us and UCB, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided for the development and commercialization of Cimzia, an injectable biologic tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $38.0 million to $39.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 25% to $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $37.2 million to $39.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 2% to $45.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. We expect to incur significant costs to continue to build out our infrastructure, prepare for the commercial launch of QBREXZA, recently approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older product, and continue to advance our lebrikizumab product candidate through clinical development. The timing and the amount of future funding we will require, and the success of our business, will be based in large part on the successful commercialization of QBREXZA. We currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration or license agreements. Revenue earned under our U.S. Army funded research grant was $509,000 for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $78,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2011. Net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Reduced financial loss from operations to $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.1 million for same period last year. Engaged global contract research organization Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) to manage STOP-TBI Phase IIb trial for Oxycyte PFC Emulsion. Oxygen Biotherapeutics reported net revenue of $514,872 for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $95,159 for the comparable quarter in the previous fiscal year. Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the quarter, we recorded approximately $170,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year. General and administrative expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $369,550 compared to $1,526,775 for the same period in 2011. Research and development expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $604,574 compared to $488,577 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $874,435 compared to $875,695 for the same period in 2011. For the second quarter ended October 31, 2012, the Company reported a net loss of $1,557,278, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,929,923, or $0.12 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Total net revenue for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $786,968 compared to total revenue of $120,032 for the same period in fiscal year 2012. Total operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $3,145,252 compared to $4,602,337 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses. General and administrative expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,593,734 compared to $3,098,431for the same period in 2011. The reduction in general and administrative expense for the period was due primarily to decreases in compensation costs, legal and professional fees, facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, during the period, we reduced our estimate of potential costs associated with our contingent liability, related to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, by approximately $530,000. Research and development expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $1,241,846 compared to $1,140,538 for the same period in 2011. The increase in research and development expense for the period was due primarily to an increase in costs incurred for preclinical studies and Oxycyte development, partially offset by decreases in costs incurred for compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies and facilities costs. Interest and other expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $2,785,535 compared to $1,316,687 for the same period in 2011. The increase in interest and other expenses for the period was due primarily to the non-cash interest charges for dividends and fair value adjustments on our outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock that was not incurred in the prior year, partially offset by the non-cash interest charges for the accretion of the discount on our notes payable which were not incurred in the current period. The Company reported a net loss of $5,143,819, or $0.17 per share for the six month period ended October 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $5,798,992, or $0.25 per share for the same period in 2011. As of October 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,511,513, compared to $1,879,872 at April 30, 2012. Our company's focus is reflected in our financial results and we remain committed to investing a substantial amount of our resources on development of the programs that will lead us to success and build stockholder value.\" The company has developed a proprietary perfluorocarbon (PFC) therapeutic oxygen carrier called Oxycyte® that is currently in clinical and preclinical studies for intravenous delivery for indications such as traumatic brain injury, decompression sickness and stroke.

        "context": "As of August 1, 2018, there were 26,803,675 shares of the registrants Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, outstanding. The Company is the Lipid Management Company, a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing complementary, convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company intends to use positive results from the Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 which includes provisions to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. The secured promissory notes issued under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of 6.40% and are due on July 1, 2018. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for 277,690 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $6.99 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the remaining 177,123 warrants were net exercised for 159,944 shares of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 71,237 warrants were net exercised for 62,525 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 8,230 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.19 per share. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company, Tim Mayleben, and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that the Company, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that the Company announced on May 2, 2018. The term of the lease commences with respect to all of the space in the leased premises on the later to occur of (i) the date upon which landlord delivers the premises to the Company under the terms of the lease with the delivery conditions set forth in the lease satisfied and (ii) November 1, 2018 (the Lease Commencement Date). The term of the lease shall end 60 months after the Lease Commencement Date. Under the terms of the lease, following the first month (during which the base rent is $0) and the second month (during which the base rent is $15,990), the base rent, subject to certain adjustments, for the leased premises will start at approximately $19,412 per month, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and shall increase on an annual basis and/or as otherwise provided in the lease agreement. At June 30, 2018, remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as current on the balance sheets were less than 12 months and remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as long-term were less than two years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on investments of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, and income for the accretion of premiums and discounts on investments of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on available-for-sale investments of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, and expense for the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and require the reporting entity to develop assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2017 Plan was set to 750,000, with any shares of common stock that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon the exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock, or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2017 Plan added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. and available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be cumulatively increased by 2.5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares of common stock determined by the compensation committee. The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs. As of June 30, 2018, there was $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, warrants for common stock, stock options and unvested RSUs are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans, or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those referred to or discussed in or incorporated by reference into the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and we expect to report top-line results in August 2018.\nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and 2) patients who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin, and can be considered statin intolerant. We expect to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. We are also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT,  known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expect the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intend to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy or continue operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred $61.0 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our 1002FDC-053 study, our open-label extension study, our 1002FDC-058 study and our Phase 2 (1002-39) clinical study of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, or PCSK9i, therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred $56.3 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and our Phase 2 (1002-038) clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination plus atorvastatin with bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 12-week, pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of four treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral, fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg alone and effects on other risk markers, including hsCRP, non-HDL-C, apoB and total cholesterol. Study 2 is a 52-week global pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD and/or HeFH, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 24-week LDL-C lowering efficacy, and 52-week safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo. Initiated in June 2018, the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of three treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo and versus ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Safety data will be obtained from an open-label extension study which completed enrollment of 1,462 of the 2,230 patients enrolled in Study 1 in March 2018. Initiated in February 2017, this open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and with ASCVD and/or HeFH whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety in patients treated with bempedoic acid for up to 1.5 years. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 52- and 78-week effects of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB and hsCRP. CLEAR Outcomes is an event driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of bempedoic acid in patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are at high risk for CVD, with hypercholesterolemia and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated CLEAR Outcomes in December 2016, and the study is intended to support our submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. If we fail to complete the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates and secure approval from regulatory authorities, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical studies and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical studies beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical studies, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, patent prosecution, protection and review, consulting and accounting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in connection with the continued research and development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, increases in our headcount, expansion of our information technology infrastructure, and increased expenses associated with being a public company and complying with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. Other income, net, primarily relates to interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and also includes interest expense associated with our credit facility and non-cash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related debt discount, deferred issuance costs and final payment fee. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by us without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were $39.5 million, compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to clinical development costs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was $0.8 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $1.5 million, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness. In June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the credit facility) with Oxford Finance LLC whereby we received net proceeds of $4.9 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under a term loan as part of the facility. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 465,000 additional shares of our common stock, which was exercised in full in September 2017. We invest our cash equivalents and investments in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and government securities to preserve principal. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $82.4 million and $60.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary use of our cash was to fund the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of $61.9 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturities of highly liquid, interest bearing investment-grade and government securities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, related primarily to proceeds from exercise of our common stock options. Net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, related primarily to payments on our credit facility. · the implementation of operational and financial information technology. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or royalty-based financing arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of approximately $24.4 million and $177.4 million at June 30, 2018, and $34.5 million and $239.2 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us, Tim Mayleben and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that we, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that we announced on May 2, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 2 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with those set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. The following risk factors represent new risk factors or those containing changes, including material changes, to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If any of the previously identified or following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. The exhibits filed or furnished as part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are set forth on the Exhibit Index, which Exhibit Index is incorporated herein by reference. First Amendment to Valley Ranch Business Park Lease, dated July 6, 2018, between the Registrant and Blackbird Ann Arbor, LLC. + The certification furnished in Exhibit 32.1 hereto is deemed to be furnished with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and will not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Registrant specifically incorporates it by reference. This FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE (Amendment) entered into this 6th day of July, 2018, (the Execution Date) by and between ESPERION THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (Tenant), and BLACKBIRD ANN ARBOR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Landlord), for the purpose of amending the Valley Ranch Business Park Lease, entered into between Landlords predecessor in interest and Tenant dated February 4, 2014 (as amended to date, Lease). A. Tenant currently leases approximately 7,941 rentable square feet (RSF) of space in Suite 150 (Current Premises) in the building located at 3891 Ranchero Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan (Building) pursuant to the Lease. B. Tenant has requested to expand the Current Premises by approximately 11,471 RSF of space in Suite B200 (Expansion Premises), in the Building and to extend the Term of the Lease. An as-is depiction of the Current Premises and Expansion Premises are set forth on Exhibit A.\nC. Landlord has agreed to the expansion and extension on the terms and conditions contained herein. Expansion Premises. Beginning on the Effective Date (defined below), Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord the Expansion Premises. Thereafter, the Expansion Premises and Current Premises shall collectively be referred to as the Premises under the Lease and shall consist of approximately 19,412 RSF. The Term for the Expansion Premises shall begin on the Effective Date, which shall be the earlier of the date that Landlord substantially completes Landlords Work (defined below) or November 1, 2018, and shall expire sixty (60) full calendar months thereafter (Extended Term). Notwithstanding Article 5(b) of the Lease, beginning on the Effective Date, Tenants Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses, Taxes, Insurance, shall be 65.1%, which is based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the rentable area of the Premises and the denominator of which is the rentable area of the Building. Provided that Tenant is not then in Default of the terms and conditions of the Lease, Tenant shall receive: (i) an abatement of Base Rent in the amount of Twenty-Two Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty-Four and 00/100 Dollars ($22,834.00) on the Effective Date; and (ii) an abatement of Base Rent in the amount of Twenty-Two Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty Four and 00/100 Dollars ($22,834.00) on the thirty-seventh (37th) Month after the Effective Date, to be applied to Tenants Base Rent due or to be paid under the Lease, which abatements are shown in the Base Rent Schedule in Section 3 of this Amendment. Tenant shall be solely responsible, at Tenants sole cost and expense, for installation of all data/IT, low voltage electrical wiring, and for the acquisition and placement of furniture specific to Tenants use of the Premises. (g) Landlord and Tenant each represent and warrant to the other that they have not used the services of any broker or finder other than Oxford Commercial (Landlords Broker) and Swisher Commercial (Tenants Broker), in connection with this Amendment. With the exception of Tenants Broker, Tenant shall indemnify and forever save and hold Landlord harmless from and against claims for brokerage commissions in connection with this Amendment by any person or party claiming by, through or under Tenant. The Current Premises is the approximately 7,941 RSF grey hatched area. The Expansion Premises is the approximately 11,471 RSF area depicted in white. Scope of Work: Landlord shall perform the work (Landlords Work) in the Expansion Premises as described in the Preliminary Plan attached as Exhibit B-1. Within ten (10) days following the execution of this Amendment, to the extent not already selected, Tenant shall select the finish materials and color selections from Landlords Building standard list to be used in the performance of Landlords Work. Upon finalization of the Working Drawings, Landlords contractor shall diligently prosecute Landlords Work to completion without interruption or delay, subject to force majeure events and Tenant Delay (as defined below), in a first-class and good and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the Working Drawings, using new materials (unless otherwise noted in the Working Drawings), and in compliance with all applicable laws. If, as a result of such inspection, Tenant discovers deviations or deficiencies from the Working Drawings, then Tenant may deliver a preliminary punch list of such deviations or deficiencies (Punch List Items) to Landlord. The existence of a preliminary punch list shall not postpone the delivery of Expansion Premises as long as (i) the Punch List Items are customarily considered to be punch list items as the term is used in the construction industry, and (ii) neither the failure to complete nor the process of completing any such Punch List Items will delay or unreasonably interfere with Tenants Work or the operation of Tenants business in the Expansion Premises, and (iii) the Punch List Items will not delay Landlord obtaining Tenants certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy, as may be applicable. Subject to force majeure, Landlord shall correct or cure the Punch List Items within thirty (30) days following Landlords receipt of the preliminary punch list, or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary, provided Landlord is proceeding with due diligence to complete the Punch List Items. Landlord may enter the Expansion Premises at any reasonable time with prior notice to Tenant to correct or cure the Punch List Items, provided Landlord takes reasonable precautions to avoid interfering with Tenants Work or Tenants business at the Premises. As used herein, Substantial Completion shall mean the stage in the progress of Landlords Work when Landlords Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with the requirements of the Working Drawings, so that Tenant can (a) occupy or utilize the Expansion Premises for its intended use, or (b) complete any work which could not be completed by Tenant simultaneously with Landlords Work. As used herein, Tenant Delay shall mean any delay in the performance of Landlords Work that occurs as the result of (i) any request or change order by Tenant either that Landlord perform any work in addition to Landlords Work, or that delays, for any reason, Landlord commencing or completing Landlords Work to be performed prior to the delivery of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; (ii) any change by Tenant to the Working Drawings, other than a change required to cause the Working Drawings to conform to applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iii) any failure of Tenant to respond to any request for approval required hereunder within the period specified herein for such response; (iv) any delay in Landlords Work caused by the installation of Tenants fixtures in the Expansion Premises or the performance of any work or activities by Tenant prior to the delivery of possession of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; or (v) failure by Tenant to pay any excess Total Construction Costs over the Tenant Improvement Allowance as invoiced by Landlord. cost of construction, including: labor and materials, architectural, engineering, design, and construction management fees, fees for permits and inspection, tap fees, connection fees and all other hard costs directly related to completion of Landlords Work (Total Construction Costs). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Oxford Design Build, an affiliate of Landlord (the General Contractor), shall be the general contractor for all of Landlords Work, and their construction management fee shall be limited to nine (9%) of the hard costs of the Landlords Work (expressly excluding architectural, engineering, and design fees). In the event the Construction Costs Estimate exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay one-half of the difference to Landlord upon execution by Tenant of this Amendment (Construction Deposit). If the Total Construction Costs of Landlords Work is more than the Tenant Improvement Allowance but less than the sum of the Construction Deposit plus the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Landlord shall refund Tenant the amount by which the Construction Deposit plus Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeded the Total Construction Cost as a credit toward Base Rent. If the Total Construction Costs are less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Landlord shall refund the Construction Deposit received as a credit toward Base Rent, and the remaining difference shall be forfeited with no further obligation of Landlord therefore.

Software size is typically sized in SLOC, Function Point or Agile story points. Cost estimation in software engineering is typically concerned with the financial spend on the effort to develop and test the software, this can also include requirements review, maintenance, training, managing and buying extra equipment, servers and software. Many methods have been developed for estimating software costs for a given project. As of July 31, 2018, the registrant had 42,026,390 shares of common stock outstanding. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Dermira Canada. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, acquired in-process research and development, investments, accrued research and development expenses, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Inventory costs are determined using the lower of standard cost, which approximates the actual costs determined using the first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval and capitalize the cost of inventory when there is a high probability of future economic benefit. We began capitalizing the cost of inventory related to QBREXZA in the second quarter of 2018, the period in which we received regulatory approval to market the product. We are expensing costs associated with the manufacture of our lebrikizumab product candidate. We review all inventory balances on a quarterly basis for impairment and recognize any reduction in value as a current period expense with a reserve provision on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for revenue recognition accounting policies under Topic 605. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us of one of more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Where a portion of non‑refundable up-front fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The stand-alone selling price may include items such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. Milestone payments that are not within our or our collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration or other revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under certain collaborative arrangements, we have been reimbursed for a portion of our research and development (“R&D”) expenses, including costs of drug supplies. When these R&D services are performed under a reimbursement or cost sharing model with our collaboration partner, we record these reimbursements as a reduction of R&D expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for dilutive potential shares of common stock. In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total amount of restricted cash during the period and other additional disclosures. Net cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 did not change as a result of adopting ASU 2016-18. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. We expect the implementation of Topic 842 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as we had aggregate future minimum lease payments of approximately $21.6 million as of June 30, 2018. We adopted Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method which consists of applying and recognizing the cumulative effect of Topic 606 at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. The cumulative adjustment related primarily to our agreements with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) which are described further in Note 7 Collaboration and License Agreements. Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2—Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. When quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then we estimate fair value by using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model‑based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market‑based observable inputs obtained from various third‑party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, reported trades and broker/dealer quotes. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was $236.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and was based upon observable, Level 2 inputs, including pricing information from recent trades of the convertible notes as of June 30, 2018. See Note 7 for information relating to payments which were measured using unobservable, Level 3 inputs, including a discount rate. In connection with the acquisition of Valocor Therapeutics, Inc. (“Valocor”) in 2011, we acquired intangible assets that were associated with in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects relating to preclinical product candidates. These assets are considered to be indefinite‑lived and are not amortized, but are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if there are changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite‑lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives. We determined that the intangible assets related to this product candidate were considered to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million to IPR&D in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2018. In May 2017, we sold $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (“Notes”) in a private placement. We received net proceeds of $278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts of $8.6 million and issuance costs of $0.6 million. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion rate of 28.2079 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $35.45 per share of common stock. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to May 15, 2022, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. As of June 30, 2018, there were unamortized issuance costs and debt discounts of $7.2 million, which were recorded as a direct deduction from the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which would be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we were to enter into a license agreement for any of our products. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains. In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the existing Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. Under Topic 606, we evaluated the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement and the transfer of intellectual property rights (the “license”) was identified as the only performance obligation as of the inception of the agreement. We concluded that the license for the intellectual property was distinct from our ongoing manufacturing obligations. Future potential milestone amounts would be recognized as revenue from collaboration arrangements, if unconstrained. Reimbursable program costs are recognized proportionately with the performance of the underlying services or delivery of drug substance and are accounted for as reductions to R&D expense and are excluded from the transaction price. Under Topic 606, the entire transaction price of $25.0 million was allocated to the license performance obligation. In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. The Transition Agreement, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors. In consideration for the repurchase of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, UCB paid us $11.0 million in November 2017 and an additional $39.0 million in June 2018 upon FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis. We are obligated to reimburse UCB for up to $10.0 million of development costs incurred by UCB in connection with the development of Cimzia between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. If the aggregate development costs reimbursed by us to UCB during this six-month period are less than $10.0 million, we will pay UCB the difference between such aggregate costs and $10.0 million. These terms replace the provisions of the UCB Agreement pursuant to which we would have been eligible to recoup our external development costs incurred related to the Cimzia program, net of milestones received, through a royalty on future net sales of Cimzia. As of June 30, 2018, we have reimbursed UCB $7.2 million for development costs incurred by UCB between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and the remaining $2.8 million payable to UCB is recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as refund liability. We further determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was comprised of $1.0 million, representing the net consideration from the $11.0 million payment received from UCB and the $10.0 million refund liability due to UCB. The $39.0 million milestone amount payable upon the approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in the United States was initially not included in the transaction price, as it was determined to be fully constrained. Upon UCB’s receipt of FDA approval of Cimzia for the treatment of psoriasis in June 2018, the $39.0 million milestone payment was included in the transaction price and fully recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as all performance obligations were satisfied. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized $39.1 million and $39.4 million in revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations related to UCB. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement (“Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”), pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting interleukin 13, for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and a $25.0 million payment to Roche in July 2018 upon the achievement of 50% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab, which was achieved in June 2018, and will make an additional payment to Roche in 2018 for $30.0 million within thirty days after the earlier of December 15, 2018 or the achievement of 100% enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for all indications. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, our patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab. We determined that the acquired IPR&D related to the Roche Agreement had no alternative future use and recorded an expense of $128.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 in the consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development expense. As of June 30, 2018, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, we recorded $53.9 million in accrued liabilities related to acquired in-process research and development for the $25.0 million paid in July 2018 and the $30.0 million payment which will become payable no later than December 15, 2018. In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement includes a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. As of June 30, 2018, we have paid or accrued license and other fees of $1.8 million to Rose U and are required to pay additional amounts totaling up to $3.1 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, commercialization and other milestones under these agreements to Rose U and Stiefel, including a $2.5 million payment due within thirty days after the first commercial sale of QBREXZA. In addition, we are also obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. We are entitled to credit the $2.5 million milestone payment against future royalty payments owed to Rose U and Stiefel in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. The interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and other disclosures (including the disclosures under “Part II — Other Information, Item 1A. We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. Our approved product, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is an anticholinergic indicated for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”) pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other indications, except Roche retained certain rights, including exclusive rights to develop and promote lebrikizumab for interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (the “Retained Field”), and rights to use lebrikizumab for internal research purposes and for in vitro diagnostic purposes. Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Achieved 50% patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical study of lebrikizumab in June 2018, triggering a $25.0 million milestone payment, which was paid in July 2018. The clinical study is a Phase 2b dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Received a payment of $39.0 million from UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”) in June 2018 in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in May 2018. The payment is pursuant to a transition agreement (“Transition Agreement”) that provided for an orderly transition of activities under the development and commercialisation agreement between us and UCB, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided for the development and commercialization of Cimzia, an injectable biologic tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $38.0 million to $39.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 25% to $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 200% to $40.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net loss increased 22% to $83.2 million from $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. Collaboration and license revenue increased by $37.2 million to $39.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by the $39.0 million revenue recognized pursuant to the Transition Agreement with UCB in connection with the FDA’s approval of Cimzia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Research and development expenses decreased 2% to $45.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by a reduction in clinical trial activities. General and administrative expenses increased 186% to $71.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by expenses related to the planned commercial launch of QBREXZA, as well as headcount growth and associated expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million against intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to our olumacostat glasaretil development program. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities. We expect to incur significant costs to continue to build out our infrastructure, prepare for the commercial launch of QBREXZA, recently approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older product, and continue to advance our lebrikizumab product candidate through clinical development. The timing and the amount of future funding we will require, and the success of our business, will be based in large part on the successful commercialization of QBREXZA. We currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration or license agreements.

Total operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2012 were $1,197,715 compared to $2,149,387 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $80,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $120,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the quarter, we recorded approximately $170,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the three months ended October 31, 2012 was $53,293 compared to $134,035 for the same period in the prior year.

Total operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2012 were $3,145,252 compared to $4,602,337 for the same period in 2011. The reduction in total operating expenses for the period was due primarily to decreases in marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses of approximately $271,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately $100,000 in research and development expense. Additionally, during the period, we recorded approximately $218,000 in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our California lab facility that were not incurred during the same period in the prior year. Marketing and sales expense for the six months ended October 31, 2012 was $91,898 compared to $363,368 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in marketing and sales expense for the period was driven by reductions in compensation costs, direct marketing and advertising costs, fees paid to a third-party public relations firm and travel and marketing sample expenses.

        "origin_prompt": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nBackground:We generated record quarterly net sales for the Company and for our orphan and rheumatology segment, driven by accelerating KRYSTEXXA growth and continued strong performance from our rare disease medicines, said Timothy P. Walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc. These advancements, in addition to potential asset acquisition opportunities, support our strategy to build a robust pipeline enabling sustainable long-term growth. Following the external case series data, the Company is adapting its MIRROR trial to support the potential for registration. Net Sales: Third-quarter 2018 net sales were $325.3 million, an increase of 20 percent, driven by continued strong growth of the Companys orphan and rheumatology medicines. Gross Profit: Under U.S. GAAP in the third quarter of 2018, the gross profit ratio was 69.6 percent compared to 53.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. The non-GAAP gross profit ratio in the third quarter of 2018 was 91.2 percent compared to 89.6 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Operating Expenses: R&D expenses were 6.5 percent of net sales and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 49.7 percent of net sales. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 5.9 percent of net sales and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 39.3 percent of net sales. Weighted average shares outstanding used for calculating GAAP diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2018 were 167.0 million and 172.5 million, respectively. Management uses net sales and segment operating income to evaluate the performance of the Companys two segments. While segment operating income contains certain adjustments to the directly comparable GAAP figures in the Companys consolidated financial results, it is considered to be prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of presenting the Companys segment operating results. Third-quarter 2018 net sales of the orphan and rheumatology segment were $219.9 million, an increase of 25.3 percent over the prior years quarter, driven by continued strong KRYSTEXXA growth as well as growth of RAVICTI and PROCYSBI. As of Sept. 30, 2018, the total principal amount of debt outstanding was $1.993 billion, which consists of $818 million in senior secured term loans due 2024; $300 million senior notes due 2024; $475 million senior notes due 2023 and $400 million exchangeable senior notes due 2022. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA are used and provided by Horizon Pharma as non-GAAP financial measures. Horizon Pharma provides certain other financial measures such as non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit ratio, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP operating cash flow and net debt, each of which include adjustments to GAAP figures. Adjustments to Horizon Pharma’s GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition and/or divestiture-related expenses, charges related to the discontinuation of ACTIMMUNE development for Friedreichs ataxia, gain from divestiture, gain from sale of assets, an upfront fee for a license of a patent, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, costs of debt refinancing, drug manufacturing harmonization costs, restructuring and realignment costs, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, royalty accretion, non-cash interest expense, long-lived asset impairment charges, impacts of contingent royalty liability remeasurements and other non-cash adjustments. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Horizon Pharma has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA outlook to an expected net income (loss) outlook because certain items such as acquisition/divestiture-related expenses and share-based compensation that are a component of net income (loss) cannot be reasonably projected due to the significant impact of changes in Horizon Pharma’s stock price, the variability associated with the size or timing of acquisitions/divestitures and other factors. These components of net income (loss) could significantly impact Horizon Pharmas actual net income (loss). This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Horizon Pharma’s full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance, expected growth in net sales of certain medicines, estimated peak annual net sales of certain medicine and medicine candidates; expected financial performance in future periods; expected timing of clinical trials and regulatory submissions and decisions, including the Phase 3 clinical trial of teprotumumab; expected expansion of investment in Horizon Pharmas rare disease medicine pipeline and marketing of KRYSTEXXA and the impact thereof; potential market opportunity for Horizon Pharmas medicines in approved and potential additional indications; and business and other statements that are not historical facts. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, risks that Horizon Pharmas actual future financial and operating results may differ from its expectations or goals; Horizon Pharmas ability to grow net sales from existing products; the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing from government and third-party payers; risks relating to Horizon Pharmas ability to successfully implement its business strategies; risks inherent in developing novel medicine candidates, such as teprotumumab, and existing medicines for new indications; risks related to acquisition integration and achieving projected benefits; risks associated with regulatory approvals; risks in the ability to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel; competition, including potential generic competition; the ability to protect intellectual property and defend patents; regulatory obligations and oversight, including any changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which Horizon Pharma operates and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in Horizon Pharma’s filings and reports with the SEC.

(7) During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, the Company recognized in cost of goods sold $17.2 million for inventory step-up expense primarily related to KRYSTEXXA inventory sold. During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, the Company recognized in cost of goods sold $54.9 million for inventory step-up expense related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory sold and $40.8 million for inventory step-up expense related to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory sold. (8) Impairments of long-lived assets during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, primarily relates to the write-off of the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due to lower than anticipated future net sales. Impairment of long-lived assets during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017 of $22.3 million relates to an impairment recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was presented in the charges relating to the discontinuation of the Friedreichs ataxia program line item in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures during the year ended December 31, 2017. (9) At the time of the Company’s acquisition of the rights to ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, KRYSTEXXA, MIGERGOT, PROCYSBI, RAVICTI and VIMOVO, the Company estimated the fair value of contingent royalties payable to third parties using an income approach under the discounted cash flow method, which included revenue projections and other assumptions the Company made to determine the fair value. If the Company significantly outperforms or underperforms against its original revenue projections or it becomes necessary to make changes to assumptions as a result of a triggering event, the Company is required to reassess the fair value of the contingent royalties payable. Any subsequent adjustment to fair value is recorded in the period such adjustment is made as either an increase or decrease to royalties payable, with a corresponding increase or decrease in cost of goods sold, in accordance with established accounting policies. The Company recorded net decreases of $2.2 million and $2.9 million to cost of goods sold to adjust the amount of the contingent royalty liabilities relating to PROCYSBI during the first quarter of 2018 and to KRYSTEXXA and VIMOVO during the first quarter of 2017, respectively.

During the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, the Company incurred costs of $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to these activities that qualify for exclusion from the Companys non-GAAP financial measures under its non-GAAP cost policy. (16) Represents upfront and milestone payments related to license agreements. (17) Represents arrangement and other fees relating to the refinancing of the Companys term loans. (18) During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.5 million which comprised a write-off of $0.4 million in debt discount and deferred financing costs and an early redemption payment of $0.1 million. (20) Income tax adjustments on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments represent the estimated income tax impact of each pre-tax non-GAAP adjustment based on the statutory income tax rate of the applicable jurisdictions for each non-GAAP adjustment. In accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118 and the guidance in the notice the Company reinstated the deferred tax asset related to its U.S. interest expense carry forwards under Section 163(j) based on the new U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. The impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118 was a $35.9 million increase to the Companys benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. Phase 3 Data Support Submission of Supplemental New Drug Application for ORKAMBI in Children Ages 6 to 11 with Two Copies of the F508del Mutation in the U.S.\nVertex recently completed a Phase 3 clinical study that was conducted to support the potential approval of ORKAMBI for children with CF as young as six years of age with two copies of the F508del mutation in the U.S. Children in the study received a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of lumacaftor (200mg) and ivacaftor (250mg) for six months. Secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluated the effect on multiple efficacy endpoints including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), lung clearance index and others. Once a new medicine receive approval from Health Canada, it enters the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies (CADTH) Common Drug Review (CDR) process. When an agreement has been reached between the manufacturer and the pCPA, each province and territory determines how the new medicine will be funded. Net Product Revenues from ORKAMBI were $219.9 million. Total combined non-GAAP cost of product revenues and royalty expenses (COR) were $64.2 million, compared to $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 COR expenses included a $13.9 million sales milestone earned by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.\nNon-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $203.8 million compared to $175.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, which includes four Phase 3 studies in more than 1,000 patients. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $78.1 million compared to $60.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of increased investment in global commercial support for the planned launch of ORKAMBI. Non-GAAP net income was $42.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. The net income was the result of ORKAMBI product revenues and increased KALYDECO product revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net Product Revenues from ORKAMBI were $350.7 million. Total combined non-GAAP cost of product revenues and royalty expenses (COR) were $124.9 million, compared to $45.0 million for the full year 2014. Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $764.4 million compared to $694.2 million for the full year 2014. The increased R&D expenses for the full year 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, which includes four Phase 3 studies in more than 1,000 patients. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $295.4 million compared to $225.6 million for the full year 2014. This increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of increased investment in global commercial support for the planned launch of ORKAMBI. Non-GAAP net loss was $268.3 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $511.2 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. The decreased net loss was the result of the first half year of ORKAMBI product revenues and increased KALYDECO product revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, Vertex had $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million. Non-GAAP R&D Expenses: Vertex expects that full-year 2016 non-GAAP R&D expenses will be in the range of $850 to $880 million. The development component of 2016 non-GAAP R&D expenses is expected to increase as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 and other ongoing and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in CF. Non-GAAP SG&A Expenses: Vertex expects that full-year 2016 non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be in the range of $330 to $350 million. The expected increase in SG&A is a result of ongoing investment in the company's commercial infrastructure to support the global launch of ORKAMBI in new markets. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses. In this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs and credits related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters including a one-time 2014 cash payment related to a lease agreement, hepatitis C-related revenues and costs, $75.0 million payment related to our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics AG and other adjustments. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information. Note 1: In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, \"Real estate restructuring costs and income\" consisted of restructuring charges and credits, respectively, related to the company's relocation from Cambridge to Boston, Massachusetts. In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, \"Real estate restructuring costs and income\" consisted of (i) transition costs related to the company's relocation that were recorded as R&D and SG&A, (ii) restructuring charges related to this relocation and (iii) credits recorded to other (expense) income, net to record the effect of the one-time cash payment received related to a lease agreement in the second quarter of 2014. Note 3: In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, \"Other adjustments\" was primarily attributable to a $75.0 million payment related to our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics AG that was recorded as R&D expense, as well as activity related to two variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") that are not associated with the company's collaborations with our collaborators. In each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, \"Other adjustments\" was primarily attributable to development cost associated with VX-509. Note 4: The company consolidates the financial statements of two of its collaborators as VIEs as of December 31, 2015 and consolidated a single VIE as of December 31, 2014. The company's interest and obligations with respect to these VIEs' assets and liabilities are limited to those accorded to the company in its collaboration agreements with these collaborators. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (VIE) reflects the VIEs' cash and cash equivalents, which Vertex does not have any interest in and which will not be used to fund the collaboration. Each reporting period Vertex estimates the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by Vertex to these collaborators. Any increase in the fair value of these contingent milestone and royalty payments results in a decrease in net income attributable to Vertex (or an increase in net loss attributable to Vertex) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The fair value of contingent milestone and royalty payments is evaluated each quarter and any change in the fair value is reflected in the Company's statement of operations. Note 5: In each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the company excludes from its non-GAAP loss attributable to Vertex restructuring expense (income). In addition, in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 discontinued operations related to the effect of the company's relationship with Alios are excluded from its non-GAAP loss attributable to Vertex. This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, Dr. Leiden's statements in the second paragraph of the press release, the information provided in the section captioned \"2016 Financial Guidance\" and statements regarding (i) the sNDA for ORKAMBI for the treatment of patients six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation and the ongoing Phase 3 study in this same patient population and (ii) the target date for the FDA to review the sNDA for the use of KALYDECO in patients ages two and older with one of 23 residual function mutations. While Vertex believes the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are accurate, these forward-looking statements represent the company's beliefs only as of the date of this press release and there are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, that the company's expectations regarding its 2016 revenues and expenses may be incorrect (including because one or more of the company's assumptions underlying its expectations may not be realized), that data from the company's development programs may not support registration or further development of its compounds due to safety, efficacy or other reasons, and other risks listed under Risk Factors in Vertex's annual report and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available through the company's website at www.vrtx.com. 8,188,146 (a pharmaceutical composition patent), a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 12/769,885 and published Reasons for Allowance on five other pending U.S. patent applications targeted at methods of using Vascepa to treat patients in the MARINE patient population. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amarin reported a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2012 of $53.9 million, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.38, including $4.8 million in share-based compensation expense, $1.9 million in warrant compensation expense, and a $18.9 million loss on the change in the fair value of non-cash financial derivative. Excluding non-cash losses for share-based, warrant-based compensation and change in value of derivative, non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $28.3 million for the second quarter of 2012 (basic and diluted loss per share of $0.20) compared to a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $9.9 million (basic and diluted loss per share of $0.08) for the same period in the prior year. Included in this press release and the conference call referenced above are non-GAAP adjusted financial information as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP adjusted financial measure used or discussed, and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP adjusted financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure, are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss was derived by taking GAAP net loss and adjusting it with non-cash gains or losses for share-based, warrant-based compensation, and change in value of derivative. While management believes that this non-GAAP adjusted financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the company's business operations, investors are reminded to consider this non-GAAP measure in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described or projected herein include the following: uncertainties associated generally with the commercial success of new pharmaceutical products, such as Vascepa; Amarin's ability to negotiate and execute a successful acquisition of Amarin or a strategic collaboration with a third party for the commercialization of Vascepa; Amarin's lack of experience with commercializing pharmaceutical products; risks associated with preparations associated with a commercial launch; the risk that FDA may not grant new chemical entity or new product marketing exclusivity to Vascepa; the risk that FDA may not reach a determination with respect to these matters on the timetable that we expect; the risk that patent applications may not result in issued patents, and that issued patents may not prevent competitors from competing with Vascepa; the risk that competitors may challenge the validity, enforceability or both the validity and enforceability of our patents or seek to design products around our issued patent claims and gain marketing approval for generic versions of Vascepa or branded competitive products based on new clinical studies; and the risk that trade secrets may not be maintained and that circumstances that create manufacturing barriers to entry may not last. Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Excluding non-cash stock and warrant based compensation, research and development expenses were $12,924 and $4,959 for the three months ending June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively and marketing, general and administrative expenses were $8,085 and $3,400, respectively, for the same periods. (2) Non-cash charges result from changes in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability. This liability is revalued at each reporting period and, upon exercise of warrants, is reclassified at fair value from liability to stockholders' equity. The following is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by Amarin to describe its financial results determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Information\" above. Under IFRS, companies need to record the cost of their Ending Inventory at the lower of cost and NRV, to ensure that their inventory and income statement are not overstated (under ASPE, companies record the lower of cost and market value). For example, under IFRS, at a company's year end, if an unfinished good that already cost $25 is expected to sell for $100 to a customer, but it will take an additional $20 to complete and $10 to advertise to the customer, its NRV will be $100-$20-$10=$70.

        "context": "We generated record quarterly net sales for the Company and for our orphan and rheumatology segment, driven by accelerating KRYSTEXXA growth and continued strong performance from our rare disease medicines, said Timothy P. Walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc. These advancements, in addition to potential asset acquisition opportunities, support our strategy to build a robust pipeline enabling sustainable long-term growth. Following the external case series data, the Company is adapting its MIRROR trial to support the potential for registration. Net Sales: Third-quarter 2018 net sales were $325.3 million, an increase of 20 percent, driven by continued strong growth of the Companys orphan and rheumatology medicines. Gross Profit: Under U.S. GAAP in the third quarter of 2018, the gross profit ratio was 69.6 percent compared to 53.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. The non-GAAP gross profit ratio in the third quarter of 2018 was 91.2 percent compared to 89.6 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Operating Expenses: R&D expenses were 6.5 percent of net sales and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 49.7 percent of net sales. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 5.9 percent of net sales and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 39.3 percent of net sales. Weighted average shares outstanding used for calculating GAAP diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2018 were 167.0 million and 172.5 million, respectively. Management uses net sales and segment operating income to evaluate the performance of the Companys two segments. While segment operating income contains certain adjustments to the directly comparable GAAP figures in the Companys consolidated financial results, it is considered to be prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of presenting the Companys segment operating results. Third-quarter 2018 net sales of the orphan and rheumatology segment were $219.9 million, an increase of 25.3 percent over the prior years quarter, driven by continued strong KRYSTEXXA growth as well as growth of RAVICTI and PROCYSBI. As of Sept. 30, 2018, the total principal amount of debt outstanding was $1.993 billion, which consists of $818 million in senior secured term loans due 2024; $300 million senior notes due 2024; $475 million senior notes due 2023 and $400 million exchangeable senior notes due 2022. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA are used and provided by Horizon Pharma as non-GAAP financial measures. Horizon Pharma provides certain other financial measures such as non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit ratio, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP operating cash flow and net debt, each of which include adjustments to GAAP figures. Adjustments to Horizon Pharma’s GAAP figures as well as EBITDA exclude acquisition and/or divestiture-related expenses, charges related to the discontinuation of ACTIMMUNE development for Friedreichs ataxia, gain from divestiture, gain from sale of assets, an upfront fee for a license of a patent, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, costs of debt refinancing, drug manufacturing harmonization costs, restructuring and realignment costs, as well as non-cash items such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, royalty accretion, non-cash interest expense, long-lived asset impairment charges, impacts of contingent royalty liability remeasurements and other non-cash adjustments. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Horizon Pharma has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA outlook to an expected net income (loss) outlook because certain items such as acquisition/divestiture-related expenses and share-based compensation that are a component of net income (loss) cannot be reasonably projected due to the significant impact of changes in Horizon Pharma’s stock price, the variability associated with the size or timing of acquisitions/divestitures and other factors. These components of net income (loss) could significantly impact Horizon Pharmas actual net income (loss). This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Horizon Pharma’s full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance, expected growth in net sales of certain medicines, estimated peak annual net sales of certain medicine and medicine candidates; expected financial performance in future periods; expected timing of clinical trials and regulatory submissions and decisions, including the Phase 3 clinical trial of teprotumumab; expected expansion of investment in Horizon Pharmas rare disease medicine pipeline and marketing of KRYSTEXXA and the impact thereof; potential market opportunity for Horizon Pharmas medicines in approved and potential additional indications; and business and other statements that are not historical facts. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, risks that Horizon Pharmas actual future financial and operating results may differ from its expectations or goals; Horizon Pharmas ability to grow net sales from existing products; the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing from government and third-party payers; risks relating to Horizon Pharmas ability to successfully implement its business strategies; risks inherent in developing novel medicine candidates, such as teprotumumab, and existing medicines for new indications; risks related to acquisition integration and achieving projected benefits; risks associated with regulatory approvals; risks in the ability to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel; competition, including potential generic competition; the ability to protect intellectual property and defend patents; regulatory obligations and oversight, including any changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which Horizon Pharma operates and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in Horizon Pharma’s filings and reports with the SEC. Amounts include restricted cash balance in accordance with ASU No. (1) Represents expenses, including legal and consulting fees, incurred in connection with the Companys acquisitions and divestitures. (2) Represents expenses, including severance costs and consulting fees, related to the restructuring and realignment activities. (3) The Company recorded $1.5 million of expense during the three months ended Sept. 30, 2018, and $5.8 million of expense during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, for litigation settlements related to PENNSAID 2% and RAVICTI. (4) Intangible amortization expenses are associated with the Companys intellectual property rights, developed technology and customer relationships related to ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, KRYSTEXXA, LODOTRA, MIGERGOT, PENNSAID 2%, PROCYSBI, RAVICTI, RAYOS and VIMOVO. (5) Represents accretion expense associated with ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, KRYSTEXXA, MIGERGOT, PROCYSBI, QUINSAIR, RAVICTI and VIMOVO contingent royalty liabilities. (6) Represents amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the Company’s debt. (7) During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, the Company recognized in cost of goods sold $17.2 million for inventory step-up expense primarily related to KRYSTEXXA inventory sold. During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, the Company recognized in cost of goods sold $54.9 million for inventory step-up expense related to KRYSTEXXA and MIGERGOT inventory sold and $40.8 million for inventory step-up expense related to PROCYSBI and QUINSAIR inventory sold. (8) Impairments of long-lived assets during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, primarily relates to the write-off of the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America due to lower than anticipated future net sales. Impairment of long-lived assets during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017 of $22.3 million relates to an impairment recorded following payment to Boehringer Ingelheim International for the acquisition of certain rights to interferon gamma-1b. This was presented in the charges relating to the discontinuation of the Friedreichs ataxia program line item in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures during the year ended December 31, 2017. (9) At the time of the Company’s acquisition of the rights to ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL, KRYSTEXXA, MIGERGOT, PROCYSBI, RAVICTI and VIMOVO, the Company estimated the fair value of contingent royalties payable to third parties using an income approach under the discounted cash flow method, which included revenue projections and other assumptions the Company made to determine the fair value. If the Company significantly outperforms or underperforms against its original revenue projections or it becomes necessary to make changes to assumptions as a result of a triggering event, the Company is required to reassess the fair value of the contingent royalties payable. Any subsequent adjustment to fair value is recorded in the period such adjustment is made as either an increase or decrease to royalties payable, with a corresponding increase or decrease in cost of goods sold, in accordance with established accounting policies. The Company recorded net decreases of $2.2 million and $2.9 million to cost of goods sold to adjust the amount of the contingent royalty liabilities relating to PROCYSBI during the first quarter of 2018 and to KRYSTEXXA and VIMOVO during the first quarter of 2017, respectively. (10) Represents share-based compensation expense associated with the Company’s stock option, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants to its employees and non-employees, its previous cash-settled long-term incentive plan and its employee stock purchase plan. (11) Represents depreciation expense related to the Companys property, equipment, software and leasehold improvements. (14) During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, the Company recorded charges relating to the discontinuation of the Friedreichs ataxia program of $1.5 million. During the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2018, the Company incurred costs of $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to these activities that qualify for exclusion from the Companys non-GAAP financial measures under its non-GAAP cost policy. (16) Represents upfront and milestone payments related to license agreements. (17) Represents arrangement and other fees relating to the refinancing of the Companys term loans. (18) During the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.5 million which comprised a write-off of $0.4 million in debt discount and deferred financing costs and an early redemption payment of $0.1 million. (20) Income tax adjustments on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments represent the estimated income tax impact of each pre-tax non-GAAP adjustment based on the statutory income tax rate of the applicable jurisdictions for each non-GAAP adjustment. In accordance with the measurement period provisions under SAB 118 and the guidance in the notice the Company reinstated the deferred tax asset related to its U.S. interest expense carry forwards under Section 163(j) based on the new U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. The impact of the deferred tax asset reinstatement in accordance with SAB 118 was a $35.9 million increase to the Companys benefit for income taxes and a corresponding decrease to the U.S. group net deferred tax liability position. Phase 3 Data Support Submission of Supplemental New Drug Application for ORKAMBI in Children Ages 6 to 11 with Two Copies of the F508del Mutation in the U.S.\nVertex recently completed a Phase 3 clinical study that was conducted to support the potential approval of ORKAMBI for children with CF as young as six years of age with two copies of the F508del mutation in the U.S. Children in the study received a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of lumacaftor (200mg) and ivacaftor (250mg) for six months. Secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluated the effect on multiple efficacy endpoints including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), lung clearance index and others. Once a new medicine receive approval from Health Canada, it enters the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies (CADTH) Common Drug Review (CDR) process. When an agreement has been reached between the manufacturer and the pCPA, each province and territory determines how the new medicine will be funded. Net Product Revenues from ORKAMBI were $219.9 million. Total combined non-GAAP cost of product revenues and royalty expenses (COR) were $64.2 million, compared to $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 COR expenses included a $13.9 million sales milestone earned by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.\nNon-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $203.8 million compared to $175.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, which includes four Phase 3 studies in more than 1,000 patients. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $78.1 million compared to $60.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of increased investment in global commercial support for the planned launch of ORKAMBI. Non-GAAP net income was $42.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. The net income was the result of ORKAMBI product revenues and increased KALYDECO product revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net Product Revenues from ORKAMBI were $350.7 million. Total combined non-GAAP cost of product revenues and royalty expenses (COR) were $124.9 million, compared to $45.0 million for the full year 2014. Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $764.4 million compared to $694.2 million for the full year 2014. The increased R&D expenses for the full year 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, which includes four Phase 3 studies in more than 1,000 patients. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $295.4 million compared to $225.6 million for the full year 2014. This increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of increased investment in global commercial support for the planned launch of ORKAMBI. Non-GAAP net loss was $268.3 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $511.2 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. The decreased net loss was the result of the first half year of ORKAMBI product revenues and increased KALYDECO product revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, Vertex had $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million. Non-GAAP R&D Expenses: Vertex expects that full-year 2016 non-GAAP R&D expenses will be in the range of $850 to $880 million. The development component of 2016 non-GAAP R&D expenses is expected to increase as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 and other ongoing and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in CF. Non-GAAP SG&A Expenses: Vertex expects that full-year 2016 non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be in the range of $330 to $350 million. The expected increase in SG&A is a result of ongoing investment in the company's commercial infrastructure to support the global launch of ORKAMBI in new markets. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses. In this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results exclude stock-based compensation expense, costs and credits related to the relocation of the company's corporate headquarters including a one-time 2014 cash payment related to a lease agreement, hepatitis C-related revenues and costs, $75.0 million payment related to our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics AG and other adjustments. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information. Note 1: In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, \"Real estate restructuring costs and income\" consisted of restructuring charges and credits, respectively, related to the company's relocation from Cambridge to Boston, Massachusetts. In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, \"Real estate restructuring costs and income\" consisted of (i) transition costs related to the company's relocation that were recorded as R&D and SG&A, (ii) restructuring charges related to this relocation and (iii) credits recorded to other (expense) income, net to record the effect of the one-time cash payment received related to a lease agreement in the second quarter of 2014. Note 3: In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, \"Other adjustments\" was primarily attributable to a $75.0 million payment related to our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics AG that was recorded as R&D expense, as well as activity related to two variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") that are not associated with the company's collaborations with our collaborators. In each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, \"Other adjustments\" was primarily attributable to development cost associated with VX-509. Note 4: The company consolidates the financial statements of two of its collaborators as VIEs as of December 31, 2015 and consolidated a single VIE as of December 31, 2014. The company's interest and obligations with respect to these VIEs' assets and liabilities are limited to those accorded to the company in its collaboration agreements with these collaborators. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (VIE) reflects the VIEs' cash and cash equivalents, which Vertex does not have any interest in and which will not be used to fund the collaboration. Each reporting period Vertex estimates the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by Vertex to these collaborators. Any increase in the fair value of these contingent milestone and royalty payments results in a decrease in net income attributable to Vertex (or an increase in net loss attributable to Vertex) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The fair value of contingent milestone and royalty payments is evaluated each quarter and any change in the fair value is reflected in the Company's statement of operations. Note 5: In each of the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the company excludes from its non-GAAP loss attributable to Vertex restructuring expense (income). In addition, in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 discontinued operations related to the effect of the company's relationship with Alios are excluded from its non-GAAP loss attributable to Vertex. This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, Dr. Leiden's statements in the second paragraph of the press release, the information provided in the section captioned \"2016 Financial Guidance\" and statements regarding (i) the sNDA for ORKAMBI for the treatment of patients six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation and the ongoing Phase 3 study in this same patient population and (ii) the target date for the FDA to review the sNDA for the use of KALYDECO in patients ages two and older with one of 23 residual function mutations. While Vertex believes the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are accurate, these forward-looking statements represent the company's beliefs only as of the date of this press release and there are a number of factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, that the company's expectations regarding its 2016 revenues and expenses may be incorrect (including because one or more of the company's assumptions underlying its expectations may not be realized), that data from the company's development programs may not support registration or further development of its compounds due to safety, efficacy or other reasons, and other risks listed under Risk Factors in Vertex's annual report and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available through the company's website at www.vrtx.com. 8,188,146 (a pharmaceutical composition patent), a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 12/769,885 and published Reasons for Allowance on five other pending U.S. patent applications targeted at methods of using Vascepa to treat patients in the MARINE patient population. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amarin reported a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2012 of $53.9 million, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.38, including $4.8 million in share-based compensation expense, $1.9 million in warrant compensation expense, and a $18.9 million loss on the change in the fair value of non-cash financial derivative. Excluding non-cash losses for share-based, warrant-based compensation and change in value of derivative, non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $28.3 million for the second quarter of 2012 (basic and diluted loss per share of $0.20) compared to a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $9.9 million (basic and diluted loss per share of $0.08) for the same period in the prior year. Included in this press release and the conference call referenced above are non-GAAP adjusted financial information as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP adjusted financial measure used or discussed, and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP adjusted financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure, are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss was derived by taking GAAP net loss and adjusting it with non-cash gains or losses for share-based, warrant-based compensation, and change in value of derivative. While management believes that this non-GAAP adjusted financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the company's business operations, investors are reminded to consider this non-GAAP measure in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described or projected herein include the following: uncertainties associated generally with the commercial success of new pharmaceutical products, such as Vascepa; Amarin's ability to negotiate and execute a successful acquisition of Amarin or a strategic collaboration with a third party for the commercialization of Vascepa; Amarin's lack of experience with commercializing pharmaceutical products; risks associated with preparations associated with a commercial launch; the risk that FDA may not grant new chemical entity or new product marketing exclusivity to Vascepa; the risk that FDA may not reach a determination with respect to these matters on the timetable that we expect; the risk that patent applications may not result in issued patents, and that issued patents may not prevent competitors from competing with Vascepa; the risk that competitors may challenge the validity, enforceability or both the validity and enforceability of our patents or seek to design products around our issued patent claims and gain marketing approval for generic versions of Vascepa or branded competitive products based on new clinical studies; and the risk that trade secrets may not be maintained and that circumstances that create manufacturing barriers to entry may not last. Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Excluding non-cash stock and warrant based compensation, research and development expenses were $12,924 and $4,959 for the three months ending June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively and marketing, general and administrative expenses were $8,085 and $3,400, respectively, for the same periods. (2) Non-cash charges result from changes in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability. This liability is revalued at each reporting period and, upon exercise of warrants, is reclassified at fair value from liability to stockholders' equity. The following is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by Amarin to describe its financial results determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Information\" above. Under IFRS, companies need to record the cost of their Ending Inventory at the lower of cost and NRV, to ensure that their inventory and income statement are not overstated (under ASPE, companies record the lower of cost and market value). For example, under IFRS, at a company's year end, if an unfinished good that already cost $25 is expected to sell for $100 to a customer, but it will take an additional $20 to complete and $10 to advertise to the customer, its NRV will be $100-$20-$10=$70. In this year's income statement, since the cost of the good \n\n issuer had been members of the accounting firm's audit engagement team within the one-year period preceding the commencement of audit procedures; ; require that the auditor of an issuer's financial statements report certain matters to the issuer's audit committee, including \"critical\" accounting policies used by the issuer; and require disclosures to investors of information related to audit and non-audit services provided by, and fees paid to, the auditor of the issuer's financial statements. ; In addition, under the final rules, an accountant would not be independent from an audit client if an audit partner received compensation based on selling engagements to that client for services other than audit,\n\n"

Where the BUYER expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the BUYER relies on the seller’s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose” Does the provision of the Uniform Sales Act §15(1) that provides,  include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied? “Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment, whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.” Plaintiff entered defendant's restaurant and ordered \"New York baked beans and corned beef.\" Plaintiff appeals her contract claim, arguing that the defendant breached an implied warranty under the Uniform Sales Act (St. 1908 c. 237 §15(1), predecessor of UCC Article 2), which says that:\n\n purpose is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow. In the United States, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (which has been adopted with variations in each state) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an \"as is\" statement): \n\n his obligations, and \"warranties\" the breach of which does not give rise to such an event.

Where the BUYER expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the BUYER relies on the seller’s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose” Does the provision of the Uniform Sales Act §15(1) that provides,  include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied? “Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment, whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.” Plaintiff entered defendant's restaurant and ordered \"New York baked beans and corned beef.\" Plaintiff appeals her contract claim, arguing that the defendant breached an implied warranty under the Uniform Sales Act (St. 1908 c. 237 §15(1), predecessor of UCC Article 2), which says that:\n\n purpose is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow. In the United States, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (which has been adopted with variations in each state) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an \"as is\" statement): \n\n his obligations, and \"warranties\" the breach of which does not give rise to such an event.
