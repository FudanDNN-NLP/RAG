Three multiples can be subtracted (q1 = 3), leaving a remainder of 21:  462 = 3 × 147 + 21. Then multiples of 21 are subtracted from 147 until the remainder is less than 21.

        "prediction": "The correct answer is D. 125.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the distance represented by 5 inches on the map, we need to multiply the length of 1 inch (which represents 25 miles) by 5.\n\n1 inch = 25",

Russia, England, Belgium, Holland, Spain, and Portugal presented their bids in Zurich on 2 December 2010. Igor Shuvalov was part of the Russian delegation together with the Minister of Sports, Tourism, and Youth Policy, Vitaly Mutko, and football player Andrei Arshavin. In January 2011, the honorary president of the Russian Football Union, Vyacheslav Koloskov, suggested that Igor Shuvalov should head the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup. As part of the government formed in May 2012, Igor Shuvalov, among other things, \n\n the organization, preparation, and holding of the World Cup in 2018, including the issues of creating and developing the necessary transport infrastructure. In March 2013, it was announced that the regions had requested 540 billion roubles to prepare for World Cup 2018, but the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Igor Shuvalov, stated that the amount was excessive.
