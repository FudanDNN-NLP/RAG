Atrophic gastritis is a condition where the stomach lining becomes thin and inflamed, leading to a decrease in intrinsic factor production. Small bowel resection involves surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine, which can result in reduced absorption of vitamin B12. These conditions interfere with the normal process of absorbing vitamin B12 from food sources, leading to a deficiency if not properly addressed. Reference:\n- Pernicious anemia (also called Addison's anemia) is a type of red blood cell disorder caused by impaired vitamin B12 metabolism. Vitamin B12 is primarily absorbed by the small intestine, after being bound to intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa. When this process is disrupted by conditions like atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, small bowel resection etc., B12 deficiency ensues. Substantial numbers of patients with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems in the absence of or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria. Type A gastritis primarily affects the body/fundus of the stomach and is more common with pernicious anemia.Type B gastritis primarily affects the antrum, and is more common with H. pylori infection.

        "context": "Some conditions that can disrupt the absorption of vitamin B12 and lead to B12 deficiency include atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, and small bowel resection. Atrophic gastritis is a condition where the stomach lining becomes thin and inflamed, leading to a decrease in intrinsic factor production. Small bowel resection involves surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine, which can result in reduced absorption of vitamin B12. These conditions interfere with the normal process of absorbing vitamin B12 from food sources, leading to a deficiency if not properly addressed. Reference:\n- Pernicious anemia (also called Addison's anemia) is a type of red blood cell disorder caused by impaired vitamin B12 metabolism. Vitamin B12 is primarily absorbed by the small intestine, after being bound to intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa. When this process is disrupted by conditions like atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, small bowel resection etc., B12 deficiency ensues. Substantial numbers of patients with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems in the absence of or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia.

The most demanding essential amino acid requirements are for infants, and as children get older and transition into adulthood, the less proportions of essential amino acids they will need. The essential amino acid requirements for infants is based on the essential amino acid proportions in human breast milk. In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12).Humans must consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day because an equivalent amount of amino acids is oxidized or used for the synthesis of nonprotein compounds. 34.10 Protein and amino acid content and turnover in a healthy adult. ### 4.2 Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids\n\nHumans cannot synthesize His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, or Val; therefore, these amino acids are called essential (or indispensable) amino acids. For growing children, this list has to be expanded; they must consume Arg because they commonly do not produce enough of it in the urea cycle (see Section 2.5 in Chapter 35) and Cys because they do not make enough of it from methionine (see Sections 4.1 and  in Chapter 36). Gln, Tyr, Gly, Pro, and ornithine are conditionally essential amino acids; that is, they are essential in certain disease conditions. For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12). In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For people who eat mostly a vegan diet, methionine is usually the limiting essential amino acid.Adults should consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day.For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum intake of 0.75 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day; this protein should have a good balance of amino acids. RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance; AI= Adequate intake; UL = Tolerable upper intake level; Figures shown are for adults age 31-50, male or female neither pregnant nor lactating One serving of seaweed exceeds the US UL of 1100 μg but not the 3000 μg UL set by Japan. In addition, cysteine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids, and taurine a semiessential aminosulfonic acid in children. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the nonstandard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is indicated for the nutritional support of infants (including those of low birth weight) and young children requiring TPN via either central or peripheral infusion routes. Parenteral nutrition with Aminosyn-PF 10% is indicated to prevent nitrogen and weight loss or treat negative nitrogen balance in infants and young children where (1) the alimentary tract by the oral gastrostomy, or jejunostomy route, cannot or should not be used or adequate protein intake is not feasible by these routes; (2) gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired; or (3) protein requirements are substantially increased as with extensive burns. Dosage, route of administration, and concomitant infusion of non-protein calories are dependent on various factors, such as nutritional and metabolic status of the patient, anticipated duration of parenteral nutrition support, and vein tolerance. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, is an amino acid injection-pediatric formula not intended for direct infusion. The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn-PF 10% is up to 2.5 g amino acid/kg/day for infants up to 10 kg. For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids/day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1.0 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg. Initial amino acid dosage levels of 1.0 g/kg/day may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 g/kg/day to approximate desired intake levels. Nonprotein calories should constitute approximately 100 to 130 kcal/kg/day. Part of the nonprotein caloric requirement may be provided as lipid emulsion administered concurrently to provide up to 60% of daily calories at a dose not to exceed 4 g fat/kg/day. Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged (more than 5 days) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid for infants, especially preterm infants with potentially immature enzyme pathways. Therefore, addition of a cysteine supplement to the TPN admixture is recommended. The intake of cysteine by the preterm infant ingesting maternal milk is approximately 78 mg/kg/day. The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn-PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP). Bicarbonate should not be administered during infusion of the nutritional solution unless deemed absolutely necessary. Hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava. In addition to meeting protein needs, the rate of administration, particularly during the first few days of therapy, is governed by the patient's glucose tolerance. Daily intake of amino acids and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of glucose levels in blood and urine. The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture. Aminosyn -PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is supplied as a Pharmacy Bulk Package in 1000 mL flexible plastic containers List 4179. Local reactions consisting of erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids particularly if other substances, such as antibiotics, are also administered through the same site. FREQUENT EVALUATION AND LABORATORY DETERMINATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR PROPER MONITORING OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION. Studies should include blood sugar, serum proteins, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, hemogram, carbon dioxide content, serum osmolalities, blood cultures, and blood ammonia levels. It is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants. Conservative doses of amino acids should be given, dictated by the nutritional status of the patient. The effect of infusion of amino acids, without dextrose, upon carbohydrate metabolism of children is not known at this time. It is essential to provide adequate exogenous dextrose calories concurrently with amino acids. Correction of this ketonemia may be achieved by the administration of carbohydrate. Peripheral administration of Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) requires appropriate dilution and provision of adequate calories. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no added phosphorus. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is contraindicated in patients with untreated anuria, hepatic coma, inborn errors of amino acid metabolism (including those involving branched chain amino acid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease and isovaleric acidemia), or hypersensitivity to one or more amino acids present in the solution. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) contains a mixture of essential and nonessential amino acids as well as taurine. The amino acid composition has been specifically formulated to provide a well-tolerated nitrogen source for nutritional support and therapy for infants and young children. When administered in conjunction with a cysteine hydrochloride additive, Aminosyn-PF 10% results in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating a profile consistent with that of a breast-fed infant. The rationale for Aminosyn-PF 10% is based on the observation of inadequate levels of essential amino acids in the plasma of infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) using conventional amino acid solutions. Clinical studies in infants who required TPN therapy showed that infusion of Aminosyn-PF 10% resulted in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating those of normal breast or formula fed infants. When infused with hypertonic dextrose as a calorie source, supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals, Aminosyn-PF 10% provides TPN for infants and young children, with the exception of essential fatty acids. The amounts of sodium and acetate in Aminosyn-PF 10% are not of clinical significance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about nutrition.

For growing children, this list has to be expanded; they must consume Arg because they commonly do not produce enough of it in the urea cycle (see Section 2.5 in Chapter 35) and Cys because they do not make enough of it from methionine (see Sections 4.1 and  in Chapter 36). Gln, Tyr, Gly, Pro, and ornithine are conditionally essential amino acids; that is, they are essential in certain disease conditions. For instance, gelatin (as contained in Jell-O) is a very low-quality protein because it consists mostly of collagen, which contains mostly glycine, proline (some of it as hydroxyproline), and alanine (see Chapter 12). In contrast, human breast milk is a source of very high-quality protein for infants because the amino acid composition of milk proteins closely matches the requirements.For people who eat mostly a vegan diet, methionine is usually the limiting essential amino acid.Adults should consume a minimum of about 50 g of protein per day.For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum intake of 0.75 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day; this protein should have a good balance of amino acids. RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance; AI= Adequate intake; UL = Tolerable upper intake level; Figures shown are for adults age 31-50, male or female neither pregnant nor lactating One serving of seaweed exceeds the US UL of 1100 μg but not the 3000 μg UL set by Japan. In addition, cysteine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids, and taurine a semiessential aminosulfonic acid in children. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the nonstandard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is indicated for the nutritional support of infants (including those of low birth weight) and young children requiring TPN via either central or peripheral infusion routes. Parenteral nutrition with Aminosyn-PF 10% is indicated to prevent nitrogen and weight loss or treat negative nitrogen balance in infants and young children where (1) the alimentary tract by the oral gastrostomy, or jejunostomy route, cannot or should not be used or adequate protein intake is not feasible by these routes; (2) gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired; or (3) protein requirements are substantially increased as with extensive burns. Dosage, route of administration, and concomitant infusion of non-protein calories are dependent on various factors, such as nutritional and metabolic status of the patient, anticipated duration of parenteral nutrition support, and vein tolerance. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, is an amino acid injection-pediatric formula not intended for direct infusion. The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn-PF 10% is up to 2.5 g amino acid/kg/day for infants up to 10 kg. For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids/day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1.0 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg. Initial amino acid dosage levels of 1.0 g/kg/day may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 g/kg/day to approximate desired intake levels. Nonprotein calories should constitute approximately 100 to 130 kcal/kg/day. Part of the nonprotein caloric requirement may be provided as lipid emulsion administered concurrently to provide up to 60% of daily calories at a dose not to exceed 4 g fat/kg/day. Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged (more than 5 days) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid for infants, especially preterm infants with potentially immature enzyme pathways. Therefore, addition of a cysteine supplement to the TPN admixture is recommended. The intake of cysteine by the preterm infant ingesting maternal milk is approximately 78 mg/kg/day. The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn-PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP). Bicarbonate should not be administered during infusion of the nutritional solution unless deemed absolutely necessary. Hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava. In addition to meeting protein needs, the rate of administration, particularly during the first few days of therapy, is governed by the patient's glucose tolerance. Daily intake of amino acids and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of glucose levels in blood and urine. The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture. Aminosyn -PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is supplied as a Pharmacy Bulk Package in 1000 mL flexible plastic containers List 4179. Local reactions consisting of erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids particularly if other substances, such as antibiotics, are also administered through the same site. FREQUENT EVALUATION AND LABORATORY DETERMINATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR PROPER MONITORING OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION. Studies should include blood sugar, serum proteins, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, hemogram, carbon dioxide content, serum osmolalities, blood cultures, and blood ammonia levels. It is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants. Conservative doses of amino acids should be given, dictated by the nutritional status of the patient. The effect of infusion of amino acids, without dextrose, upon carbohydrate metabolism of children is not known at this time. It is essential to provide adequate exogenous dextrose calories concurrently with amino acids. Correction of this ketonemia may be achieved by the administration of carbohydrate. Peripheral administration of Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) requires appropriate dilution and provision of adequate calories. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no added phosphorus. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration. Aminosyn-PF 10% contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is contraindicated in patients with untreated anuria, hepatic coma, inborn errors of amino acid metabolism (including those involving branched chain amino acid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease and isovaleric acidemia), or hypersensitivity to one or more amino acids present in the solution. Aminosyn-PF 10%, Sulfite-Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) contains a mixture of essential and nonessential amino acids as well as taurine. The amino acid composition has been specifically formulated to provide a well-tolerated nitrogen source for nutritional support and therapy for infants and young children. When administered in conjunction with a cysteine hydrochloride additive, Aminosyn-PF 10% results in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating a profile consistent with that of a breast-fed infant. The rationale for Aminosyn-PF 10% is based on the observation of inadequate levels of essential amino acids in the plasma of infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) using conventional amino acid solutions. Clinical studies in infants who required TPN therapy showed that infusion of Aminosyn-PF 10% resulted in plasma amino acid concentrations approximating those of normal breast or formula fed infants. When infused with hypertonic dextrose as a calorie source, supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals, Aminosyn-PF 10% provides TPN for infants and young children, with the exception of essential fatty acids. The amounts of sodium and acetate in Aminosyn-PF 10% are not of clinical significance.\n\n"

By replacing dietary saturated fats with n-3 fatty acids, several positive effects on cardiovascular health can be observed. Moreover, increasing the intake of n-3 fatty acids can shift the balance of eicosanoid production in the vessel wall, favoring the synthesis of vasodilatory and anti-aggregatory metabolites. Furthermore, n-3 fatty acids have been found to reduce the production of pro-atherosclerotic growth factors by mononuclear cells. Studies have also suggested that n-3 fatty acids may offer particular protection against sudden cardiac death. Animal studies have shown that these fatty acids reduce the predisposition to ventricular fibrillation, a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. It is believed that the incorporation of n-3 fatty acids into the cell membrane of heart muscle cells provides resistance to arrhythmias by modulating the electrical conductance of membrane ion channels.

By replacing dietary saturated fats with n-3 fatty acids, several positive effects on cardiovascular health can be observed. Moreover, increasing the intake of n-3 fatty acids can shift the balance of eicosanoid production in the vessel wall, favoring the synthesis of vasodilatory and anti-aggregatory metabolites. Furthermore, n-3 fatty acids have been found to reduce the production of pro-atherosclerotic growth factors by mononuclear cells. Studies have also suggested that n-3 fatty acids may offer particular protection against sudden cardiac death.

It is part of a group of conditions known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). While the exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Crohn's disease is its ability to affect various parts of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The inflammation associated with Crohn's disease can occur in patches, leading to affected areas being interspersed with healthy tissue. This \"skip\" pattern is a characteristic feature differentiating it from another IBD called ulcerative colitis, which affects only the colon and rectum without skip areas. Some common symptoms of Crohn's disease include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody), fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. In addition to the gastrointestinal symptoms, Crohn's disease can also have extra-intestinal manifestations, such as joint pain, skin rashes, eye inflammation, and liver problems, among others. The diagnosis of Crohn's disease involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and endoscopy. Treatment options for Crohn's disease aim to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and maintain remission. In severe cases, surgery may be required to repair or remove affected parts of the digestive tract. It's crucial for individuals with Crohn's disease to work closely with a healthcare provider who specializes in gastroenterology. While Crohn's disease is a chronic condition without a known cure, with proper management, many individuals can achieve long periods of remission and lead fulfilling lives. While there is no known cure for Crohn's disease, you may be able to avoid going on medication with potentially harmful side effects by following these steps to manage the disease naturally. Bowel disorders are an uncomfortable topic in today’s world, but many people suffer in silence. One of the worst forms of bowel disorders is Crohn’s disease. Crohn's disease affects up to 700,000 of Americans, according to the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. This disease is a chronic inflammation of the intestines that can lead to pain, intestinal blocks, cancer, and other serious diseases. Crohn’s disease is classified as an autoimmune disorder. According to Web MD, Crohn’s disease is chronic inflammation in the digestive tract ranging from the small intestine or colon. There are five types of Crohn’s disease, which include ileitis, ileocolitis, jejunoileitis, gastroduodenal Crohn’s disease, and granulomatous colitis. Ileitis: This form of Crohn’s disease has the same symptoms as Ileocolitis, but it affects the ileum. It may also have symptoms including fistulas or inflammatory abscesses. Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease: This version of the disease affects the first part of the small intestine- the stomach and duodenum. Bowel obstructions can occur with this form of the disease as well. Symptoms include inflammation, abdominal pain, cramps, fistulas, and diarrhea. Granulomatous colitis: This version of the disease affects the colon. Individuals with this form of Crohn's disease involves symptoms like rectal bleeding, joint pain, ulcers, fistulas, abscesses, and skin lesions. According to the Crohn's advocacy website, Crohn’s and Me, the issue of Crohn’s arises when cells in your GI tract start attacking healthy cells. The medical industry is unaware of the exact cause of Crohn’s disease. Smoking can also make any existing Crohn’s symptoms much worse. An overactive immune system is one likely cause for Crohn’s disease, although there is no scientific data proving that an overactive immune system will lead to Crohn's or what causes an overactive immune system in the first place. Main suspects are Omega-6 fats, grains, and gluten, processed foods, or dairy products (for lactose-intolerant individuals). Smoking: Smoking is a direct link to Crohn’s disease flare-ups. If you want to avoid the discomfort of Crohn’s disease, do not smoke. Because there is so little known about this disease, managing Crohn’s disease is a life-long process. Antibiotics: Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to reduce the bacteria levels in the intestine. Biologics: A biologic medication is the newest idea for Crohn’s disease. These non-steroid medications contain special antibodies that are designed to bind to specific substances, enzymes, and proteins that affect Crohn’s sufferers. Surgery: In some cases, surgery can help individuals with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease is something that requires management and notice every day. Exercise is important for Crohn’s sufferers because it can help reduce depressive symptoms, according to Web MD. Herbs: One herbal supplement has been proved to help individuals with Crohn’s disease. A 2001 study from Heidelberg University indicated that the herb boswellia was just as effective as mesalazine in the management of Crohn’s symptoms. There has been some research that suggests that diet may contribute to Crohn’s symptoms and flare-ups. Fiber is difficult to digest, which can worsen intestinal obstruction. The liquid intake for this diet is high to prevent intestinal blocks. According to US News, elemental or enteral diets may be effective in decreasing Crohn’s-induced inflammation and increasing remission. Usually, this method is used when patients have an intestinal block. While following a healthy diet is essential for managing Crohn’s symptoms, it is important not to block out entire food groups in the quest to reduce flare-ups. You should avoid a few substances if you suffer from Crohn’s disease. Stress can be a trigger for Crohn’s disease. Vitamin D: Many patients with Crohn’s disease are deficient in Vitamin D, sometimes from medications prescribed for the disease. Try taking probiotics, but discontinue their use if your symptoms get worse. Calcium: Crohn’s patients on medication are often at-risk for a calcium deficiency. Fish Oil: According to a 1996 study from the University of Bologna in Italy, fish oil supplements can help reduce Crohn’s flare-ups. Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune disease that is not fully understood by the medical industry. Crohn’s patients usually have to discover triggers and resolution methods on their own. There are some medical treatments available to help control Crohn’s symptoms. There is disagreement as to whether OFG represents an early form of Crohn disease or sarcoidosis, or whether it is a distinct, but similar clinical entity. Crohn disease can affect any part of gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus. When it involves the mouth alone, some authors refer to this as \"oral Crohn disease\", distinguishing it from OFG, and others suggest that OFG is the same condition as Crohn disease when it presents in the oral cavity. Treatment includes bowel rest, orogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and intravenous antibiotics. Complications may include short-gut syndrome, intestinal strictures, or developmental delay. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by inflammation and ulceration in various parts of the digestive system, commonly involving the small intestine and the colon. Crohn's disease is often a lifelong condition with periods of active symptoms followed by periods of remission. One true statement regarding Crohn's disease is that it is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), along with ulcerative colitis. However, it is important to note that while both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share similarities as chronic inflammatory conditions, they also have distinct differences in terms of the specific areas of the digestive tract they affect and the patterns of inflammation. Crohn's disease can involve any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus, and can involve all layers of the intestinal wall. Another true statement is that the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Furthermore, Crohn's disease can present with a wide range of symptoms, which can vary in severity and may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and rectal bleeding. Additionally, complications of Crohn's disease can arise, such as bowel obstructions, fistulas (abnormal connections between different parts of the intestine), abscesses, and nutritional deficiencies. To diagnose Crohn's disease, various tests may be conducted, including blood tests, stool tests, endoscopy, imaging studies (such as CT scans or MRIs), and sometimes biopsies of the affected area. Treatment for Crohn's disease aims to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and maintain long-term remission. In conclusion, Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract.

Binge drinking, or heavy episodic drinking, is drinking alcoholic beverages with an intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time, but definitions (see below) vary considerably. Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. Due to the long term effects of excessive alcohol use, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue. Binge drinking is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, and musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with 6% reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. Frequent binge drinking can lead to brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). Each binge drinking episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. A 2020 study found that even a single episode of binge drinking can lead to atrophy of the brain's corpus callosum, which damage was still detectable by an MRI scanner five weeks later. Definitions \n\nStolle, Sack and Thomasius define binge drinking as episodic excessive drinking. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, defines binge drinking as \"a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. One 2001 definition from the publication Psychology of Addictive Behavior states that five drinks for men and four drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion at least once in a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking. When BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health) conducted a study which gathered information of people over the age of 18, it defined binge drinkers as those who consumed six or more standard drinks on one occasion whether that be weekly or monthly. For example, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines the term \"binge drinking\" as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. In adults, binge drinking is more common in people who have never been married and score a grade B or less in education. Risk factors for binge drinking among adolescents include: low socioeconomic status, large amount of disposable (pocket) money, sensation and novelty seeking, low self-control, delinquency and having delinquent friends. Other risk factors include: using alcohol as a coping strategy for emotional problems (more common in adolescent girls), excessive drinking among peers, poor relationship with parents, excessive alcohol use by parents. Additionally the risk-taking behavior associated with adolescence promotes binge drinking. Health effects\n\nAcute intoxication, such as binge drinking and alcoholism, are known potent risk factors for suicide. Binge drinking is also associated with an increased risk of unplanned and unprotected sex, unplanned pregnancies, and an increased risk of HIV infection. Heavy drinkers cause approximately 183,000 rapes and sexual assaults, 197,000 robberies, 661,000 aggravated assaults, and 1.7 million simple assaults each year. Binge drinking has been associated with higher probability of divorce, spousal abuse, and poor job performance. Binge drinking can cause adverse effects on the body including effects on blood homeostasis and its circadian variation, cardiac rhythm, ischaemic heart disease, blood pressure, white blood cell activity, female reproductive hormone levels as well as adverse effects on the fetus. There is also evidence from animal studies that binge drinking causes brain damage. Binge drinking has been associated with lower abdominal pain in women. Alcohol affects brain development quite significantly especially during adolescence when the brain is still developing. Adolescence and young adulthood\n\nThe high levels of binge drinking among young people and the adverse consequences that include increased risk of alcoholism as an adult and liver disease make binge drinking a major public health issue. Heavy and regular binge drinking during adolescence is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism. Approximately 40% of alcoholics report heavy drinking during adolescence. Repeated episodes of excessive drinking, especially at an early age, are thought to cause a profound increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-related disorder (ICD-10, harmful use/dependence syndrome). Heavy drinking is also closely associated with depression. In a study conducted at Harvard University, it was found that about 32% of students surveyed were diagnosable for alcohol use  disorder and about 6% were diagnosed as alcohol dependent. Binge drinking is also becoming an increasing problem in Australian adolescents, the Australian School Students Alcohol and Drug survey conducted by the National Cancer Council discovered that around 33% of students between years 7 and 11 consumed alcohol in the week leading up to the survey, they also found that 10% of the students participated in binge drinking at a consumption level which is considered dangerous to adults. Other risk factors that influence the development of alcohol use disorder include social and genetic factors. However, it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both age at first drink and propensity for alcoholism. The main cause of death among adolescents as a result of binge drinking is road traffic accidents; a third of all fatal road traffic accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds are associated with drinking alcohol. Earlier sexual activity, increased changing of sexual partners, higher rate of unwanted pregnancy, higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and alcohol-related damage to the fetus during pregnancy is associated with binge drinking. Female binge drinkers are three times more likely to be victims of sexual assault; 50% of adolescent girls reporting sexual assault were under the influence of alcohol or another psychotropic substance at the time. Adolescents who regularly participated in binge drinking for several years show a smaller hippocampus brain region, in particular those who began drinking in early adolescence. Heavy binge drinking is associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits. Animal studies suggest that the neurodegenerative effects of heavy alcohol use during adolescence can be permanent. Several studies have been conducted to discover if there is a link between binge drinking in adolescent years and becoming a chronic alcohol consumer when they transition into adulthood. Binge drinking is a way for young adolescents to rely alcohol as a way to cope with certain stress or depression. Central nervous system\n\nHeavy binge drinkers tend to have delayed auditory and verbal memory and deficits in executive planning function and episodic memory, which are similar to deficits seen in Korsakoff's syndrome. Studies in adolescents have shown that regular binge drinking may cause long-lasting cognitive impairments, though the threshold needed to produce significant effects remains unclear. Cognitive impairment in adults is also unclear, as one study found no association between binge drinking and cognitive impairment. Binge drinking is believed to increase impulsivity due to altered functioning of prefrontal–subcortical and orbitofrontal circuits. Binge drinking and alcoholics who have undergone multiple detoxifications is associated with an inability to interpret facial expressions properly; this is believed to be due to kindling of the amygdala with resultant distortion of neurotransmission. Adolescents, females and young adults are most sensitive to the neuropsychological effects of binge drinking. Adolescence, in particular early adolescence, is a developmental stage that is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic and neurocognitive adverse effects of binge drinking due to it being a time of significant brain development. Binge drinking regimes are associated with causing an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory amino acids and changes in monoamines release in the central nervous system, which increases neurotoxicity and may result in cognitive impairments, psychological problems and in long-term heavy binge drinkers may cause irreversible brain damage in both adolescents and adults. Though heavy binge drinking adolescent humans show impaired brain activity during memory tests and underdeveloped brain structures compared to adolescents who did not binge-drink, they argue that these findings are similar to adults who did not have alcohol use disorder during adolescence. Binge drinking during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects as well as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Binge drinking three or more times during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. Sudden death\nBinge drinking is also associated with strokes and sudden death. The withdrawal phase after an episode of binge drinking is particularly associated with ischaemic stroke as well as subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage in younger men. In individuals with an underlying cardiac disorder a binge on alcohol increases the risk of silent myocardial ischaemia as well as angina. Binge drinking has negative effects on metabolism, lipid profile, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, blood pressure and vascular tone and is associated with embolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Binge-drinking by people otherwise considered to be light drinkers is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and mortality. Binge drinking increases cardiovascular toxicity due to its adverse effects on the electrical conduction system of the heart and the process of atherothrombosis. Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 80,000 deaths in the U.S. each year1 and $223.5 billion in economic costs in 2006.2 More than half of these deaths and three-quarters of the economic costs are due to binge drinking1 and 2 (≥4 drinks for women; ≥5 drinks for men, per occasion). Another common risk is a blackout (alcohol-related amnesia), which can cause shame, guilt, embarrassment, harm to personal relationships, injury or death, and is also associated with the loss of personal belongings. Pathophysiology\n\nBinge drinking has the propensity to result in brain damage faster as well as more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated alcohol free stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic heavy alcohol use; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to excitotoxicity. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas that are involved in learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy two-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals is believed to be the mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Blackouts, a form of amnesia that occurs in binge drinkers may be due to suppressed hippocampus function with rebound NMDA (glutamate) activity combined with excessive glucocorticoid release induced by the stress of repeated intoxication followed by acute withdrawal/abstinence is the proposed mechanism of neural kindling leading to neurotoxicity of structures involved in learning and memory within the brain of binge drinkers. Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including myelinization and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. An adolescent rat study found that a short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Behaviorally, frequent binge drinking is usually involved, but not everyone who engages in binge drinking develops an alcohol use disorder. For example, it has been found that using a narrow two week window for assessment of binge drinking habits leads to 30% of heavy regular binge drinkers wrongly being classed as not having an alcohol use disorder. Prevention\nBinge drinking is considered harmful, regardless of a person's age, and there have been calls for healthcare professionals to give increased attention to their patients’ drinking habits, especially binge drinking. There are also a number of individual counseling approaches, such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches, that have been shown to reduce drinking among heavy drinking college students. In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address binge drinking problems in patients. This campaign titled \"Don't Turn a Night Out Into a Nightmare\" was delivered to the public over many mass media platforms to show the harms and consequences of risky single occasion drinking (RSOD) as binge drinking is defined in Australia. Treatment\nDue to the risks especially in adolescents, of cognitive impairments and possible irreversible brain damage associated with binge drinking, urgent action has been recommended. There is some evidence that interventions by employers such as, health and lifestyle checks, psychosocial skills training and peer referral, can reduce the level of binge drinking. In the US brief motivational interventions have shown some benefit in reducing future binge drinking. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to admission to hospital, e.g. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing and educating the adolescent of possible negative short and long-term consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents. Increasing public information and awareness regarding the risks of binge drinking, conducting interviews in emergency departments of young people suspected of harmful drinking patterns and trying to persuade them to accept individual counseling in youth addiction counseling services are effective strategies for reducing the harm of binge drinking. Additionally, the provision of educational content about the risks of binge drinking and a risk assessment are beneficial during intervention with young binge drinkers and a referral in the case of an alcohol use disorder for specialised help. According to the NIAAA definition of \"heavy drinkers\", men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or four drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than seven standard drinks per week or three drinks per day. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either \"heavy drinkers\" or \"binge drinkers\" also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met this criteria. An inference drawn in this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases. Epidemiology\n\nBinge drinking is more common in men than it is in women. Racial differences exist among binge drinking with Hispanics followed by Caucasians having the highest level of binge drinking. Individuals of African descent have a lower level of binge drinking followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking may be due to the presence of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2, Chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol, which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing. Other factors that have been found to correlate with higher levels of binge drinking include low religiosity, marijuana use, living with roommates, and cigarette use. History\n\nSociety and culture\n\nBinge drinking costs the UK economy approximately £20 billion a year; 17 million working days are estimated to be lost due to hangovers and drink-related illness each year. Urgent action has been recommended to understand the binge drinking culture and its aetiology and pathogenesis and urgent action has been called for to educate people with regard to the dangers of binge drinking. Significant independent risk factors for driving after binge drinking included male gender (AOR=1.75); being aged 35–54 or ≥55 years compared to 18–34 years (AOR=1.58 and 2.37, respectively); and drinking in bars or clubs compared to drinking in the respondent's home (AOR=7.81). Because of these discrepancies, college-age women tend to experience the consequences of binge drinking before their male counterparts. With alcohol abuse remaining highly stigmatized—particularly in the case of pregnant women—some advocate for treatment programs to focus on a non-judgmental stance, on personal empowerment, and on offering contraceptives to women engaging in sex, in order to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

Binge drinking, or heavy episodic drinking, is drinking alcoholic beverages with an intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time, but definitions (see below) vary considerably. Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. Due to the long term effects of excessive alcohol use, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue. Binge drinking is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, and musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with 6% reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. Frequent binge drinking can lead to brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). Each binge drinking episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. A 2020 study found that even a single episode of binge drinking can lead to atrophy of the brain's corpus callosum, which damage was still detectable by an MRI scanner five weeks later. Definitions \n\nStolle, Sack and Thomasius define binge drinking as episodic excessive drinking. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, defines binge drinking as \"a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. One 2001 definition from the publication Psychology of Addictive Behavior states that five drinks for men and four drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion at least once in a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking.

For example, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines the term \"binge drinking\" as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. In adults, binge drinking is more common in people who have never been married and score a grade B or less in education. Risk factors for binge drinking among adolescents include: low socioeconomic status, large amount of disposable (pocket) money, sensation and novelty seeking, low self-control, delinquency and having delinquent friends. Other risk factors include: using alcohol as a coping strategy for emotional problems (more common in adolescent girls), excessive drinking among peers, poor relationship with parents, excessive alcohol use by parents.
