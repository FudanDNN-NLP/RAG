In this case, a p-value less than 0.01 suggests strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a linear correlation between height and weight in the sample of college students. This means that there is a statistical association between these variables, implying that as height increases, weight also tends to increase, or vice versa. It is important to note that this finding applies specifically to the sample of college students and may not necessarily generalize to the entire population. A smaller p-value in a t-test comparing the means of two samples indicates that there is stronger evidence to suggest that the means of the two populations are different.

The aims of the present study were to investigate olfactory sensitivity in ASC, and to test the association of sensitivity to autistic traits. Detection distance was independent of age and IQ for both groups, but showed a significant positive correlation with autistic traits in the ASC group (r =0.522). This is the first experimental demonstration, as far as the authors are aware, of superior olfactory perception in ASC and showing that greater olfactory sensitivity is correlated with a higher number of autistic traits. Results are discussed in terms of possible underlying neurophysiology. The latter example may reflect tactile hyper-sensitivity or simply resistance to change. In clinical studies, higher sensory reactivity and sensitivity scores have been shown in children with ASC compared to controls using the Dunn Sensory Profile  and in adults with ASC using the Sensory Perception Quotient . Taken together, all these examples suggest that people with ASC sense the world in a different way compared with others. For example, Blakemore et al. An experimental study of visual acuity reported by our lab  found that people with ASC were better than controls at perceiving the location of the gap in targets consisting of letter C’s presented on a computer screen, and has been replicated by a study from an independent lab . While these studies reported no differences in olfactory detection sensitivity or impaired detection threshold for the ASC groups compared to controls, the main focus of two of them was on olfactory discrimination rather than detection sensitivity [22, 24]. Tasks involving the identification of odour choices involve different cognitive and neural processes compared to tasks examining ‘low-level’ olfactory detection thresholds registering presence or absence of an odour [26–28]. Three of the studies [23–25] involved a design with two or three different response options on each trial that the participants had to compare and remember. We also investigated the relationship between olfactory hypersensitivity and degree of autistic traits in those with ASC, using scores from the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Moreover, Hilton et al. As such, we predicted a correlation between olfactory sensitivity and AQ in the ASC group. In the tactile domain there is evidence that hyporesponsiveness shows a correlation with clinical symptoms that is not evident for tactile hyperresponsiveness . A review of the sensory literature reported that hyporesponsivity might actually be more evident in ASC . It may also be the case that the behaviours of hyporesponsiveness may simply overlap with some of the social symptoms in ASC, such as a lack of response to being called by name. Participants with ASC completed the AQ, a 50-item self-report questionnaire with a forced choice format asking about behaviours associated with autism. An example question is ’I tend to have very strong interests which I get upset about if I can’t pursue’, which would score 1 if a participant chose either slightly agree or definitely agree. The AST was used because it is a simple, rapid, and reliable evaluation of olfaction  and has been shown to have good test-retest reliability . We followed the procedures as previously developed [43, 44], although in the present study we included a further three trials for each participant to get a better estimate of the parameter without overly increasing the time. We also included a greater range of detection distances because it was unknown beforehand what the mean detection distances would be for people with ASC, and our prediction was for larger mean detection distances for this group. Care was taken so the hand of the experimenter never came into contact with the participant, to ensure the participant was unaware about the location of the stimulus. The dependent measure was the mean distance (cm) from the nose measured when participants detected the smell. The mean distance was calculated by averaging the distances from the nose across all five trials for each participant. On one of the trials for each participant the experimenter delayed raising the stimulus for 5 seconds. None of the participants reported detecting a smell during the ‘catch period’ of these ‘placebo’ trials, and the distance of eventual detection on these placebo trials did not differ significantly from the other trials (all P >0.05). A repeated-measures ANOVA was carried out on the mean olfactory detection distances to test the main hypothesis for differences in olfactory sensitivity, with Trial (1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4 vs. 5) as the within-subjects factor and Group (ASC vs. controls) as the between-subjects factor. As the sample in this study was relatively small, the data were re-analysed using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure, to see if the effect was still present using a more conservative procedure. The ANOVA makes parametric assumptions about how the difference between the ASC and control groups would vary if this study were repeated. Specifically, it assumes that across many replications, the observed differences between two groups who are the same overall would follow a normal distribution. In contrast, bootstrapping procedures make no assumptions about how a statistic varies [45, 46]. Instead, an empirical estimate is obtained by repeatedly taking samples from the data that have been collected and seeing how the statistic of interest varies across these samples. In this case, the statistic of interest was the overall mean difference between the ASC and control groups’ scores, and the original pools of 17 ASC scores and 17 control scores were repeatedly sampled with replacement. This was repeated 10,000 times and on each occasion the mean difference between the ASC sample and the control sample was noted, providing many estimates of the group differences that might be seen in replications of this experiment. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that both groups provided distributions of mean detection distance scores that were not significantly different from normal. Importantly, there was a significant main effect of Group, F(1,32) =10.1, P <0.01, η2p =0.24, with the ASC group (mean =24.1 cm, SD =11.5, 95% CI =18.2 to 29.9) detecting the odour at a significantly further distance compared to the control group (mean =14.4 cm, SD =5.9, 95% CI =11.3 to 17.4; see Figure 1). Boxplot showing the mean distance (cm) from the nose at which the control and ASC groups were able to detect the odour in the Alcohol Sniff Test. Larger values reflect greater perceptual sensitivity and error bars represent standard error values. The bootstrap analysis confirmed that the mean advantage in detection distance for the ASC group was 9.70 cm and provided a 95% CI for this statistic of 2.90 to 15.93. This confidence interval was calculated using the simple percentile method, meaning the 10,000 recorded differences between ASC samples and control samples were arranged from the lowest to the highest and the cut-offs for the bottom 2.5% and top 2.5% of scores identified. In fact, of the 10,000 ‘replications’ in this analysis, in only 32 (0.32%) did the ASC group show no advantage over the control group, providing an empirical two-tailed estimate of P =0.0032 for the ASC group’s superior performance on this task. Finally, correlation analyses revealed that mean odour detection distance was independent of IQ when the groups were combined (r =0.25, P >0.05) and when considered separately (ASC, r =0.32, P >0.05; controls, r =0.14, P >0.05). Similarly, there was no significant correlation between detection distance and age in either the ASC (r = -0.29, P >0.05) or control (r = -0.17, P >0.05) groups. However, there was a significant positive correlation in the ASC group between odour detection distance and AQ scores (r =0.52, P <0.05; Figure 2). Scatter plot showing the positive correlation between mean distance of odour detection thresholds (cm) and Autism-Spectrum Quotient scores (0 to 50) for the ASC group. The mean score by the control group is in line with previous results using the AST in samples of typical adults [43, 47] and the test showed a large effect size for the difference between the groups (Cohen’s d =1.06). The mean distance of detection in those with ASC was also positively correlated with AQ scores, showing that greater olfactory sensitivity was associated with a higher number of autistic traits. These findings extend previous experimental results of enhanced sensitivity across various modalities in people with ASC [14–20] to also include the olfactory domain. As such, all these earlier studies used fundamentally different tasks than the present study. Differences in the detection methods and samples used between those studies and the present research makes it hard to directly compare results and may help explain inconsistent results in the literature. Moreover, no such relationship was seen for either age or level of cognitive functioning. The authors utilised data from their own previous research on olfaction processing which reported no group differences in olfactory detection threshold , and further reported no relationship was evident between olfactory detection thresholds and autism severity . While research has shown that olfactory sensitivity is quite common and is evident in over half of people with ASC , it also indicates that differences in olfactory functioning are not apparent in all people with ASC. Research has found that the degree of pleasantness rated for different odours in ASC was related to how easily they identified odours, with more pleasantly-rated odours being easier to identify, and more unpleasant odours identified with greater difficulty . Therefore, it is possible the pleasantness level of odours for people with ASC could also affect their detection threshold for that odour. The participants in the present study did not rate the pleasantness of the odour stimuli used in the task, so its role in the results cannot be determined. However, the present findings within olfaction do not support the idea that differences in habituation were involved in the results, as there was no evidence for differences in habituation or learning effects across the trials for those with ASC. This cognitive style may be beneficial for some tasks, such as visual search paradigms. However, it may impair performance on other tasks, like those involving mentalizing, especially when there are no details with which to draw inferences. Visual search benefits from attention to detail because there are real details to use in order to verify the facts. Mentalizing does not benefit from attention to detail because mental states cannot be directly observed and can only be inferred from contextual cues (e.g. This means there are few, if any, facts that can be verified during mentalizing. Another possibility is that over-selective or over-focused attention could lead to sensory over-reactivity, with enhanced processing of sensory stimuli occurring within an amplified focus of attention towards sensory information [39, 58]. This suggests that one mechanism (e.g. These findings are consistent with the idea of one common mechanism contributing to differences in sensory sensitivity across all modalities, as it is unlikely that separate mechanisms within each of the major sensory systems would independently show the same type of dysfunction. However, further research replicating these findings using psychophysiological measures would help validate this idea. It could be argued that, rather than reflecting differences in olfactory sensitivity between the ASC and control groups, the results here are an experimental artefact. Given the design of the AST, it is possible the group difference in olfactory sensitivity may have emerged from a response bias by the ASC group. However, to counter such a claim we included a catch (‘placebo’) trial for every participant in the study in order to test for response biases, where the raising of the stimulus towards the nose was delayed by 5 seconds. Not once did any participant with ASC respond during this catch period, suggesting response biases where people with ASC may have been simply guessing about the presence of the stimulus were not present. In addition, the eventual detection distances for the catch trials did not differ from other trials where no catch period was present. These findings with the catch trials suggest no response bias existed for those with ASC, where they may have responded in expectation of the odour stimulus. Moreover, to reduce the chance of a type I error from the relatively small number of participants (n = 17 for each group) and trials, the data were further analysed using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure. The bootstrapping technique is appropriate for datasets with fewer participants and trials, which involved looking at the mean difference between groups in 10,000 samples of the data. Although this number is in line with many previously published studies testing sensory sensitivity in ASC, and although we conducted an additional analysis to compensate for the small sample, further research should include larger samples. The two groups did differ between each other in terms of mean age, although this was not considered a problem since our prediction was for superior olfaction in the ASC group and olfactory sensitivity declines with age [84, 85]. CA designed the study, carried out the statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript. SBC provided input on the conception and design of the study, behavioural measure selection and scoring, and helped revise the manuscript. For example, a sample of teenagers might be divided into male and female on the one hand, and those that are and are not currently studying for a statistics exam on the other. We hypothesize, for example, that the proportion of studying individuals is higher among the women than among the men, and we want to test whether any difference of proportions that we observe is significant. The data might look like this: The question we ask about these data is: knowing that 10 of these 24 teenagers are studying, and that 12 of the 24 are female, and assuming \n\n the estimated bias, and the SD of the differences measures the random fluctuations around this mean. If the mean value of the difference differs significantly from 0 on the basis of a 1-sample t-test, this indicates the presence of fixed bias. If there is a consistent bias, it can be adjusted for by subtracting the mean difference from the new method. It is common to compute 95% limits of agreement for each comparison (average difference ± 1.96 standard deviation of the difference), which tells us how far apart measurements by two methods were more likely to be for most individuals.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

This can be done by Bland and Altman's approximate method or by more precise methods. Bland–Altman plots were also used to investigate any possible relationship of the discrepancies between the measurements and the true value (i.e., proportional bias).

The aims of the present study were to investigate olfactory sensitivity in ASC, and to test the association of sensitivity to autistic traits. Detection distance was independent of age and IQ for both groups, but showed a significant positive correlation with autistic traits in the ASC group (r =0.522). This is the first experimental demonstration, as far as the authors are aware, of superior olfactory perception in ASC and showing that greater olfactory sensitivity is correlated with a higher number of autistic traits. Results are discussed in terms of possible underlying neurophysiology. The latter example may reflect tactile hyper-sensitivity or simply resistance to change. In clinical studies, higher sensory reactivity and sensitivity scores have been shown in children with ASC compared to controls using the Dunn Sensory Profile  and in adults with ASC using the Sensory Perception Quotient . Taken together, all these examples suggest that people with ASC sense the world in a different way compared with others. For example, Blakemore et al. An experimental study of visual acuity reported by our lab  found that people with ASC were better than controls at perceiving the location of the gap in targets consisting of letter C’s presented on a computer screen, and has been replicated by a study from an independent lab . While these studies reported no differences in olfactory detection sensitivity or impaired detection threshold for the ASC groups compared to controls, the main focus of two of them was on olfactory discrimination rather than detection sensitivity [22, 24]. Tasks involving the identification of odour choices involve different cognitive and neural processes compared to tasks examining ‘low-level’ olfactory detection thresholds registering presence or absence of an odour [26–28]. Three of the studies [23–25] involved a design with two or three different response options on each trial that the participants had to compare and remember. We also investigated the relationship between olfactory hypersensitivity and degree of autistic traits in those with ASC, using scores from the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Moreover, Hilton et al. As such, we predicted a correlation between olfactory sensitivity and AQ in the ASC group. In the tactile domain there is evidence that hyporesponsiveness shows a correlation with clinical symptoms that is not evident for tactile hyperresponsiveness . A review of the sensory literature reported that hyporesponsivity might actually be more evident in ASC . It may also be the case that the behaviours of hyporesponsiveness may simply overlap with some of the social symptoms in ASC, such as a lack of response to being called by name. Participants with ASC completed the AQ, a 50-item self-report questionnaire with a forced choice format asking about behaviours associated with autism. An example question is ’I tend to have very strong interests which I get upset about if I can’t pursue’, which would score 1 if a participant chose either slightly agree or definitely agree. The AST was used because it is a simple, rapid, and reliable evaluation of olfaction  and has been shown to have good test-retest reliability . We followed the procedures as previously developed [43, 44], although in the present study we included a further three trials for each participant to get a better estimate of the parameter without overly increasing the time. We also included a greater range of detection distances because it was unknown beforehand what the mean detection distances would be for people with ASC, and our prediction was for larger mean detection distances for this group. Care was taken so the hand of the experimenter never came into contact with the participant, to ensure the participant was unaware about the location of the stimulus. The dependent measure was the mean distance (cm) from the nose measured when participants detected the smell. The mean distance was calculated by averaging the distances from the nose across all five trials for each participant. On one of the trials for each participant the experimenter delayed raising the stimulus for 5 seconds. None of the participants reported detecting a smell during the ‘catch period’ of these ‘placebo’ trials, and the distance of eventual detection on these placebo trials did not differ significantly from the other trials (all P >0.05). A repeated-measures ANOVA was carried out on the mean olfactory detection distances to test the main hypothesis for differences in olfactory sensitivity, with Trial (1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4 vs. 5) as the within-subjects factor and Group (ASC vs. controls) as the between-subjects factor. As the sample in this study was relatively small, the data were re-analysed using a non-parametric bootstrapping procedure, to see if the effect was still present using a more conservative procedure. The ANOVA makes parametric assumptions about how the difference between the ASC and control groups would vary if this study were repeated. Specifically, it assumes that across many replications, the observed differences between two groups who are the same overall would follow a normal distribution. In contrast, bootstrapping procedures make no assumptions about how a statistic varies [45, 46]. Instead, an empirical estimate is obtained by repeatedly taking samples from the data that have been collected and seeing how the statistic of interest varies across these samples. In this case, the statistic of interest was the overall mean difference between the ASC and control groups’ scores, and the original pools of 17 ASC scores and 17 control scores were repeatedly sampled with replacement. This was repeated 10,000 times and on each occasion the mean difference between the ASC sample and the control sample was noted, providing many estimates of the group differences that might be seen in replications of this experiment. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that both groups provided distributions of mean detection distance scores that were not significantly different from normal. Importantly, there was a significant main effect of Group, F(1,32) =10.1, P <0.01, η2p =0.24, with the ASC group (mean =24.1 cm, SD =11.5, 95% CI =18.2 to 29.9) detecting the odour at a significantly further distance compared to the control group (mean =14.4 cm, SD =5.9, 95% CI =11.3 to 17.4; see Figure 1). Boxplot showing the mean distance (cm) from the nose at which the control and ASC groups were able to detect the odour in the Alcohol Sniff Test. Larger values reflect greater perceptual sensitivity and error bars represent standard error values. The bootstrap analysis confirmed that the mean advantage in detection distance for the ASC group was 9.70 cm and provided a 95% CI for this statistic of 2.90 to 15.93. This confidence interval was calculated using the simple percentile method, meaning the 10,000 recorded differences between ASC samples and control samples were arranged from the lowest to the highest and the cut-offs for the bottom 2.5% and top 2.5% of scores identified. In fact, of the 10,000 ‘replications’ in this analysis, in only 32 (0.32%) did the ASC group show no advantage over the control group, providing an empirical two-tailed estimate of P =0.0032 for the ASC group’s superior performance on this task. Finally, correlation analyses revealed that mean odour detection distance was independent of IQ when the groups were combined (r =0.25, P >0.05) and when considered separately (ASC, r =0.32, P >0.05; controls, r =0.14, P >0.05). Similarly, there was no significant correlation between detection distance and age in either the ASC (r = -0.29, P >0.05) or control (r = -0.17, P >0.05) groups. However, there was a significant positive correlation in the ASC group between odour detection distance and AQ scores (r =0.52, P <0.05; Figure 2). Scatter plot showing the positive correlation between mean distance of odour detection thresholds (cm) and Autism-Spectrum Quotient scores (0 to 50) for the ASC group. The mean score by the control group is in line with previous results using the AST in samples of typical adults [43, 47] and the test showed a large effect size for the difference between the groups (Cohen’s d =1.06). The mean distance of detection in those with ASC was also positively correlated with AQ scores, showing that greater olfactory sensitivity was associated with a higher number of autistic traits. These findings extend previous experimental results of enhanced sensitivity across various modalities in people with ASC [14–20] to also include the olfactory domain. As such, all these earlier studies used fundamentally different tasks than the present study. Differences in the detection methods and samples used between those studies and the present research makes it hard to directly compare results and may help explain inconsistent results in the literature. Moreover, no such relationship was seen for either age or level of cognitive functioning. The authors utilised data from their own previous research on olfaction processing which reported no group differences in olfactory detection threshold , and further reported no relationship was evident between olfactory detection thresholds and autism severity . While research has shown that olfactory sensitivity is quite common and is evident in over half of people with ASC , it also indicates that differences in olfactory functioning are not apparent in all people with ASC. Research has found that the degree of pleasantness rated for different odours in ASC was related to how easily they identified odours, with more pleasantly-rated odours being easier to identify, and more unpleasant odours identified with greater difficulty . Therefore, it is possible the pleasantness level of odours for people with ASC could also affect their detection threshold for that odour. The participants in the present study did not rate the pleasantness of the odour stimuli used in the task, so its role in the results cannot be determined. However, the present findings within olfaction do not support the idea that differences in habituation were involved in the results, as there was no evidence for differences in habituation or learning effects across the trials for those with ASC. This cognitive style may be beneficial for some tasks, such as visual search paradigms. However, it may impair performance on other tasks, like those involving mentalizing, especially when there are no details with which to draw inferences. Visual search benefits from attention to detail because there are real details to use in order to verify the facts. Mentalizing does not benefit from attention to detail because mental states cannot be directly observed and can only be inferred from contextual cues (e.g. This means there are few, if any, facts that can be verified during mentalizing. Another possibility is that over-selective or over-focused attention could lead to sensory over-reactivity, with enhanced processing of sensory stimuli occurring within an amplified focus of attention towards sensory information [39, 58]. This suggests that one mechanism (e.g. These findings are consistent with the idea of one common mechanism contributing to differences in sensory sensitivity across all modalities, as it is unlikely that separate mechanisms within each of the major sensory systems would independently show the same type of dysfunction. However, further research replicating these findings using psychophysiological measures would help validate this idea.

METHODS: An ecologic study using panel data of 920 505 kindergarten students with 11 694 school-year observations examined the effect of the IMBP on dmft scores from 1998 to 2009. Ordinary least squares regression with fixed effects determined the association between IMBP visits per child 0 to 4 years of age per county and mean dmft scores per kindergarten student per school, controlling for school-level poverty and ethnicity, county-level Medicaid enrollment, and supply of dentists and physicians. RESULTS: Mean dmft per kindergarten student per school increased from 1.53 in 1998 to 1.84 in 2004, then decreased to 1.59 in 2009. A 1-unit increase in IMBP visits per county was associated with a 0.248 (95% confidence interval, −0.40 to −0.10) decrease in dmft per kindergarten student per school. For schools with more students at high risk for dental disease, a 1-unit increase in IMBP visits was associated with a 0.320 (95% confidence interval, −0.55 to −0.09) decrease in dmft. Individual-level studies demonstrate that the IMBP is effective in increasing access to preventive dental care and improving oral health outcomes for those who receive services.14–16 The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the IMBP, a statewide program targeting young children enrolled in Medicaid who use primary care medical services, on trends in dental caries among 5-year-old children. This ecologic study used panel data and regression methods to examine the association between IMBP services provided in each county and caries experience of kindergarten children in North Carolina for academic years 1998–1999 to 2009–2010, by using schools as the unit of analysis. Evaluation of examiner performance has demonstrated reliability and validity for these estimates,18 and data have been used in a number of research studies.19–21 For this study, the unit of analysis was the school year, and caries experience was measured as the school-level average number of dmft per screened kindergarten student. We constructed our exposure variable to be a county-level measure of the mean number of IMBP visits per child 0 to 4 years of age per year. Because IMBP services are provided to children aged 0 to 3½ years and outcomes are assessed in children at 5 years of age, this variable was lagged 3 years. Preliminary bivariate analyses examining associations between each predictor variable and school-level average dmft were conducted using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with t tests, without adjustment for other variables. We used OLS regression models, adjusting for the primary explanatory variable and all control variables, to estimate the effect of the IMBP on the school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student.29 The outcome of interest was weighted by the number of students in the school who were screened. Because we had repeat observations of schools over time, school-level fixed effects adjusted for school characteristics that were constant over time and year fixed effects adjusted for statewide time-varying trends. To account for potential correlation between schools’ variance estimates over time, we used cluster-robust SEs.30 Wald tests were used to examine associations between explanatory variables and the outcome variable. OLS regression models were estimated for the full sample and for a subgroup of schools that had ≥80% of their students participating in the NSLP at any point during the study period. We ran simulations by using coefficients from the regression models to calculate the predicted school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student in 2009 under the following 3 conditions: no IMBP, the observed number of IMBP visits, and more IMBP visits. To understand how increasing the number of IMBP visits might reduce dental caries in young children, we predicted mean dmft in 2009 based on increases in the mean number of IMBP visits per county over the base rate of 2823 visits (0.18 visits per 0- to 4-year-old child per county) by 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 visits, representing, respectively, an average number of visits per county for the child population 0 to 4 years of age of 0.22, 0.26, 0.31, and 0.45. All analyses and statistical tests were performed in Stata/IC 12 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) at a .05 significance level. The surveillance database included 12 256 school-year observations (1385 unique schools) and 1 031 208 kindergarten students (mean per year = 93 922), of whom 965 867 (93.6%; mean per year = 87 956) were screened. We excluded schools missing information about NSLP participation (n = 12), with 5 or fewer kindergarten students screened (n = 3), missing information about Hispanic ethnicity (n = 9), and with surveillance data for 1 year only (n = 41). The analytical sample included 11 694 school-year observations (1294 unique schools) and 1 011 263 students (mean per year = 92 163), of whom 946 911 (93.6%; mean per year = 86 291) were screened. Schools were included in the analysis for an average of 9.89 years. The subgroup analysis of schools that ever had 80% or more of their students participating in the NSLP had 4236 school year-observations for 448 schools, included for an average of 10 years. Mean dmft per kindergarten student per school increased from 1.53 (SD = 0.69) in 1998 to 1.84 (SD = 0.75) in 2004, then decreased to 1.59 (SD = 0.77) in 2009. Table 2 displays the adjusted coefficients from the OLS regression models examining the association of each variable with the school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student for the full sample and the subsample of high-risk schools. In the full sample, we observed a statistically significant negative association between IMBP visits and the school-level average number of dmft per student. An increase in the average number of IMBP visits per child aged 0 to 4 years per county by 1 unit was associated with a 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.40 to −0.09) decrease in the annual school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student. Among these schools, the magnitude of the association between IMBP visits and dmft was greater than for all schools. In the full sample of schools, the predicted mean dmft in 2009 was greatest assuming no IMBP implementation (1.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.50). Increasing the school-level average number of IMBP visits per county by 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 visits led to corresponding predicted reductions in school-level average number dmft per kindergarten student of 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively, compared with actual 2009 values. Schools that had 80% or more students participating in the NSLP had a higher school-level average dmft score than the full sample of schools (Table 3). Increasing the mean number of IMBP visits per county led to corresponding predicted reductions in mean dmft per kindergarten student of 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.12. We observed a positive association between the proportion of students in a school participating in the NSLP and the mean number of dmft per kindergarten student per school. The larger effect of IMBP services in high-risk schools suggests that on average, children from low-income families are benefiting more from the IMBP than those from higher-income families. This strategy in which students who attend high-risk schools are targeted through their primary care medical offices before attending school should help reduce oral health disparities. We also controlled for time-invariant unobserved differences in schools through the use of school fixed effects and varying annual trends with year fixed effects. The total population of kindergarten students includes both children who are eligible for IMBP services and those who are not, and we do not know who received services. Exposures might have been misclassified by applying county-level mean IMBP participation rates to all schools in that county. The predictions of dmft scores with different levels of preventive dental services must be interpreted with caution.

The surveillance database included 12 256 school-year observations (1385 unique schools) and 1 031 208 kindergarten students (mean per year = 93 922), of whom 965 867 (93.6%; mean per year = 87 956) were screened. We excluded schools missing information about NSLP participation (n = 12), with 5 or fewer kindergarten students screened (n = 3), missing information about Hispanic ethnicity (n = 9), and with surveillance data for 1 year only (n = 41). The analytical sample included 11 694 school-year observations (1294 unique schools) and 1 011 263 students (mean per year = 92 163), of whom 946 911 (93.6%; mean per year = 86 291) were screened. Schools were included in the analysis for an average of 9.89 years. The subgroup analysis of schools that ever had 80% or more of their students participating in the NSLP had 4236 school year-observations for 448 schools, included for an average of 10 years. Mean dmft per kindergarten student per school increased from 1.53 (SD = 0.69) in 1998 to 1.84 (SD = 0.75) in 2004, then decreased to 1.59 (SD = 0.77) in 2009. Table 2 displays the adjusted coefficients from the OLS regression models examining the association of each variable with the school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student for the full sample and the subsample of high-risk schools. In the full sample, we observed a statistically significant negative association between IMBP visits and the school-level average number of dmft per student. An increase in the average number of IMBP visits per child aged 0 to 4 years per county by 1 unit was associated with a 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.40 to −0.09) decrease in the annual school-level average number of dmft per kindergarten student. Among these schools, the magnitude of the association between IMBP visits and dmft was greater than for all schools. In the full sample of schools, the predicted mean dmft in 2009 was greatest assuming no IMBP implementation (1.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.50). Increasing the school-level average number of IMBP visits per county by 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 visits led to corresponding predicted reductions in school-level average number dmft per kindergarten student of 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively, compared with actual 2009 values. Schools that had 80% or more students participating in the NSLP had a higher school-level average dmft score than the full sample of schools (Table 3). Increasing the mean number of IMBP visits per county led to corresponding predicted reductions in mean dmft per kindergarten student of 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.12. We observed a positive association between the proportion of students in a school participating in the NSLP and the mean number of dmft per kindergarten student per school. The larger effect of IMBP services in high-risk schools suggests that on average, children from low-income families are benefiting more from the IMBP than those from higher-income families. This strategy in which students who attend high-risk schools are targeted through their primary care medical offices before attending school should help reduce oral health disparities. We also controlled for time-invariant unobserved differences in schools through the use of school fixed effects and varying annual trends with year fixed effects. The total population of kindergarten students includes both children who are eligible for IMBP services and those who are not, and we do not know who received services. Exposures might have been misclassified by applying county-level mean IMBP participation rates to all schools in that county. The predictions of dmft scores with different levels of preventive dental services must be interpreted with caution. Dr Achembong designed the study and drafted the initial manuscript; Dr Kranz did the statistical analysis, assisted with result interpretation, and critically revised the initial manuscript; Dr Rozier conceptualized and designed the study, supervised the study conduct, assisted with data analysis, and critically revised the initial manuscript; and all authors approved the final manuscript as submitted. For example, a sample of teenagers might be divided into male and female on the one hand, and those that are and are not currently studying for a statistics exam on the other.\n\n"

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a team led by Andrea King, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, analyzed the subjective response of 104 young adult heavy social drinkers to alcohol and tracked their long-term drinking habits. They found that heavy social drinkers who report greater stimulation and reward from alcohol are more likely to develop alcohol use disorder over time, which they report May 15 in the journal Biological Psychiatry. Their findings run counter to existing hypotheses that innate tolerance to alcohol drives alcoholism. Participants engaged in three sessions, in which they were given a placebo drink with only the smell of alcohol, a low dose of alcohol or a high dose. The initial assessment when the participants were in their 20s revealed that the heavy drinkers showed a strongly positive preference to alcohol, reporting greater stimulating effects, ‘liking’, and ‘wanting more’, with lower sedative and cortisol effects. Participants were then assessed in regular follow-ups to track their drinking behaviors and symptoms of addiction over time. (Light drinkers formed one low-risk drinking group over time with no addiction symptoms so they were not further examined.) Searching for how those initially measured alcohol responses might predict which group the participants fell into, King and her team found that those in the high alcohol addiction symptom group reported far higher stimulation and pleasure from alcohol effects than members of the low or intermediate groups. Tolerance to alcohol’s fatiguing effects was less predictive of the future course of addiction. King and her colleagues are now engaged in pilot work to see if early intervention in drinkers with a positive response to alcohol is effective. From this perspective, it is inferred that caffeinated alcoholic drinks cause one to act in ways that would be less likely if one were drinking non-caffeinated alcoholic drinks. In the sample tested, 79% of participants demonstrated engaging in characterized drunkorexia behavior.

For example, under normal road-weather conditions (no precipitation and dry pavements), only 73% of drivers complied with the existing fixed speed limit of 110 km/h. This indicates that the current speed limit is not effective in ensuring driver compliance under normal conditions. In the presence of slight snow and ice warning pavement conditions, the reliability of the current speed limit is substantially reduced. This means that the speed limit may not be suitable for these adverse road-weather conditions, increasing the likelihood of accidents. These WRVSLs are based on the probability of a speed being both likely complied with by drivers and adequate to avoid rear-end collisions. The study suggests a range of reliability-based WRVSLs from 80 to 110 km/h for rural highways in extremely cold regions.

        "context": "A weather-responsive variable speed limit (WRVSL) system improves the safety of rural highways by adapting speed limits based on the current weather conditions. For example, under normal road-weather conditions (no precipitation and dry pavements), only 73% of drivers complied with the existing fixed speed limit of 110 km/h. This indicates that the current speed limit is not effective in ensuring driver compliance under normal conditions. In the presence of slight snow and ice warning pavement conditions, the reliability of the current speed limit is substantially reduced. This means that the speed limit may not be suitable for these adverse road-weather conditions, increasing the likelihood of accidents. These WRVSLs are based on the probability of a speed being both likely complied with by drivers and adequate to avoid rear-end collisions. The study suggests a range of reliability-based WRVSLs from 80 to 110 km/h for rural highways in extremely cold regions.

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one. A simple example of a binomial distribution is the set of various possible outcomes, and their probabilities, for the number of heads observed when a coin is flipped ten times. The relationship between the binomial distribution and the Bernoulli distribution is that the binomial distribution can be seen as an extension of the Bernoulli distribution. On the other hand, the binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent yes/no experiments. In fact, when we have only one experiment (n = 1), the binomial distribution reduces to a Bernoulli distribution. In a binomial distribution, we have two parameters: n and p. The parameter n represents the number of experiments or trials, while p represents the probability of success in each individual experiment. The binomial distribution is widely used in statistics for modeling situations involving multiple independent yes/no experiments, such as counting successes in medical trials or predicting outcomes based on binary data. Overall, while both distributions are related and share similarities, they differ in terms of their parameters and applicability to different scenarios. The binomial distribution extends from the Bernoulli distribution by considering multiple independent experiments instead of just one. In other words, a binomial proportion confidence interval is an interval estimate of a success probability p when only the number of experiments n and the number of successes nS are known. There are several formulas for a binomial confidence interval, but all of them rely on the assumption of a binomial distribution. In general, a binomial distribution applies when an experiment is repeated a fixed number of times, each trial of the experiment has two possible outcomes (success and failure), the probability of success is the same for each trial, and the trials are statistically independent.
