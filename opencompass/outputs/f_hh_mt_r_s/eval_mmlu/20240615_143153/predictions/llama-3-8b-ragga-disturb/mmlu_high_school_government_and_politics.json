It seeks to promote the notion of self-advocacy among individuals with disabilities and discusses possible applications to policy and intervention. In his book, Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism, Paul Collins sums up the philosophy of the neurodiversity movement and related social model of disability: “Think of it: a disability is usually defined in terms of what is missing…but autism…is as much about what is abundant as what is missing, an over-expression of the very traits that make our species unique” (2005). As a fairly new but strongly supported affiliation, neurodiversity is quickly gaining command in the world of disability. Kristin Bumiller (2008) describes this philosophy in her article by saying neurodiversity “has renewed interest in the question of how to promote diversity in all its manifestations and to further a more inclusive society,” identifying its righteous nature as parallel to that of historical and ongoing civil rights and gay liberation movements. In her article, “From Cure to Community: Transforming Notions of Autism,” Nancy Bagatell (2010) describes a fundamental component of neurodiversity called self-advocacy that encourages people with autism to voice their opinions, make their own decisions, fight for policy change, and essentially take control of their lives. In 1993, Joseph Shapiro qualified the self-advocacy movement as “the parallel cry for self-determination by another group of disabled people rebelling against being long underestimated, deprived of choices, treated as eternal children, and thought to lead lesser lives.” People First, the oldest self-advocacy group, was established in 1974 and voiced the needs of people with autism and other developmental disabilities. Both models promote the idea of “equality without sameness” and criticize a community that is unreceptive and, in fact, disapproving and unaccepting of behavioral diversity. The National Council on Disability, established in 1978 as an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, is a federal advisory board designed to represent the disabled population and ensure equal access to opportunities. Under an authorizing mandate, the team of fifteen Senate-confirmed presidential appointees advises the president, Congress, the secretary of education, and other federal groups in regards to “policies, programs, practices, and procedures” in the best interest of the affected population as well as promotes means through which the disabled can achieve maximum independence and full inclusion in society (“NCD”). Common threads of controversy include legislation related to school reform efforts, health care access, and fair employment opportunities. The statutory mandate states that the council will consist of “individuals with disabilities, parents or guardians of individuals with disabilities, or other individuals who have substantial knowledge of experience relating to disability policy or programs” (“NCD”). This particular component of the policy-making process is very important to the neurodiversity movement because it promotes self-advocacy and serves as a medium through which disabled populations can voice their needs and opinions about legislation. The National Council on Disability drafted the first version of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1988. Bush and implemented in 1990, this pivotal piece of legislation blazed a trail for future policy to protect the rights of disabled populations. In 2008, President George W. Bush signed the ADA Amendments Act which aims to give broader protections for the disabled and specifically notes what constitutes a “major life activity” in the original legislation. Today, the National Council on Disability continues to play an influential role in advising our nation’s government authority. Implementing disability policies concerning education, transportation, livable communities, foster youth, and crime victims (Young, 2010) the council shapes policy not only based on their own knowledge and research but also in response to the thousands of e-mails and letters they receive every year from individuals all over the United States (“NCD”). Aside from its policy work, the National Council on Disability serves as a valuable resource for disability-related information, giving interested groups access to articles, reports, and statistics via printed and digital media. Alongside existing self-advocacy groups, the work done by the National Council on Disability helps to ensure disabled individuals and their rights remain well represented in policy deliberation, media, and housing and employment opportunities. In her book, Disabled Rights: American Disability Policy and the Fight for Equality, Vaughn Switzer (2003) identified a change in the political atmosphere in the 1970s which allowed for disability policy to rise as a “legitimate issue on the policy agenda,” a notion which is radical in the context of history. Vaughn Switzer described a powerful statement made by the National Council on the Handicapped in 1983 that captured the essence of this change, that the disabled were no longer viewed as damaged, flawed, or dependent on government aid. Instead, “the council called on the government to shift to policies that achieve ‘maximum life potential, self-reliance, independence, productivity, and equitable mainstream social participation in the most productive and least restrictive environment” (as cited in Vaughn Switzer, 2003).” Such a significant shift is apparent in the rise of civil rights movements such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and in the increasing prominence of self-advocacy groups and neurodiversity proponents. With the President’s recent council appointment of Ari Ne’eman, the board’s first appointee with a spectrum disorder and a strong advocate of neurodiversity, disability policy stands at an important crossroads. He currently serves as president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN), a non-profit organization that fights to ensure that people with autism have the same “access, rights, and opportunities as all other citizens” (Sinclair, 2012). The success of such organizations reflects a growing movement that recognizes the need to encourage autonomy for disabled individuals. Due to the important role the council plays in advising the president on disability policy, Ne’eman’s appointment has the potential to drive the neurodiversity movement forward, fostering its growth and influence through increased promotion and policy implementation. One could interpret the President’s appointment as a gesture more significant than simply an endorsement of a qualified candidate; Ne’eman’s delegation could be seen as Obama’s effort to respond to the interests of the disabled and neurodiversity and self-advocacy proponents in particular. Additionally, opposition remains wary of Ne’eman’s strong neurodiversity stance on autism, fearing that with his appointment, resources will be directed away from research for a cure. One group of individuals voiced its outrage in a statement that attempts to identify Ne’eman’s stance as illogical: “without making the goals of prevention and cure a top priority, there will not be sufficient funding to adequately provide for the growing population of people with autism” (“Age of Autism,” 2010). Another petition by members of the Age of Autism group exemplifies intense disapproval of Ne’eman in its statement that he “rather than unifying the autism community, divides it” (2010). However, in spite of the dispute and temporary hold placed on the President’s nomination, the Senate approved Ne’eman’s appointment on June 22, 2010 (“NCD”). Rather, implementation of choice and varying degrees of intervention could serve as an effective way of respecting people with autism as independent individuals and ensuring treatment is not coercive. In the midst of an economic crisis and the appointment of Ari Ne’eman to the National Council on Disability, it is likely the government’s political stance on disability will face many changes in the near future. As budget cuts and redistribution of funds at both the national and state levels hang in the balance, it will be interesting to see how Ne’eman’s neurodiversity stance influences decisions made by the council and the course of change in disability policy. The capability of interventions to achieve results is undeniable and valuable for those who choose to participate, but that does not necessarily mean treatment should be mandatory. Expansion of the neurodiversity movement is sure to face resistance by proponents of the medical model, but successful integration of theory into a more self-directed system of treatment would be taking a step toward easing the inherent conflict of interests barring these two groups. Evidence of this process is embodied in the continually shifting political atmosphere and paradigm of disability. In his work through ASAN, Ari Ne’eman recognizes challenges but continues to strive to protect the civil rights of people with spectrum disorders with a goal of “creating a world in which all people can benefit from whatever […] may be necessary to empower them to participate fully in society, with respect and self-determination as the guiding principles” (“ASAN,” 2011). Autonomy, the Critical Journal of Interdisciplinary Autism Studies, 1(1). Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally.
