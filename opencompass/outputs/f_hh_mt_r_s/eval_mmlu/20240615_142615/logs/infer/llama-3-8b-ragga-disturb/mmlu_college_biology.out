['The logistic curve is a sigmoid curve that is commonly used to model the growth of a population. It is a mathematical representation of the growth of a population over time, and it is characterized by a slow start, a rapid growth phase, and a plateau phase. The curve is defined by the following equation:\n\nN(t) = (N0 * K) / (N0 * K + (e^(-r * t) - 1))\n\nwhere N(t) is the population at time t, N0 is the initial population, K is the carrying capacity, and r is the intrinsic rate of growth.\n\nThe carrying capacity is the maximum population that the environment can support. This is the point at which the population reaches a stable state and stops growing. The intrinsic rate of growth is the rate at which the population would grow if there were no limiting factors.\n\nThe logistic curve is useful for understanding population growth and for predicting future population sizes. It can also be used to model the growth of other systems, such as economic systems or disease outbreaks.\n\nIn terms of controlling mosquito populations, the most effective means is to reduce the carrying capacity. This can be done by removing breeding sites, such as standing water, or by introducing natural predators or parasites that prey on mosquitoes. By reducing the carrying capacity, the population will grow more slowly and will eventually reach a', 'Based on the characteristic population curves that result from plotting population growth of a species, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is toBased on the characteristic population curves that result from plotting population growth of a species, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is to\nA. maintain the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve\nB. opt for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached\nC. reduce the carrying capacity cif the environment to lower the K value\nD. increase the mortality rate']

  Biological exponential growth is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the habitat, the population of an organism living in the habitat grows in an exponential or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each

If, in a hypothetical population of size N, the birth rates (per capita) are represented as b and death rates (per capita) as d, then the increase or decrease in N during a time period t will be: (b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth. Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the elephant could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

 = the beneficial effect of a mutualistic partner's density. One of the simplest frameworks for modeling species interactions is the Lotka–Volterra equations. In this model, the change in population density of the two mutualists is quantified as: Mutualism is in essence the logistic growth equation + mutualistic interaction. The mutualistic interaction term represents the increase in population growth of species one as a result of the presence of greater numbers of species two, and vice versa. As the mutualistic term is always positive, it may lead to unrealistic unbounded growth as it happens with the simple model. So, it is important to include a saturation mechanism to avoid the problem.

  that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth. Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans. Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as Charles Darwin observed

  Assume that a population has three generations: First (oldest), Second (child bearing), and Third (children). Further assume that this population has a fertility rate equal to four (4). That is, each generation is twice the size of the previous. If the population of the first generation is arbitrarily set at 100, the second is then 200, and the third is 400. The spreadsheet below shows the initial population in the first row. First note that the second and third generation of the initial population are each twice the size of the previous. The total of the initial population is 700 = 100 + 200 + 400. Then assume that at the end of the third generation, fertility falls to

  At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the main determinant for population growth is just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the logistic equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density. The logistic growth curve is initially very similar to the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because

  A population is defined as a group of interacting organisms of the same species. A demographic structure of a population is how populations are often quantified. The total number of individuals in a population is defined as a population size, and how dense these individuals are is defined as population density. There is also a population’s geographic range, which has limits that a species can tolerate (such as temperature). Population size can be influenced by the per capita population growth rate (rate at which the population size changes per individual in the population.) Births, deaths, emigration, and immigration rates all play a significant role in growth rate. The maximum per capita growth rate for a population is known as the intrinsic rate of increase. In a population, carrying capacity is known as the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain, which is determined by resources available. In many classic population models, r is represented as the intrinsic growth rate, where K is the carrying capacity, and N0 is the initial population size.

  (for simplicity assume that to be two). Now take the population forward in time to the next generation, line two of the spreadsheet. The first generation dies, and the new generation, the fourth, is equal to the third (because now fertility is replacement). Repeat the process again to reach the fifth generation (line 3 in the spreadsheet). The fifth generation is again equal to the fourth and now the population’s three generations are equal, and the population has reached equilibrium. The initial population has grown from 700 to 1,200 even though fertility dropped from four to replacement (two) at the end of the third generation. Population momentum carried the population to higher levels over the next two generations.

   The major impact of intraspecific competition is reduced population growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, intraspecific competition does not occur and populations can grow exponentially. Exponential population growth is exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew exponentially in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place. . dN(t)/dt = rate of change of population density N(t) = population size at time t r = per capita growth rate K = carrying capacity  The logistic growth equation is an effective tool for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, and has been used to model many real biological

The logistic growth curve is initially very similar to the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because 
 2 141.00195  A population is defined as a group of interacting organisms of the same species. A demographic structure of a population is how populations are often quantified. The total number of individuals in a population is defined as a population size, and how dense these individuals are is defined as population density. There is also a population’s geographic range, which has limits that a species can tolerate (such as temperature). Population size can be influenced by the per capita population growth rate (rate at which the population size changes per individual in the population.) Births, deaths, emigration, and immigration rates all play a significant role in growth rate. The maximum per capita growth rate for a population is known as the intrinsic rate of increase. In a population, carrying capacity is known as the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain, which is determined by resources available. In many classic population models, r is represented as the intrinsic growth rate, where K is the carrying capacity, and N0 is the initial population size.

['A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that occurs when a single nucleotide is either inserted or deleted in a gene, causing a shift in the reading frame of the mRNA. This results in the production of a non-functional or truncated protein, as the altered reading frame causes a premature stop codon to be introduced, or the introduction of a premature stop codon due to the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide. Frameshift mutations can have significant effects on protein function and can lead to genetic disorders.\n\nFor example, in the case of sickle cell anemia, a frameshift mutation in the beta-globin gene causes a single amino acid substitution, resulting in the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein that can cause red blood cells to become misshapen and less effective at carrying oxygen. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and organ damage.\n\nIn contrast, in the case of cystic fibrosis, a frameshift mutation in the CFTR gene causes a premature stop codon to be introduced, resulting in the production of a non-functional CFTR protein. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including lung infections, digestive problems, and infertility.\n\nFrameshift mutations can also occur in non-coding regions', "A frameshift mutation is created whenA frameshift mutation is created when\nA. telomeric sequences are removed from DNA\nB. a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one\nC. a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene\nD. a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation"]

  Insertions can be particularly hazardous if they occur in an exon, the amino acid coding region of a gene. A frameshift mutation, an alteration in the normal reading frame of a gene, results if the number of inserted nucleotides is not divisible by three, i.e., the number of nucleotides per codon. Frameshift mutations will alter all the amino acids encoded by the gene following the mutation. Usually, insertions and the subsequent frameshift mutation will cause the active translation of the gene to encounter a premature stop codon, resulting in an end to translation and the production of a truncated protein. Transcripts carrying the frameshift mutation may also be degraded through Nonsense-mediated decay during translation, thus not resulting in any protein product. If

  Several mutations in the CFTR gene can occur, and different mutations cause different defects in the CFTR protein, sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease. These protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function. ΔF508-CFTR gene mutation, which occurs in >90% of patients in the U.S., creates a protein that does not fold normally and is not appropriately transported to the cell membrane, resulting in its degradation. Other mutations result in proteins that are too short (truncated) because production is ended prematurely. Other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy (in the form of ATP) normally,

  the truncated proteins frequently are unable to function properly or at all and can possibly result in any number of genetic disorders depending on the gene in which the insertion occurs. Methods to detect DNA sequencing errors were developed. In-frame insertions occur when the reading frame is not altered as a result of the insertion; the number of inserted nucleotides is divisible by three. The reading frame remains intact after the insertion and translation will most likely run to completion if the inserted nucleotides do not code for a stop codon. However, because of the inserted nucleotides, the finished protein will contain, depending on the size of the insertion, multiple new amino acids that may affect the function of the protein.

 Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are either inserted or deleted in the DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code. This shift alters the way codons are read during protein synthesis, leading to significant changes in the resulting polypeptide chain. 

Compared to missense and nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations can have more severe consequences. Missense mutations result in the substitution of a single amino acid in the protein sequence, whereas nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon, leading to the truncation of the polypeptide chain. Frameshift mutations, on the other hand, disrupt the entire reading frame, significantly altering the sequence of amino acids in the protein.

These mutations can have varying effects depending on the size and position of the insertion or deletion. If one or two nucleotides are added or removed, the resulting frameshift can lead to a completely different sequence of amino acids, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. In cases of deletions, one amino acid is usually deleted for every three nucleotides removed.

Frameshift mutations can have severe consequences and are associated with various genetic disorders. For example, conditions like cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease can be caused by frameshift mutations. The abundance of insertions in Huntington's disease disrupts the normal genetic code, leading to the degeneration of the nervous system.

In summary, frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, causing a shift in the reading frame during protein synthesis. These mutations can have significant consequences, altering the amino acid sequence and potentially affecting the structure and function of the resulting protein.

 The three major categories of mutations that cells can inherit are deletions, base substitutions (also known as point mutations), and insertions. Deletions occur when DNA polymerase fails to copy all the DNA in the parent strand, leading to the loss of genetic material. Base substitutions, on the other hand, happen when the wrong nucleotides are paired together during DNA replication. This results in a change of a single nucleotide, causing a point mutation. Finally, insertions occur when extra nucleotides are inserted into the DNA sequence during replication or repair processes.

Deletions can have various effects on an organism, depending on the size and location of the deleted DNA. They can lead to frameshift mutations, where the reading frame of the genetic code is altered, potentially resulting in a non-functional protein.

Base substitutions or point mutations can also have a range of effects. Silent mutations have no impact on the protein or organism, as they do not alter the amino acid sequence due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Missense mutations, on the other hand, change the amino acids in the protein, potentially affecting its structure and function. Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in the mRNA, resulting in the production of a truncated protein that is likely non-functional.

Insertions can cause frameshift mutations as well, similar to deletions. The addition of extra nucleotides disrupts the normal reading frame of the genetic code, altering the amino acid sequence and potentially leading to a non-functional protein.

It is important to note that the effects of mutations can vary greatly depending on the specific gene involved, the location and type of mutation, and the resulting changes to the protein.

  CF is caused by a mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation, ΔF508, is a deletion (Δ signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position on the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70% ) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 1500 other mutations can produce CF. Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an autosomal recessive disease. The CFTR gene, found at the q31.2

 There are several different types of mutations that can occur in DNA, each with their own effects on protein function. Some of the common types of mutations include frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, silent mutations, and missense mutations.

Frameshift mutations occur when a deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that are not divisible by three happens. This disrupts the reading frame of the DNA sequence and leads to misreading of all nucleotides downstream. Frameshift mutations usually result in the production of a nonfunctional protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, occur when a nucleotide substitution results in the creation of an early stop codon. This premature stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis, leading to the production of a truncated and often nonfunctional protein. An example of a disease caused by a nonsense mutation is sickle cell disease, where the substitution of a nucleotide leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein.

Silent mutations are nucleotide substitutions where the new codon codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. These mutations often occur at the third position of the codon, which is more flexible due to the phenomenon known as "tRNA wobble." Silent mutations do not result in any change in the amino acid sequence and typically have no effect on protein function.

Missense mutations, on the other hand, result in a nucleotide substitution that leads to the production of a different amino acid in the protein sequence. The impact of missense mutations on protein function can vary depending on the specific substitution. If the new amino acid has a similar chemical structure to the original amino acid, it is considered a conservative missense mutation. However, if the new amino acid is significantly different, it can affect the protein's structure and function. Sickle cell disease is an example of a missense mutation where the substitution of glutamic acid with valine in the hemoglobin protein leads to abnormal red blood cell shape.

In general, the severity of the damage caused by mutations can be ranked as follows: silent mutations have the least impact, followed by missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations, which have the most severe effects on protein function.

 A point mutation refers to a genetic mutation where a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted, or deleted from a DNA or RNA sequence of an organism's genome. This type of mutation can have various effects on protein production depending on the specific mutation. 

The consequences of point mutations can range from having no effect to causing significant changes in protein production, composition, and function. Some point mutations are synonymous, meaning they do not change the amino acid sequence and have no impact on protein production. However, other point mutations can lead to non-synonymous changes, altering the amino acid sequence and affecting protein structure and function. These non-synonymous mutations can be further classified into different types such as missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.

Missense mutations occur when a single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence. This change may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the specific amino acid substitution and its location within the protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, introduce a premature stop codon into the protein-coding sequence. This leads to the production of a truncated and usually non-functional protein. The premature termination of protein synthesis affects its structure and potentially disrupts its normal function.

Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a DNA or RNA sequence, altering the reading frame during translation. This can lead to a shift in the coding sequence, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. Frameshift mutations often have severe consequences as they dramatically change the protein's structure and function.

Point mutations are generally caused by DNA replication errors or exposure to mutagens, which can be physical (such as UV rays or X-rays) or chemical agents that disrupt DNA structure or base pairing. Understanding the causes and consequences of point mutations is important for studying genetic diseases, cancer development, and developing strategies for prevention and treatment.

 These 2 types of mutations can cause a shift in the open reading frame, called **frameshift mutations,** of a gene if the **insertion or deletion** is a **multiple of 1 or 2 bases.** However, an insertion is a mutation wherein 1 or more DNA bases have been added.Silent mutations do not affect thetranslated mRNA or final protein product–thus, the name _silent_**. The genetic code is degenerate, which means that most amino acids are encoded by several different codons or triplets of DNA/RNA bases. Therefore, it is possible to switch a single base but not alter the resulting protein product (Table 13-1). The **sickle cell trait** is a result of a **missense mutation. ** This type of point mutation actually **does alter the protein product. ** In the case of sickle cell hemoglobin, adenine is replaced by thymine, causing a hydrophilic glutamic acid to be replaced with a hydrophobic valine in the resulting protein (Table 13-2). In a **nonsense mutation, the mutation brings about a premature stop in the gene of interest** because the altered codon now represents a stop codon (Table 13-3). These are commonly seen in muscular dystrophies and some cystic fibrosis cases. **Aminoglycosides are currently being used to treat premature stop codons** as they affect the translational accuracy of transfer RNA (tRNA), thereby allowing recognition of incorrect codons including the stop codon. Ultimately, the translation machinery reads through the premature stop codon because of altered amino acid insertion by tRNA and produces full-length protein instead of a truncated protein or degraded messenger RNA (mRNA). **Table 13-1 • EXAMPLES OF MUTATIONAL EVENTS SILENT MUTATION**

**Table 13-2 • MISSENSE MUTATION**

**Table 13-3 • NONSENSE MUTATION**

**Table 13-4 • FRAMESHIFT MUTATION**

Another type of mutation is a **deletion in which 1 or more DNA bases have been removed. ** However, an insertion is a mutation wherein 1 or more DNA bases have been added. These 2 types of mutations can cause a shift in the open reading frame, called **frameshift mutations,** of a gene if the **insertion or deletion** is a **multiple of 1 or 2 bases.Both cases present major problems because the altered protein will not likely be able to carry out the normal duties required of it.Because codons are read as multiples of 3, an insertion or deletion of 3 or a multiple of 3 may or may not be as deleterious to the gene as multiples of 1 or 2.

 1 161.58228 Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are either inserted or deleted in the DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code. This shift alters the way codons are read during protein synthesis, leading to significant changes in the resulting polypeptide chain. 

Compared to missense and nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations can have more severe consequences. Missense mutations result in the substitution of a single amino acid in the protein sequence, whereas nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon, leading to the truncation of the polypeptide chain. Frameshift mutations, on the other hand, disrupt the entire reading frame, significantly altering the sequence of amino acids in the protein.

These mutations can have varying effects depending on the size and position of the insertion or deletion. If one or two nucleotides are added or removed, the resulting frameshift can lead to a completely different sequence of amino acids, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. In cases of deletions, one amino acid is usually deleted for every three nucleotides removed.

Frameshift mutations can have severe consequences and are associated with various genetic disorders. For example, conditions like cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease can be caused by frameshift mutations. The abundance of insertions in Huntington's disease disrupts the normal genetic code, leading to the degeneration of the nervous system.

In summary, frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, causing a shift in the reading frame during protein synthesis. These mutations can have significant consequences, altering the amino acid sequence and potentially affecting the structure and function of the resulting protein.
 2 154.70557  Insertions can be particularly hazardous if they occur in an exon, the amino acid coding region of a gene. A frameshift mutation, an alteration in the normal reading frame of a gene, results if the number of inserted nucleotides is not divisible by three, i.e., the number of nucleotides per codon. Frameshift mutations will alter all the amino acids encoded by the gene following the mutation. Usually, insertions and the subsequent frameshift mutation will cause the active translation of the gene to encounter a premature stop codon, resulting in an end to translation and the production of a truncated protein. Transcripts carrying the frameshift mutation may also be degraded through Nonsense-mediated decay during translation, thus not resulting in any protein product. If 
 3 123.72266 These 2 types of mutations can cause a shift in the open reading frame, called **frameshift mutations,** of a gene if the **insertion or deletion** is a **multiple of 1 or 2 bases.** However, an insertion is a mutation wherein 1 or more DNA bases have been added.Silent mutations do not affect thetranslated mRNA or final protein product–thus, the name _silent_**. The genetic code is degenerate, which means that most amino acids are encoded by several different codons or triplets of DNA/RNA bases. Therefore, it is possible to switch a single base but not alter the resulting protein product (Table 13-1). The **sickle cell trait** is a result of a **missense mutation. ** This type of point mutation actually **does alter the protein product. ** In the case of sickle cell hemoglobin, adenine is replaced by thymine, causing a hydrophilic glutamic acid to be replaced with a hydrophobic valine in the resulting protein (Table 13-2). In a **nonsense mutation, the mutation brings about a premature stop in the gene of interest** because the altered codon now represents a stop codon (Table 13-3). These are commonly seen in muscular dystrophies and some cystic fibrosis cases. **Aminoglycosides are currently being used to treat premature stop codons** as they affect the translational accuracy of transfer RNA (tRNA), thereby allowing recognition of incorrect codons including the stop codon. Ultimately, the translation machinery reads through the premature stop codon because of altered amino acid insertion by tRNA and produces full-length protein instead of a truncated protein or degraded messenger RNA (mRNA). **Table 13-1 • EXAMPLES OF MUTATIONAL EVENTS SILENT MUTATION**

 4 120.37500 There are several different types of mutations that can occur in DNA, each with their own effects on protein function. Some of the common types of mutations include frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, silent mutations, and missense mutations.

Frameshift mutations occur when a deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides that are not divisible by three happens. This disrupts the reading frame of the DNA sequence and leads to misreading of all nucleotides downstream. Frameshift mutations usually result in the production of a nonfunctional protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, occur when a nucleotide substitution results in the creation of an early stop codon. This premature stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis, leading to the production of a truncated and often nonfunctional protein. An example of a disease caused by a nonsense mutation is sickle cell disease, where the substitution of a nucleotide leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin protein.

Silent mutations are nucleotide substitutions where the new codon codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. These mutations often occur at the third position of the codon, which is more flexible due to the phenomenon known as "tRNA wobble." Silent mutations do not result in any change in the amino acid sequence and typically have no effect on protein function.

Missense mutations, on the other hand, result in a nucleotide substitution that leads to the production of a different amino acid in the protein sequence. The impact of missense mutations on protein function can vary depending on the specific substitution. If the new amino acid has a similar chemical structure to the original amino acid, it is considered a conservative missense mutation. However, if the new amino acid is significantly different, it can affect the protein's structure and function. Sickle cell disease is an example of a missense mutation where the substitution of glutamic acid with valine in the hemoglobin protein leads to abnormal red blood cell shape.

In general, the severity of the damage caused by mutations can be ranked as follows: silent mutations have the least impact, followed by missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations, which have the most severe effects on protein function.

 5 113.84607 A point mutation refers to a genetic mutation where a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted, or deleted from a DNA or RNA sequence of an organism's genome. This type of mutation can have various effects on protein production depending on the specific mutation. 

The consequences of point mutations can range from having no effect to causing significant changes in protein production, composition, and function. Some point mutations are synonymous, meaning they do not change the amino acid sequence and have no impact on protein production. However, other point mutations can lead to non-synonymous changes, altering the amino acid sequence and affecting protein structure and function. These non-synonymous mutations can be further classified into different types such as missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.

Missense mutations occur when a single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence. This change may or may not affect the protein's function, depending on the specific amino acid substitution and its location within the protein.

Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, introduce a premature stop codon into the protein-coding sequence. This leads to the production of a truncated and usually non-functional protein. The premature termination of protein synthesis affects its structure and potentially disrupts its normal function.

Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in a DNA or RNA sequence, altering the reading frame during translation. This can lead to a shift in the coding sequence, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. Frameshift mutations often have severe consequences as they dramatically change the protein's structure and function.

Point mutations are generally caused by DNA replication errors or exposure to mutagens, which can be physical (such as UV rays or X-rays) or chemical agents that disrupt DNA structure or base pairing. Understanding the causes and consequences of point mutations is important for studying genetic diseases, cancer development, and developing strategies for prevention and treatment.

  Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage. Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. Older sources, particularly before the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as "higher vertebrates" and anamniotes as "lower vertebrates", based on the antiquated idea of the evolutionary great chain of being. The term amniote comes from the Greek ἀμνίον amnion, "membrane surrounding the fetus", and earlier "bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught", from ἀμνός amnos, "lamb". The amnion comprises several extensive membranes. In eutherian mammals (such as humans), these include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. The

  formation of several extensive membranes, the amnion, chorion, and allantois. Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with limbs and a thick stratified epithelium (rather than first entering a feeding larval tadpole stage followed by metamorphosis, as amphibians do). In amniotes, the transition from a two-layered periderm to a cornified epithelium is triggered by thyroid hormone during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis. The unique embryonic features of amniotes may reflect specializations for eggs to survive drier environments; or the increase in size and yolk content of eggs may have permitted, and coevolved with, direct development of the embryo to a large size.

 The function of the amniotic sac in the development of a mammal, bird, or reptile embryo or fetus is to protect and support the developing embryo/fetus. The amniotic sac, also known as the amnion, is a thin, tough, membranous sac that encloses the embryo/fetus. It is filled with a serous fluid called amniotic fluid, in which the embryo/fetus is suspended.

The amniotic sac serves several important functions. Firstly, it provides a protective barrier that helps to cushion the developing embryo/fetus from external shocks and injuries. It acts as a physical barrier, shielding the growing organism from any direct contact with the environment.

Secondly, the amniotic fluid within the sac helps to regulate the temperature of the embryo/fetus. It helps to maintain a stable and optimal temperature, which is crucial for proper development. The fluid also helps to prevent the embryo/fetus from drying out and provides a medium for movement, allowing the embryo/fetus to stretch, flex, and develop muscle tone.

Additionally, the amniotic fluid plays a vital role in the development of the respiratory and digestive systems of the embryo/fetus. By swallowing and inhaling the fluid, the embryo/fetus practices breathing and swallowing movements, which are essential for the proper functioning of these systems after birth.

In summary, the amniotic sac functions to protect, support, and provide an optimal environment for the development of the embryo/fetus. It acts as a physical barrier, regulates temperature, prevents dehydration, and aids in the development of vital systems.

  appears they separated from the other tetrapods somewhere during Romer's gap, when the adult tetrapods became fully terrestrial (some forms would later become secondarily aquatic). The modest-sized ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, such as depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the Carboniferous swamps and forests; and dry conditions probably do not account for the emergence of the soft shell. Indeed, many modern-day amniotes require moisture to keep their eggs from desiccating. Although some modern amphibians lay eggs on land, all amphibians lack advanced traits like an amnion. The amniotic egg formed through a series of evolutionary steps. After internal fertilization and the habit of laying

  The hyaline layer is responsible for the adhesion and proper orientation if the cells of an embryo. Throughout development, certain cells change their binding affinity towards hyalin. Hyalin helps cells differentiate into the animal and the vegetal halves during oogenesis by utilizing zinc and lithium ions. Zinc enhances the amount of hyalin precipitated, while lithium keeps the hyalin solubilized when around calcium. Zinc, then, causes an animalizing effect since the binding of the blastula cells would be stronger, while the weaker attachment of the cells would form the vegetal half. Cells can further differentiate if they gain an affinity towards other membranes. Invagination of the blastula

  in terrestrial environments became a reproduction strategy amongst the amniote ancestors, the next major breakthrough appears to have involved a gradual replacement of the gelatinous coating covering the amphibian egg with a fibrous shell membrane. This allowed the egg to increase both its size and in the rate of gas exchange, permitting a larger, metabolically more active embryo to reach full development before hatching. Further developments, like extraembryonic membranes (amnion, chorion, and allantois) and a calcified shell, were not essential and probably evolved later. It has been suggested that shelled terrestrial eggs without extraembryonic membranes could still not have been more than about 1 cm (0.4 inch) in diameter because of diffusion problems,

  a blastocyst. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the zona pellucida. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells. The blastocyst reaches the uterus at roughly the fifth day after fertilization. It is here that lysis of the zona pellucida occurs. This process is analogous to zona hatching, a term that refers to the emergence of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, when incubated in vitro. This allows the trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst to come into contact with, and adhere to, the endometrial cells of the uterus. The trophectoderm will eventually give rise to extra-embryonic structures, such as the placenta and the

  Fish and amphibian eggs have only one inner membrane, the embryonic membrane. Evolution of the amniote egg required increased exchange of gases and wastes between the embryo and the atmosphere. Structures to permit these traits allowed further adaption that increased the feasible size of amniote eggs and enabled breeding in progressively drier habitats. The increased size of eggs permitted increase in size of offspring and consequently of adults. Further growth for the latter, however, was limited by their position in the terrestrial food-chain, which was restricted to level three and below, with only invertebrates occupying level two. Amniotes would eventually experience adaptive radiations when some species evolved the ability to digest plants and new ecological niches opened up, permitting larger body-size for herbivores, omnivores and predators.

 In addition to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast is responsible for giving rise to another important structure during early embryonic development. This structure is known as the extra-embryonic membranes, which include the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. The trophoblast plays a crucial role in the formation of these membranes, which provide support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo.

The amnion is an important component of the extra-embryonic membranes, and it surrounds the embryo, forming a fluid-filled sac called the amniotic sac. This sac serves to cushion the developing fetus, providing a protective environment during the course of pregnancy.

The chorion is another extra-embryonic membrane that develops from the trophoblast. It becomes the outermost layer of the placenta, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste between the mother and the developing embryo.

The yolk sac, also derived from the trophoblast, plays a crucial role in the early stages of embryonic development. It initially provides nourishment to the embryo before the placenta takes over this role. Additionally, the yolk sac also contributes to the formation of the primitive germ cells, which are essential for the development of the reproductive system.

Lastly, the allantois is an extra-embryonic membrane that arises from the trophoblast. It plays a role in the disposal of waste products and eventually plays a part in the development of the urinary bladder.

In summary, besides giving rise to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast also gives rise to the extra-embryonic membranes, including the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. These structures provide crucial support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo during early embryonic development.

 The chick possesses a set of extraembryonic membranes that support the embryo and facilitate the transfer of nutrients and oxygen. These membranes include the yolk sac, the chorion, the amnion, and the allantois. 

The yolk sac is responsible for providing nutrients to the developing embryo. It surrounds the yolk, which contains the necessary nutrients for the embryo's growth. Blood vessels within the yolk sac transport these nutrients to the embryo.

The chorion is the outermost membrane and plays a significant role in gas exchange. It is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the surrounding environment. This is achieved through a specialized structure called the chorioallantoic membrane, which contains a network of blood vessels that facilitate the exchange of gases.

The amnion is a fluid-filled sac that surrounds and protects the developing embryo. It provides a cushioning effect and helps to maintain a stable environment in which the embryo can develop. The amniotic fluid within the amnion also acts as a medium for the exchange of nutrients and wastes.

Lastly, the allantois is involved in the storage and disposal of waste materials produced by the embryo. It serves as a reservoir for nitrogenous waste and helps in the removal of these waste products from the embryo.

Together, these extraembryonic membranes in the chick work synergistically to support the embryo's growth and development by providing nutrients, facilitating gas exchange, protecting the embryo, and disposing of waste materials.

 1 92.01562 In addition to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast is responsible for giving rise to another important structure during early embryonic development. This structure is known as the extra-embryonic membranes, which include the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. The trophoblast plays a crucial role in the formation of these membranes, which provide support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo.

The amnion is an important component of the extra-embryonic membranes, and it surrounds the embryo, forming a fluid-filled sac called the amniotic sac. This sac serves to cushion the developing fetus, providing a protective environment during the course of pregnancy.

The chorion is another extra-embryonic membrane that develops from the trophoblast. It becomes the outermost layer of the placenta, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste between the mother and the developing embryo.

The yolk sac, also derived from the trophoblast, plays a crucial role in the early stages of embryonic development. It initially provides nourishment to the embryo before the placenta takes over this role. Additionally, the yolk sac also contributes to the formation of the primitive germ cells, which are essential for the development of the reproductive system.

Lastly, the allantois is an extra-embryonic membrane that arises from the trophoblast. It plays a role in the disposal of waste products and eventually plays a part in the development of the urinary bladder.

In summary, besides giving rise to the intra-embryonic mesoderm, the trophoblast also gives rise to the extra-embryonic membranes, including the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois. These structures provide crucial support, nourishment, and protection to the developing embryo during early embryonic development.

 3 68.48633  Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage. Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. Older sources, particularly before the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as "higher vertebrates" and anamniotes as "lower vertebrates", based on the antiquated idea of the evolutionary great chain of being. The term amniote comes from the Greek ἀμνίον amnion, "membrane surrounding the fetus", and earlier "bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught", from ἀμνός amnos, "lamb". The amnion comprises several extensive membranes. In eutherian mammals (such as humans), these include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. The

The amniotic sac, also known as the amnion, is a thin, tough, membranous sac that encloses the embryo/fetus. It is filled with a serous fluid called amniotic fluid, in which the embryo/fetus is suspended.

The amniotic sac serves several important functions. Firstly, it provides a protective barrier that helps to cushion the developing embryo/fetus from external shocks and injuries. It acts as a physical barrier, shielding the growing organism from any direct contact with the environment.

Secondly, the amniotic fluid within the sac helps to regulate the temperature of the embryo/fetus. It helps to maintain a stable and optimal temperature, which is crucial for proper development. The fluid also helps to prevent the embryo/fetus from drying out and provides a medium for movement, allowing the embryo/fetus to stretch, flex, and develop muscle tone.

Additionally, the amniotic fluid plays a vital role in the development of the respiratory and digestive systems of the embryo/fetus. By swallowing and inhaling the fluid, the embryo/fetus practices breathing and swallowing movements, which are essential for the proper functioning of these systems after birth.

In summary, the amniotic sac functions to protect, support, and provide an optimal environment for the development of the embryo/fetus. It acts as a physical barrier, regulates temperature, prevents dehydration, and aids in the development of vital systems.

['Inositol triphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that stimulates the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, in response to various extracellular signals. IP3 is produced by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). The binding of extracellular signals, such as neurotransmitters or hormones, to their receptors on the cell surface activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 then binds to its receptor, the IP3 receptor (IP3R), on the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the opening of calcium channels and the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. This calcium ion influx can trigger various cellular responses, such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Which of the following is a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm?Which of the following is a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm?\nA.

  Inositol trisphosphate or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate abbreviated InsP3 or Ins3P or IP3 is an inositol phosphate signaling molecule. It is made by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by phospholipase C (PLC). Together with diacylglycerol (DAG), IP3 is a second messenger molecule used in signal transduction in biological cells. While DAG stays inside the membrane, IP3 is soluble and diffuses through the cell, where it binds to its receptor, which is a calcium channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum. When IP3 binds its receptor, calcium is released into the cytosol, thereby activating various calcium regulated intracellular signals.

  and is capable of diffusing through the cytoplasm to the ER, or the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the case of muscle cells, once it has been produced by the action of PLC. Once at the ER, IP3 is able to bind to the IIns(1,4,5)P3 receptor Ins(1,4,5)P3R on a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel that is found on the surface of the ER. The binding of IP3 (the ligand in this case) to Ins(1,4,5)P3R triggers the opening of the Ca2+ channel, and thus release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. In heart muscle cells this increase in Ca2+ activates the ryanodine receptor-operated channel on the SR, results in further increases in Ca2+ through a process known as calcium-induced calcium release. IP3 may also activate Ca2+ channels on the cell membrane indirectly, by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

  IP3's main functions are to mobilize Ca2+ from storage organelles and to regulate cell proliferation and other cellular reactions that require free calcium. In smooth muscle cells, for example, an increase in concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ results in the contraction of the muscle cell. In the nervous system, IP3 serves as a second messenger, with the cerebellum containing the highest concentration of IP3 receptors. There is evidence that IP3 receptors play an important role in the induction of plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

  Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are often a result of IP3 activation. When a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to a Gq heterotrimeric G protein, the α-subunit of Gq can bind to and induce activity in the PLC isozyme PLC-β, which results in the cleavage of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. If a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is involved in activating the pathway, the isozyme PLC-γ has tyrosine residues that can become phosphorylated upon activation of an RTK, and this will activate PLC-γ and allow it to cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP3. This occurs in cells that are capable of responding to growth factors such as insulin, because the growth factors are the ligands responsible for activating the RTK.

  1981 were able to show that PIP2 is hydrolyzed into DAG and IP3 by a then unknown phosphodiesterase. In 1984 it was discovered that IP3 acts as a secondary messenger that is capable of traveling through the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it stimulates the release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Further research provided valuable information on the IP3 pathway, such as the discovery in 1986 that one of the many roles of the calcium released by IP3 is to work with DAG to activate protein kinase C (PKC). It was discovered in 1989 that phospholipase C (PLC) is the phosphodiesterase responsible for hydrolyzing PIP2 into DAG and IP3. Today the IP3 signaling pathway is well mapped out, and is known to be important in regulating a variety of calcium-dependent cell signaling pathways.

  IP3, DAG, and Ca2+ are second messengers in the phosphoinositol pathway. The pathway begins with the binding of extracellular primary messengers such as epinephrine, acetylcholine, and hormones AGT, GnRH, GHRH, oxytocin, and TRH, to their respective receptors. Epinephrine binds to the α1 GTPase Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and acetylcholine binds to M1 and M2 GPCR.  Binding of a primary messenger to these receptors results in conformational change of the receptor. The α subunit, with the help of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFS), releases GDP, and binds GTP, resulting in the dissociation of the subunit and subsequent activation. The activated α subunit activates phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in the formation of secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to calcium pumps on ER, transporting Ca2+, another second messenger, into the cytoplasm. Ca2+ ultimately binds to many proteins, activating a cascade of enzymatic pathways.

  The slow block to polyspermy in the sea urchin is mediated by the PIP2 secondary messenger system. Activation of the binding receptors activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 in the egg plasma membrane, releasing IP3 into the egg cell cytoplasm. IP3 diffuses to the ER, where it opens Ca2+ channels.

 Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) serves an important function in cellular signaling by promoting the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytoplasm. This process is known as calcium release from the ER stores. 

Calcium is a crucial molecule for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and gene expression. IP3 acts as a second messenger, relaying signals from the cell membrane to the ER. 

When a signaling molecule, such as a hormone or a neurotransmitter, binds to its respective receptor on the cell surface, it triggers a cascade of intracellular events. This includes the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), an enzyme that hydrolyzes a specific phospholipid called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). 

IP3 then diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) present on the ER membrane. This binding causes a conformational change in the IP3R, leading to the opening of calcium ion channels in the ER membrane. Consequently, calcium ions are released from the internal stores of the ER and enter the cytoplasm.

The released calcium ions can now interact with various calcium-binding proteins within the cytoplasm, triggering a wide range of cellular responses. These responses can include muscle contraction, enzyme activation, release of neurotransmitters, gene transcription, and many other important processes.

In summary, the function of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is to facilitate the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, leading to the activation of various cellular processes.

 When calcium is released into the cytosol, it has a significant impact on intracellular signaling. The release of calcium into the cytosol occurs when inositol trisphosphate (IP3) binds to its receptor, which is a calcium channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium is a crucial step in signal transduction within biological cells.

IP3 is produced through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by an enzyme called phospholipase C (PLC). IP3 is soluble and can diffuse through the cell, allowing it to bind to its receptor. Once IP3 binds to its receptor, it triggers the opening of the calcium channel, leading to the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol.

The increase in cytosolic calcium concentration serves as a second messenger, subsequently activating various calcium-regulated intracellular signals. Calcium ions are highly versatile and play diverse roles in signaling cascades. They can interact with a wide range of proteins, such as calmodulin, to regulate enzyme activity, gene expression, neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and many other cellular processes.

The binding of IP3 to its receptor and the subsequent release of calcium into the cytosol is a crucial mechanism for transmitting signals within cells. This process allows for the propagation of signals initiated by extracellular stimuli and ensures the appropriate activation of downstream signaling pathways.

Reference:
Inositol trisphosphate or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate abbreviated InsP3 or Ins3P or IP3 is an inositol phosphate signaling molecule. It is made by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by phospholipase C (PLC).\nTogether with diacylglycerol (DAG), IP3 is a second messenger molecule used in signal transduction in biological cells. While DAG stays inside the membrane, IP3 is soluble and diffuses through the cell, where it binds to its receptor, which is a calcium channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum. When IP3 binds its receptor, calcium is released into the cytosol, thereby activating various calcium regulated intracellular signals.

 1 113.77344 Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) serves an important function in cellular signaling by promoting the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytoplasm. This process is known as calcium release from the ER stores. 

Calcium is a crucial molecule for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and gene expression. IP3 acts as a second messenger, relaying signals from the cell membrane to the ER. 

When a signaling molecule, such as a hormone or a neurotransmitter, binds to its respective receptor on the cell surface, it triggers a cascade of intracellular events. This includes the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), an enzyme that hydrolyzes a specific phospholipid called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). 

IP3 then diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) present on the ER membrane. This binding causes a conformational change in the IP3R, leading to the opening of calcium ion channels in the ER membrane. Consequently, calcium ions are released from the internal stores of the ER and enter the cytoplasm.

The released calcium ions can now interact with various calcium-binding proteins within the cytoplasm, triggering a wide range of cellular responses. These responses can include muscle contraction, enzyme activation, release of neurotransmitters, gene transcription, and many other important processes.

In summary, the function of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is to facilitate the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, leading to the activation of various cellular processes.
 2 94.96484  1981 were able to show that PIP2 is hydrolyzed into DAG and IP3 by a then unknown phosphodiesterase. In 1984 it was discovered that IP3 acts as a secondary messenger that is capable of traveling through the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it stimulates the release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Further research provided valuable information on the IP3 pathway, such as the discovery in 1986 that one of the many roles of the calcium released by IP3 is to work with DAG to activate protein kinase C (PKC). It was discovered in 1989 that phospholipase C (PLC) is the phosphodiesterase responsible for hydrolyzing PIP2 into DAG and IP3. Today the IP3 signaling pathway is well mapped out, and is known to be important in regulating a variety of calcium-dependent cell signaling pathways.

 5 52.41797  IP3's main functions are to mobilize Ca2+ from storage organelles and to regulate cell proliferation and other cellular reactions that require free calcium. In smooth muscle cells, for example, an increase in concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ results in the contraction of the muscle cell. In the nervous system, IP3 serves as a second messenger, with the cerebellum containing the highest concentration of IP3 receptors. There is evidence that IP3 receptors play an important role in the induction of plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells.

["The synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template requires the use of a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase. This process involves the addition of a DNA or RNA primer to the 3' end of the RNA template, followed by the extension of the primer by reverse transcriptase. The resulting product is a DNA/RNA hybrid, which can be used for various purposes, such as cloning, sequencing, and amplification.\n\nThe primer used in this process can be either DNA or RNA, depending on the specific application. For example, if the RNA template is to be cloned into a plasmid vector, a DNA primer is typically used.

  Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. An example of a retrovirus is HIV. Reverse transcriptase is commonly employed in amplification of RNA for research purposes. Using an RNA template, PCR can utilize reverse transcriptase, creating a DNA template. This new DNA template can then be used for typical PCR amplification. The products of such an experiment are thus amplified PCR products from RNA. Each HIV retrovirus particle contains two RNA genomes, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus. After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination). From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

  Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings. The close association between RT-PCR and qPCR has led to metonymic use of the term qPCR to mean RT-PCR. Such use may be confusing, as RT-PCR can be used without qPCR, for example to enable molecular cloning, sequencing or simple detection of RNA. Conversely, qPCR may be used without RT-PCR, for example to quantify the copy number of a specific piece of DNA.

  In biotechnology applications, T7 RNA polymerase is commonly used to transcribe DNA that has been cloned into vectors that have two (different) phage promoters (e.g., T7 and T3, or T7 and SP6) in opposite orientation. RNA can be selectively synthesized from either strand of the insert DNA with the different polymerases. The enzyme is stimulated by spermidine and in vitro activity is increased by the presence of carrier proteins (such as BSA) Homogeneously labeled single-stranded RNA can be generated with this system. Transcripts can be non-radioactively labeled to high specific activity with certain labeled nucleotides.

 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).

In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977).  These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

Structure 

The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

Replication fidelity 

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

Template switching

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus.  After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination).  There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle.  Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

Applications

Antiviral drugs 

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

Molecular biology 

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

Reverse transcriptase has also been employed in insulin production. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Large amounts of insulin can then be created, sidestepping the need to harvest pig pancreas and other such traditional sources. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Processing in the eukaryotic cell during mRNA production removes these introns to provide a suitable template. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.

 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).

In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977).  These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

Structure 

The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

Replication fidelity 

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

Template switching

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus.  After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination).  There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle.  Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

Applications

Antiviral drugs 

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

Molecular biology 

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

Reverse transcriptase has also been employed in insulin production. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Large amounts of insulin can then be created, sidestepping the need to harvest pig pancreas and other such traditional sources. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Processing in the eukaryotic cell during mRNA production removes these introns to provide a suitable template. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.

  Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to molecular cloning and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 1 217.06348  Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. An example of a retrovirus is HIV. Reverse transcriptase is commonly employed in amplification of RNA for research purposes. Using an RNA template, PCR can utilize reverse transcriptase, creating a DNA template. This new DNA template can then be used for typical PCR amplification. The products of such an experiment are thus amplified PCR products from RNA. Each HIV retrovirus particle contains two RNA genomes, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus. After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination). From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.
 2 213.58594  Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings. The close association between RT-PCR and qPCR has led to metonymic use of the term qPCR to mean RT-PCR. Such use may be confusing, as RT-PCR can be used without qPCR, for example to enable molecular cloning, sequencing or simple detection of RNA. Conversely, qPCR may be used without RT-PCR, for example to quantify the copy number of a specific piece of DNA.

 4 201.07178 A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
 M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
 AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
 Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

Function in viruses 

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

Retroviral reverse transcription 

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5’ end of the RNA.
The tRNA primer then "jumps" to the 3’ end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).

In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977).  These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

Structure 

The reverse transcriptase employs a "right hand" structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

Replication fidelity 

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

Template switching

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus.  After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination).  There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle.  Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

Applications

Antiviral drugs 

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

Molecular biology 

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

Reverse transcriptase has also been employed in insulin production. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Large amounts of insulin can then be created, sidestepping the need to harvest pig pancreas and other such traditional sources. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Processing in the eukaryotic cell during mRNA production removes these introns to provide a suitable template. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated tail. Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS. Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA. The tRNA primer leaves and a "jump" happens. Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme integrase. Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed. The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an antisense DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). In cellular life 

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication. Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977). In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV. Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune). The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA. By inserting eukaryotic mRNA for insulin production along with reverse transcriptase into bacteria, the mRNA could be inserted into the prokaryote's genome. Directly inserting eukaryotic DNA into bacteria would not work because it carries introns, so would not translate successfully using the bacterial ribosomes. Reverse transcriptase converts this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome. See also

2024-06-15 14:29:32 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by  retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis. History 
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Rous sarcoma virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas. M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer. AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription

  Population genetics describes the genetic composition of a population, including allele frequencies, and how allele frequencies are expected to change over time. The Hardy–Weinberg law describes the expected equilibrium genotype frequencies in a diploid population after random mating. Random mating alone does not change allele frequencies, and the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assumes an infinite population size and a selectively neutral locus. In natural populations natural selection (adaptation mechanism), gene flow, and mutation combine to change allele frequencies across generations. Genetic drift causes changes in allele frequency from random sampling due to offspring number variance in a finite population size, with small populations experiencing larger per generation fluctuations in frequency than large populations. There is also a theory that second adaptation mechanism exists –

 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that describes the distribution of alleles in a non-evolving population. It provides a mathematical model to estimate the frequency of different genotypes and alleles in a population. The law states that in the absence of certain factors, such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, migration, and non-random mating, the frequency of alleles in a population will remain constant from generation to generation. 

By excluding natural selection as an option, we understand that the Hardy Weinberg law indicates that the relative frequency of different alleles within a population will remain constant over time, as long as no other factors that influence gene frequencies are present. This equilibrium implies that the population is not evolving and serves as a useful null hypothesis for studying genetic variation in natural populations. However, in reality, natural selection is an important factor that can cause changes in allele frequencies, leading to evolution over time.

It is worth noting that the Hardy-Weinberg law assumes an idealized population with certain conditions, such as a large population size, random mating, absence of mutation, migration, and selection. In real-world populations, these assumptions may not hold true, and deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can indicate the presence of evolutionary forces at work. Therefore, the law serves as a valuable tool for studying populations and understanding how genetic variation can change over time.

 The law that states that the relative frequency of each gene allele tends to remain constant from generation to generation is known as the Hardy-Weinberg law. This principle describes the genetic equilibrium in a population under certain conditions. According to the Hardy-Weinberg law, the allele frequencies in a population will remain stable if certain assumptions are met. These assumptions include a large population size, random mating, no migration, no mutation, and no natural selection. When these conditions are satisfied, the law predicts that the gene pool of a population will remain constant over time, with no changes in allele frequencies. However, any deviation from these assumptions can lead to changes in the gene pool, resulting in genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, or natural selection. It is important to note that while the Hardy-Weinberg law provides a theoretical framework, real populations often do not perfectly conform to these assumptions.

In a diploid population there are three possible genotypes, two homozygous genotypes (AA and BB), and one heterozygous genotype (AB). If we sample 10 individuals from the population, and we observe the genotype frequencies then there are of the B allele, out of 20 total chromosome copies. The frequency p of the A allele is p = 15/20 = 0.75, and the frequency q of the B allele is q = 5/20 = 0.25.

 Factors that affect the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law include random mating, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and natural selection. Random mating refers to the idea that individuals in a population choose their mates without any bias towards specific traits. This ensures that all genotypes have an equal chance of being passed on to the next generation. 

Genetic drift, on the other hand, refers to the random changes in allele frequencies that can occur in small populations due to chance events. This can lead to deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

Gene flow occurs when individuals migrate between different populations, introducing new alleles or removing existing ones. This can disrupt the equilibrium if the migrating individuals have different allele frequencies than the recipient population. 

Mutation is another factor that can alter allele frequencies. Mutations create new genetic variations, which can change the gene pool of a population and affect the equilibrium. 

Finally, natural selection is the process by which certain traits are favored or disfavored in a population. If certain genotypes have a higher fitness than others, they will be selected for and their frequencies will increase, disrupting the equilibrium. 

Overall, these factors can individually or collectively influence the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law, highlighting the dynamic nature of genetic populations. The answer is B.

  If If there are more than two different allelic forms, the frequency for each allele is simply the frequency of its homozygote plus half the sum of the frequencies for all the heterozygotes in which it appears. (For 3 alleles see ) Allele frequency can always be calculated from genotype frequency, whereas the reverse requires that the Hardy–Weinberg conditions of random mating apply.

  The Hardy–Weinberg principle states that under certain idealised conditions, including the absence of selection pressures, a large population will have no change in the frequency of alleles as generations pass. A population that satisfies these conditions is said to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. In particular, Hardy and Weinberg showed that dominant and recessive alleles do not automatically tend to become more and less frequent respectively, as had been thought previously. The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include that there must be no mutations, immigration, or emigration, all of which can directly change allelic frequencies. Additionally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles. A population that is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is analogous to a deck of cards; no matter how many times the deck is shuffled, no new cards are added and no old ones are taken away. Cards in the deck represent alleles in a population's gene pool. In practice, no population can be in perfect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The population's finite size, combined with natural selection and many other effects, cause the allelic frequencies to change over time.

It provides a mathematical model for predicting the frequencies of alleles in a population from one generation to the next, assuming certain conditions are met. These conditions include a large population size, random mating, no mutations, no migration, and no natural selection.

The Hardy-Weinberg law allows scientists to make predictions about how genetic traits are inherited and how they may change over time within a population. By understanding the frequencies of alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of genetic diversity and evolution. This law is particularly useful in studying traits that are influenced by a single gene locus with two alleles, such as blood type or certain genetic disorders.

In summary, the Hardy-Weinberg law is a fundamental principle in population genetics that helps scientists understand how gene frequencies can remain stable or change within populations over generations. By studying this law, researchers can gain valuable insights into genetic diversity, inheritance patterns, and evolutionary processes.

 1 161.56152 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that is related to the study of gene frequencies within populations. It provides a mathematical model for predicting the frequencies of alleles in a population from one generation to the next, assuming certain conditions are met. These conditions include a large population size, random mating, no mutations, no migration, and no natural selection.

The Hardy-Weinberg law allows scientists to make predictions about how genetic traits are inherited and how they may change over time within a population. By understanding the frequencies of alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of genetic diversity and evolution. This law is particularly useful in studying traits that are influenced by a single gene locus with two alleles, such as blood type or certain genetic disorders.

In summary, the Hardy-Weinberg law is a fundamental principle in population genetics that helps scientists understand how gene frequencies can remain stable or change within populations over generations. By studying this law, researchers can gain valuable insights into genetic diversity, inheritance patterns, and evolutionary processes.
 2 148.55762 The law that states that the relative frequency of each gene allele tends to remain constant from generation to generation is known as the Hardy-Weinberg law. This principle describes the genetic equilibrium in a population under certain conditions. According to the Hardy-Weinberg law, the allele frequencies in a population will remain stable if certain assumptions are met. These assumptions include a large population size, random mating, no migration, no mutation, and no natural selection. When these conditions are satisfied, the law predicts that the gene pool of a population will remain constant over time, with no changes in allele frequencies. However, any deviation from these assumptions can lead to changes in the gene pool, resulting in genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, or natural selection. It is important to note that while the Hardy-Weinberg law provides a theoretical framework, real populations often do not perfectly conform to these assumptions.
 3 138.74219 The Hardy-Weinberg law, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, is a principle in population genetics that describes the distribution of alleles in a non-evolving population. It provides a mathematical model to estimate the frequency of different genotypes and alleles in a population. The law states that in the absence of certain factors, such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, migration, and non-random mating, the frequency of alleles in a population will remain constant from generation to generation. 

By excluding natural selection as an option, we understand that the Hardy Weinberg law indicates that the relative frequency of different alleles within a population will remain constant over time, as long as no other factors that influence gene frequencies are present. This equilibrium implies that the population is not evolving and serves as a useful null hypothesis for studying genetic variation in natural populations. However, in reality, natural selection is an important factor that can cause changes in allele frequencies, leading to evolution over time.

It is worth noting that the Hardy-Weinberg law assumes an idealized population with certain conditions, such as a large population size, random mating, absence of mutation, migration, and selection. In real-world populations, these assumptions may not hold true, and deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can indicate the presence of evolutionary forces at work. Therefore, the law serves as a valuable tool for studying populations and understanding how genetic variation can change over time.
 4 131.03418  The Hardy–Weinberg principle states that under certain idealised conditions, including the absence of selection pressures, a large population will have no change in the frequency of alleles as generations pass. A population that satisfies these conditions is said to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. In particular, Hardy and Weinberg showed that dominant and recessive alleles do not automatically tend to become more and less frequent respectively, as had been thought previously. The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include that there must be no mutations, immigration, or emigration, all of which can directly change allelic frequencies. Additionally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles. A population that is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is analogous to a deck of cards; no matter how many times the deck is shuffled, no new cards are added and no old ones are taken away. Cards in the deck represent alleles in a population's gene pool. In practice, no population can be in perfect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The population's finite size, combined with natural selection and many other effects, cause the allelic frequencies to change over time.
 5 125.65234 Factors that affect the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law include random mating, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and natural selection. Random mating refers to the idea that individuals in a population choose their mates without any bias towards specific traits. This ensures that all genotypes have an equal chance of being passed on to the next generation. 

Genetic drift, on the other hand, refers to the random changes in allele frequencies that can occur in small populations due to chance events. This can lead to deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 

Gene flow occurs when individuals migrate between different populations, introducing new alleles or removing existing ones. This can disrupt the equilibrium if the migrating individuals have different allele frequencies than the recipient population. 

Mutation is another factor that can alter allele frequencies. Mutations create new genetic variations, which can change the gene pool of a population and affect the equilibrium. 

Finally, natural selection is the process by which certain traits are favored or disfavored in a population. If certain genotypes have a higher fitness than others, they will be selected for and their frequencies will increase, disrupting the equilibrium. 

Overall, these factors can individually or collectively influence the equilibrium in Hardy-Weinberg's law, highlighting the dynamic nature of genetic populations.

['The Barr body is a heterochromatin structure found in the nuclei of female mammalian cells. It is formed by the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in females, which results in the condensation of the chromatin into a compact, inactive structure. This inactivation is known as X-chromosome inactivation or lyonization, and it occurs randomly in each cell during early embryonic development. The Barr body is named after the British embryologist, Dr. Murray Barr, who first described it in 1941.\n\nThe Barr body is typically visible as a dark, dense mass near the nucleolus, which is a structure within the nucleus that is involved in ribosome synthesis. The Barr body is composed of highly condensed chromatin, which is characterized by the presence of histone proteins and the absence of transcription factors. This condensed chromatin structure is resistant to transcription, which means that the genes on the inactive X chromosome are not being transcribed into RNA.\n\nThe formation of the Barr body is a complex process that involves the recruitment of various proteins and modifications to the chromatin. One of the key proteins involved in this process is the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), which is a long non-coding RNA molecule that is transcribed from the X-inactive', "The Barr body found within female mammalian cells' nuclei is an example ofThe Barr body found within female mammalian cells' nuclei is an example of\nA. euchromatin\nB. heterochromatin\nC. a cistron\nD. pseudogenes"]

  X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies. Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called

  of the X chromosome to be "doubled," or hyperactivated, to match the amount that females have with two X chromosomes. The second dosage compensation that occurs in mammals are the balancing of X’s and autosomes. This regulation occurs by the upregulation of Xa, which is the active X. The upregulation of the active X shows increases in the activation of transcription and elongation. The X chromosome, compared to an autosomal gene, contains more silent genes which influences measuring the amount of influence active genes have. RNA-seq data was preformed and the autosomal and X linked gene outputs were significantly different. This agrees with the fact that X dosage

In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the male-specific lethal (msl) gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The msl gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the msl gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the

  A major function of H-NS is to influence DNA topology (Figure 2). H-NS is responsible for formation of nucleofilaments along the DNA and DNA-DNA bridges. H-NS is known as a passive DNA bridger, meaning that it binds two distant segments of DNA and remains stationary, forming a loop. This DNA loop formation allows H-NS to control gene expression. Relief of suppression by H-NS can be achieved by the binding of another protein, or by changes in DNA topology which can occur due to changes in temperature and osmolarity, for example. The CTD binds to the bacterial in such a way that inhibits the function of RNA polymerase. This is a common feature seen in horizontally acquired genes. Structural studies of H-NS

 at some point prior to the onset of mitosis, the promoters of genes that exist in a transcription-competent state become "marked" in some way, ; this "mark" persists both during and after mitosis, and ; the marking transmits gene expression memory by preventing the mitotic compaction of DNA at this locus, or by facilitating reassembly of transcription complexes on the promoter, or both. Bookmarking (also "gene bookmarking" or "mitotic bookmarking") refers to a potential mechanism of transmission of gene expression programs through cell division. During mitosis, gene transcription is silenced and most transcription factors are removed from chromatin. The term bookmarking compares transcription to reading from a book. The pause in transcription during mitosis is like closing the book. "Molecular bookmarks" are the factors that allow transcription to resume in an orderly fashion in newborn cells following mitosis (when the book is re-opened). Bookmarks fulfill the following criteria:

  H-NS has a specific topology that allows it to condense bacterial DNA into a superhelical structure based on evidence from X-ray crystallography. The condensed superhelical structure has implicated H-NS in gene repression caused by the formation of oligomers. These oligomers form due to dimerization of two sites in the N-terminal domain of H-NS. For example, in bacterial species like Salmonella typhimurium, the NTD of H-NS contains dimerization sites in helices alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3. Alpha helices 3 and 4 are then responsible for creating the superhelical structure of H-NS-DNA interactions by head to head association (Figure 2). H-NS also contains an unstructured linker region, also known as a Q-linker. The C-Terminal domain, also known as the DNA Binding Domain (DBD), shows high affinity for regions in DNA that are rich in

 One epigenetic mechanism that contributes to the silencing of one X chromosome in females is DNA methylation. The inactive X chromosome is highly methylated, meaning that methyl groups are added to specific regions of the DNA. This methylation leads to gene silencing by preventing transcription factors and other regulatory proteins from accessing the DNA and initiating transcription. In addition to DNA methylation, another epigenetic mechanism involved in X chromosome inactivation is histone modification. Histones are proteins that help package and organize DNA within the nucleus. The inactive X chromosome has low levels of histone acetylation, which results in a more tightly packed chromatin structure that is less permissive to gene expression. Conversely, active X chromosomes have higher levels of histone acetylation, leading to a more open chromatin configuration that promotes transcription.

The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene plays a crucial role in X chromosome inactivation. It encodes a large noncoding RNA molecule called Xist RNA, which coats the X chromosome from which it is transcribed. This coating helps initiate and maintain the silencing of the X chromosome. Additionally, noncoding RNAs that bind to DNA can also impact transcriptional activity and contribute to the silencing process.

It is important to note that X chromosome inactivation occurs randomly in each cell during development, meaning that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome can be inactivated. Once a particular X chromosome is inactivated, it remains inactive and this information is passed on to future generations of cells.

Overall, these epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the involvement of Xist RNA, contribute to the silencing of one X chromosome in females as part of the X chromosome inactivation process.

[Reference: The inactive X chromosome is highly methylated and has low levels of histone acetylation. The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene encodes a large noncoding RNA that mediates the silencing of the X chromosome from which it is transcribed by coating it with Xist RNA. CpG islands in promoter regions are typically unmethylated, and the lack of methylation facilitates transcription. Histone methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to lysine residues in histone proteins. Acetylation of histone proteins results in an open chromatin configuration, which favors active transcription. Other histone modifications and noncoding RNAs also play roles in transcriptional regulation.]

 The form of RNA that is most likely to play a role in Barr body formation, which is an inactivated X chromosome, is long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNAs have been implicated in the process of X chromosome inactivation, which is responsible for the formation of Barr bodies. These noncoding RNA molecules are transcribed from the Xist gene on the X chromosome that will be inactivated.

During X chromosome inactivation, the Xist lncRNA coats the future inactive X chromosome and recruits proteins involved in gene silencing. This coating leads to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally inactive structure, known as the Barr body. The Xist lncRNA plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of X chromosome inactivation, ensuring gene dosage compensation between males and females.

By studying the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation and the involvement of lncRNAs like Xist, researchers have gained insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and the role of noncoding RNAs in developmental processes.

 F body refers to the Y chromatin, which is a characteristic feature of the interphase nuclei of normal cells in individuals with male chromosomal complement. It is named after the French cytologist, Alfred J. F. Fourtier, who first described this phenomenon. The F body represents the condensed, heterochromatic inactive portion of the Y chromosome. 

The Y chromosome is found in males and is responsible for male sexual development. It contains genes that code for the development of male characteristics and fertility. In interphase nuclei, the Y chromosome can appear as a dark, dense body called the F body or Barr body. This condensed form of the Y chromosome is inactive and has a different appearance compared to the active X chromosome found in females.

The formation of the F body is due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation, which balances the gene expression between males and females. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to achieve dosage compensation. This inactivation process results in the formation of the Barr body, which is analogous to the F body in males.

It is important to note that the F body is a term specific to the Y chromosome in males, whereas the Barr body is specific to the X chromosome in females. These structures play a role in regulating gene expression and preserving the stability of the genome.

  A pronucleus (plural: pronuclei) is the nucleus of a sperm or an egg cell during the process of fertilization. The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse. Contrary to the sperm cell, the egg cell has a pronucleus once it becomes haploid, and not when the sperm cell arrives. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells, so in humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes, while somatic cells have 46 chromosomes. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead,

 1 84.81787 F body refers to the Y chromatin, which is a characteristic feature of the interphase nuclei of normal cells in individuals with male chromosomal complement. It is named after the French cytologist, Alfred J. F. Fourtier, who first described this phenomenon. The F body represents the condensed, heterochromatic inactive portion of the Y chromosome. 

The Y chromosome is found in males and is responsible for male sexual development. It contains genes that code for the development of male characteristics and fertility. In interphase nuclei, the Y chromosome can appear as a dark, dense body called the F body or Barr body. This condensed form of the Y chromosome is inactive and has a different appearance compared to the active X chromosome found in females.

The formation of the F body is due to the process of X-chromosome inactivation, which balances the gene expression between males and females. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to achieve dosage compensation. This inactivation process results in the formation of the Barr body, which is analogous to the F body in males.

It is important to note that the F body is a term specific to the Y chromosome in males, whereas the Barr body is specific to the X chromosome in females. These structures play a role in regulating gene expression and preserving the stability of the genome.
 2 54.39062 The form of RNA that is most likely to play a role in Barr body formation, which is an inactivated X chromosome, is long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNAs have been implicated in the process of X chromosome inactivation, which is responsible for the formation of Barr bodies. These noncoding RNA molecules are transcribed from the Xist gene on the X chromosome that will be inactivated.

During X chromosome inactivation, the Xist lncRNA coats the future inactive X chromosome and recruits proteins involved in gene silencing. This coating leads to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally inactive structure, known as the Barr body. The Xist lncRNA plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of X chromosome inactivation, ensuring gene dosage compensation between males and females.

By studying the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation and the involvement of lncRNAs like Xist, researchers have gained insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and the role of noncoding RNAs in developmental processes.

In females, the sex-lethal protein inhibits the male-specific lethal (msl) gene complex that would normally activate X-linked genes that result in an increase in the male transcription rate. The msl gene complex was named due to the loss-of-function mutant that results in the improper increase in the male transcription rate that results in the death of males. In males, the absence of the necessary amount of sex-lethal allows for the increase in the male transcription rate due to the msl gene complex no longer being inhibited. This allows the 
 5 19.01562  X hyperactivation refers to the process in Drosophila by which genes on the X chromosome in male flies become twice as active as genes on the X chromosome in female flies. Because male flies have a single X chromosome and female flies have two X chromosomes, the higher level of activation in males ensures that X chromosome genes are overall expressed at the same level in males and females. X hyperactivation is one mechanism of dosage compensation, whereby organisms that use genetic sex determination systems balance the gene dosage from the sex chromosomes between males and females. X hyperactivation is regulated by the alternative splicing of a gene called

["Carbon is a crucial element in the Earth's atmosphere, and its concentration has been steadily increasing over the past century due to human activities. The primary source of atmospheric carbon is the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air. This process is known as anthropogenic carbon emissions, and it is the leading cause of global warming.\n\nHowever, there are other sources of atmospheric carbon as well. Respiration, for example, is a natural process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is because when we breathe, we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Similarly, photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide into organic matter, also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nBacterial decomposition is another natural process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This occurs when organic matter, such as dead plants and animals, is broken down by bacteria. The process of bacterial decomposition releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nIn contrast, bacterial decomposition is not a significant source of atmospheric carbon. This is because the amount of carbon released through bacterial decomposition is relatively small compared to the amount released through other processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while respiration, photosynthesis, and bacterial decomposition", 'Which of the following is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon?Which of the following is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon?\nA.

  the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for. Natural processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 29% of annual global emissions. The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted.

  The Earth absorbs sunlight, then radiates it as heat. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit infrared radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence. While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as (~20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore

Additional emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the  released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser. Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of inorganic and organic fertiliser. From a production standpoint, the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%).

  Aerosols are one of the most important contributors to climate change in the atmosphere. Many of the particles suspended in the atmosphere originate from a multitude of sources. Some of these sources are natural and some of them are man-made. Most aerosols reflect sunlight, and some also absorb it. A lot of these nanoparticles cause severe health effects in addition to climate effects. There are many human activities that produce these particles. Black carbon particles (a component of soot) originating from combustion processes have been known for some time to absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere, and pollution controls have been put into place to reduce their emissions and their effects. Brown carbon has attracted interest as a possible cause of climate change. This class of organic carbon, known for its brownish color, absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet wavelengths and less significantly going into the visible wavelengths. Types of brown carbon include tar materials from smoldering fires or coal combustion, breakdown products from biomass burning, a mixture of organic compounds emitted from soil, and volatile organic compounds given off by vegetation.

  Carbon rift is a result of CO2 gas being released into the environment by human sources, with the theory focusing specifically on capitalistic ones. In 2014, fossil fuel consumption resulted in nearly 36 billion metric tons of CO2 finding its way into natural sinks such as the atmosphere, land, and oceans. This transfer of carbon from the burning of fossil fuels into the biosphere is the primary human-driven cause of greenhouse gas emissions and is closely related to the unchecked behavior of capitalism.

  Petroleum extraction disrupts the equilibrium of earth's carbon cycle by transporting sequestered geologic carbon into the biosphere. The carbon is used by consumers in various forms and a large fraction is combusted into the atmosphere; thus creating massive amounts of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as a waste product. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. Since the industrial age began circa 1750–1850 with growing wood and coal use, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane have increased about 50% and 150%, respectively, above their relatively stable levels of the prior 800,000+ years. Each is currently increasing at a rate of about 1% every year, since about half of the added carbon has been absorbed by Earth's land vegetation and ocean sinks. The growth in annual emissions has also been so rapid that the total amount of fossil carbon extracted in the last 30 years exceeds the total amount extracted during all prior human history.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35% during the Carboniferous period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen and the breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.

 The sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include various natural and human activities. One major source is the respiration of all animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. During respiration, these organisms produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Additionally, plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create sugars, which can be used for plant growth or consumed again in respiration.

Another significant source of carbon dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels and vegetable matter. When these substances are burned, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This includes activities such as burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production or transportation.

Inorganic carbon dioxide is also emitted by geothermal processes like volcanoes and hot springs. These natural occurrences release carbon dioxide from within the Earth's crust.

It's important to note that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its ability to absorb infrared radiation makes it an important component in regulating Earth's temperature.

Overall, the sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include both natural processes like respiration and volcanic activity, as well as human activities such as burning fossil fuels. These sources contribute to the overall concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

 The greatest contributor to global warming as a consequence of human activities and lifestyle is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that occurs naturally in the Earth's atmosphere, but human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have significantly increased its concentration. Carbon dioxide acts as a blanket in the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon is one of the primary causes of global warming.

Burning fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production and transportation is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. These activities release vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, contributing to the overall greenhouse gas concentration. Deforestation also plays a significant role in carbon dioxide emissions. Trees and plants absorb CO2 as part of the natural carbon cycle, but when forests are cleared or burned, stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere.

Moreover, industrial processes such as cement production, chemical manufacturing, and the extraction of metals also release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For example, cement production emits CO2 both from the combustion of fossil fuels and from chemical reactions during the manufacturing process.

Reducing carbon dioxide emissions is crucial in mitigating the effects of global warming. Implementing sustainable practices, transitioning to renewable sources of energy, and promoting reforestation efforts are important steps that can help lessen our carbon footprint and work towards a more sustainable future.

 1 71.95312 The sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include various natural and human activities. One major source is the respiration of all animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. During respiration, these organisms produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Additionally, plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create sugars, which can be used for plant growth or consumed again in respiration.

Another significant source of carbon dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels and vegetable matter. When these substances are burned, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This includes activities such as burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production or transportation.

Inorganic carbon dioxide is also emitted by geothermal processes like volcanoes and hot springs. These natural occurrences release carbon dioxide from within the Earth's crust.

It's important to note that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its ability to absorb infrared radiation makes it an important component in regulating Earth's temperature.

Overall, the sources of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere include both natural processes like respiration and volcanic activity, as well as human activities such as burning fossil fuels. These sources contribute to the overall concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
 2 47.55078  Carbon rift is a result of CO2 gas being released into the environment by human sources, with the theory focusing specifically on capitalistic ones. In 2014, fossil fuel consumption resulted in nearly 36 billion metric tons of CO2 finding its way into natural sinks such as the atmosphere, land, and oceans. This transfer of carbon from the burning of fossil fuels into the biosphere is the primary human-driven cause of greenhouse gas emissions and is closely related to the unchecked behavior of capitalism.
 3 45.51172  Petroleum extraction disrupts the equilibrium of earth's carbon cycle by transporting sequestered geologic carbon into the biosphere. The carbon is used by consumers in various forms and a large fraction is combusted into the atmosphere; thus creating massive amounts of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as a waste product. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. Since the industrial age began circa 1750–1850 with growing wood and coal use, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane have increased about 50% and 150%, respectively, above their relatively stable levels of the prior 800,000+ years. Each is currently increasing at a rate of about 1% every year, since about half of the added carbon has been absorbed by Earth's land vegetation and ocean sinks. The growth in annual emissions has also been so rapid that the total amount of fossil carbon extracted in the last 30 years exceeds the total amount extracted during all prior human history.
 4 44.16406  oxide, and 3% was fluorinated gases. emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity. Additional emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the  released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser. Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of inorganic and organic fertiliser. From a production standpoint, the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%). 
 5 39.89258  the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for. Natural processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 29% of annual global emissions. The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted.

['Punctuated equilibrium is a theory in evolutionary biology that proposes that most species evolve relatively rapidly through periods of rapid change, or "punctuations," separated by long periods of relative stasis, or "equilibrium." This theory challenges the traditional Darwinian view of gradualism, which suggests that evolution occurs through small, incremental changes over long periods of time.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibrium was first proposed by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in the 1970s. They argued that the fossil record shows evidence of sudden, dramatic changes in species, followed by long periods of relative stability. These sudden changes, or "punctuations," are thought to be caused by environmental factors, such as catastrophic events or changes in climate.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibrium has been supported by a number of studies, particularly in the field of paleontology. For example, a study of fossils from the Burgess Shale in Canada found that many species appeared suddenly in the fossil record, followed by long periods of relative stasis.\n\nHowever, the theory has also been criticized by some scientists, who argue that it is not supported by all lines of evidence. For example, some studies have found evidence of gradual evolution in certain species, rather than sudden, dramatic changes.\n\nOverall, the theory of punctuated equilibrium remains a topic of debate and ongoing research in the', 'The concept of punctuated equilibrium refers toThe concept of punctuated equilibrium refers to\nA. oscillating ecological successional stages\nB. ecological succession arrested by sudden environmental changes, e.g., fire\nC. persistent predator-prey relationships in relatively stable environments\nD. bursts of speciation followed by relatively unchanging lineages']

  species. The theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over

 Punctuated gradualism is a hypothesis in the field of microevolution that describes a pattern of evolution where a species experiences long periods of relative stability, or stasis, followed by shorter periods of rapid morphological change. This model suggests that evolutionary changes occur in bursts rather than as a constant and gradual process.

In punctuated gradualism, species exhibit little to no change over extended periods of time, which is known as stasis. However, during certain intervals, relatively rapid morphological changes occur without leading to the formation of new lineages or branching. These bursts of change are often associated with environmental pressures or other factors that drive adaptation within a population.

This model differs from other models of evolution, such as phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. Phyletic gradualism proposes that evolutionary change occurs gradually and continuously over long periods, resulting in the transformation of one species into another. In contrast, punctuated gradualism suggests that most evolutionary change happens during short bursts rather than being continuous.

Punctuated equilibrium, on the other hand, also acknowledges periods of stasis but emphasizes that speciation events can occur relatively rapidly after prolonged stability. Punctuated equilibrium proposes that species remain relatively unchanged for extended periods and then experience sudden bursts of rapid evolution leading to the formation of new lineages.

Overall, punctuated gradualism highlights the idea that evolution can involve long periods of stability interrupted by episodes of rapid morphological change within existing lineages. It provides an alternative perspective to phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium in understanding patterns and rates of evolutionary change.

  Darwin and his contemporaries viewed evolution as a slow and gradual process. Evolutionary trees are based on the idea that profound differences in species are the result of many small changes that accumulate over long periods. Gradualism had its basis in the works of the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell. Hutton's view suggests that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to catastrophism which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s palaeontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years) alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called punctuated equilibrium and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.

In the vernacular, "theory" can refer to guesswork, a simple conjecture, an opinion, or a speculation that does not have to be based on facts and need not be framed for making testable predictions. In science, however, the meaning of theory is more rigorous. A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses." Theories are formed from

 Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."Darwin thought that the lack of fossil evidence for gradualism was due to the low likelihood that the intermediate steps in such transitions would have been preserved. **Figure 19.2** Origins of vertebrate physiologic homologies. Sterols ( _far left_ ) under the control of hypoxia inhibitory factor‐1 (HIF‐1) link prokaryotes and eukaryotes together functionally; thus the major vertebrate physiologic homologies are linked through the induction of endothermy (top solid arrow) by atmospheric oxygen (bottom solid arrow). In the center of the schematic is the molecular regulation of alveolar surfactant production. It is homologous with brain (neuregulin, Nrg) and skin (tubular myelin, tm), both of which are under parathyroid hormone‐related protein (PTHrP) regulation. Lung and bone share functional homology through PTHrP stretch‐regulated metabolism. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leptin, adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) and β‐adrenergic receptor (βAR) share homologies with the fat pad free fatty acid (FFA) regulation. The lung and kidney share functional homologies through PTHrP and type IV collagen ("Goodpasture"). Periods of hypoxia due to shortfalls in the saltatory process of lung evolution caused physiologic stress, stimulating the pituitary‐adrenal axis production of adrenaline (epinephrine), which both relieved the constraint on the alveoli stimulating surfactant secretion, and stimulated peripheral fat cell secretion of FFAs, causing increased metabolic activity and body heat = endothermy. Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."This slow pace is "punctuated" by rapid bursts of change resulting in new species.According to this theory, changes leading to new species do not result from slow, incremental changes in the mainstream population.Instead, changes occur in populations living on the periphery, or in isolated populations where their gene pools vary more widely due to slightly different environmental conditions.

  Many scientists and philosophers of science have described evolution as fact and theory, a phrase which was used as the title of an article by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in 1981. He describes fact in science as meaning data, not known with absolute certainty but "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent". A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of evolution come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical common descent, and from transitions in the fossil record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts. Each of the words evolution, fact and theory has several meanings in different contexts. In biology, evolution refers to observed changes in organisms over successive generations, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in gene

 The main differences between the traditional phylogenetic model of paleontology and the punctuated equilibrium model lie in their views on the pace and nature of evolution. The phylogenetic model suggests that features evolve slowly over time without any direct association with speciation events. This means that changes in species occur gradually and continuously.

On the other hand, the punctuated equilibrium model proposes that major evolutionary changes do not happen gradually but rather in localized, rare, and rapid events of branching speciation. According to this model, species remain relatively stable for long periods of time (equilibrium), with little change occurring. However, when change does occur, it happens rapidly and results in new branches or species forming.

Punctuated gradualism is a variation within this framework, lying somewhere between the phyletic gradualism model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It suggests that lineages can undergo rapid transitions between long-stable states without necessarily requiring speciation events. In other words, significant evolutionary changes can occur without the formation of new species.

It's important to note that while these models provide different perspectives on how evolution occurs, they are not mutually exclusive. They represent different ways of understanding patterns of evolutionary change over time.

  In ecology, the theory of alternative stable states (sometimes termed alternate stable states or alternative stable equilibria) predicts that ecosystems can exist under multiple "states" (sets of unique biotic and abiotic conditions). These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a phase shift or regime shift), when perturbed. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. Alternative stable state theory suggests that discrete states are separated by ecological thresholds, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an environmental gradient.

  split into two or more reproductively isolated groups and these groups accumulate sufficient differences to become distinct species. The punctuated equilibria hypothesis suggests that anagenesis is rare and that the rate of evolution is most rapid immediately after a split which will lead to cladogenesis, but does not completely rule out anagenesis. Distinguishing between anagenesis and cladogenesis is particularly relevant in the fossil record, where limited fossil preservation in time and space makes it difficult to distinguish between anagenesis, cladogenesis where one species replaces the other, or simple migration patterns. Recent evolutionary studies are looking at anagenesis and cladogeneis for possible answers in developing the hominin phylogenetic tree

  In the natural sciences, gradualism is the theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with catastrophism. The theory was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton, a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into Charles Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism. Tenets from both theories were applied to biology and formed the basis of early evolutionary theory. Charles Darwin was influenced by Lyell's Principles of Geology, which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see catastrophism), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in saltations, since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against. Gradualism is often confused with the concept of phyletic gradualism. It is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium, which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.

 1 70.89648 The main differences between the traditional phylogenetic model of paleontology and the punctuated equilibrium model lie in their views on the pace and nature of evolution. The phylogenetic model suggests that features evolve slowly over time without any direct association with speciation events. This means that changes in species occur gradually and continuously.

On the other hand, the punctuated equilibrium model proposes that major evolutionary changes do not happen gradually but rather in localized, rare, and rapid events of branching speciation. According to this model, species remain relatively stable for long periods of time (equilibrium), with little change occurring. However, when change does occur, it happens rapidly and results in new branches or species forming.

Punctuated gradualism is a variation within this framework, lying somewhere between the phyletic gradualism model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It suggests that lineages can undergo rapid transitions between long-stable states without necessarily requiring speciation events. In other words, significant evolutionary changes can occur without the formation of new species.

It's important to note that while these models provide different perspectives on how evolution occurs, they are not mutually exclusive. They represent different ways of understanding patterns of evolutionary change over time.

 2 65.21777 Punctuated gradualism is a hypothesis in the field of microevolution that describes a pattern of evolution where a species experiences long periods of relative stability, or stasis, followed by shorter periods of rapid morphological change. This model suggests that evolutionary changes occur in bursts rather than as a constant and gradual process.

In punctuated gradualism, species exhibit little to no change over extended periods of time, which is known as stasis. However, during certain intervals, relatively rapid morphological changes occur without leading to the formation of new lineages or branching. These bursts of change are often associated with environmental pressures or other factors that drive adaptation within a population.

This model differs from other models of evolution, such as phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. Phyletic gradualism proposes that evolutionary change occurs gradually and continuously over long periods, resulting in the transformation of one species into another. In contrast, punctuated gradualism suggests that most evolutionary change happens during short bursts rather than being continuous.

Punctuated equilibrium, on the other hand, also acknowledges periods of stasis but emphasizes that speciation events can occur relatively rapidly after prolonged stability. Punctuated equilibrium proposes that species remain relatively unchanged for extended periods and then experience sudden bursts of rapid evolution leading to the formation of new lineages.

Overall, punctuated gradualism highlights the idea that evolution can involve long periods of stability interrupted by episodes of rapid morphological change within existing lineages. It provides an alternative perspective to phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium in understanding patterns and rates of evolutionary change.

 3 52.80664  In ecology, the theory of alternative stable states (sometimes termed alternate stable states or alternative stable equilibria) predicts that ecosystems can exist under multiple "states" (sets of unique biotic and abiotic conditions). These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a phase shift or regime shift), when perturbed. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. Alternative stable state theory suggests that discrete states are separated by ecological thresholds, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an environmental gradient.

This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 
 5 35.65625 Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."Darwin thought that the lack of fossil evidence for gradualism was due to the low likelihood that the intermediate steps in such transitions would have been preserved. **Figure 19.2** Origins of vertebrate physiologic homologies. Sterols ( _far left_ ) under the control of hypoxia inhibitory factor‐1 (HIF‐1) link prokaryotes and eukaryotes together functionally; thus the major vertebrate physiologic homologies are linked through the induction of endothermy (top solid arrow) by atmospheric oxygen (bottom solid arrow). In the center of the schematic is the molecular regulation of alveolar surfactant production. It is homologous with brain (neuregulin, Nrg) and skin (tubular myelin, tm), both of which are under parathyroid hormone‐related protein (PTHrP) regulation. Lung and bone share functional homology through PTHrP stretch‐regulated metabolism. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leptin, adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) and β‐adrenergic receptor (βAR) share homologies with the fat pad free fatty acid (FFA) regulation. The lung and kidney share functional homologies through PTHrP and type IV collagen ("Goodpasture"). Periods of hypoxia due to shortfalls in the saltatory process of lung evolution caused physiologic stress, stimulating the pituitary‐adrenal axis production of adrenaline (epinephrine), which both relieved the constraint on the alveoli stimulating surfactant secretion, and stimulated peripheral fat cell secretion of FFAs, causing increased metabolic activity and body heat = endothermy. Then, in 1972 evolutionary biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge suggested that the "missing links" in the fossil record were real, representing periods of stasis in morphology, calling this mode of evolution "punctuated equilibrium."This slow pace is "punctuated" by rapid bursts of change resulting in new species.According to this theory, changes leading to new species do not result from slow, incremental changes in the mainstream population.Instead, changes occur in populations living on the periphery, or in isolated populations where their gene pools vary more widely due to slightly different environmental conditions.

  Influenza A is involved in most strains of the flu. It is an enveloped RNA virus. It has a protein membrane containing the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which are used by the virus to enter a host cell and to release itself and its copies from the host cell. Each strain of the influenza virus has a different pattern of glycoproteins; the glycoproteins themselves have variability as well.

  both humans and birds, so they may act as a "mixing vessel" in which reassortment can occur between flu viruses of several species. Reassortment is a process that happens if two different types of influenza virus infect a single cell and it can produce a new strain of influenza. This is because the virus genome is split between eight independent pieces of RNA, which allows pieces of RNA from different viruses to mix and form a novel type of virus as new virus particles are being assembled. This new strain appears to be a result of the reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, one from North America and one from Europe. But the North

  Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by transfection. This is often performed to cause cells to express a gene of interest. More recently, the transfection of RNAi constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as transduction, infection or transformation. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

  There are two ways viruses can enter the host cell: cell receptor endocytosis or fusion. Endocytosis is the process where the virus binds a receptor on the target cell membrane, and the virus is taken into or endocytosed into the cell. Endocytosis can either be pH independent or pH dependent. Fusion occurs when the virus fuses together with the target cell membrane and releases its genome into the cell. RSV enters the host cell through fusion of the host cell membrane.

The capsid of some viruses are enclosed in a membrane called the viral envelope. In most cases, the viral envelope is obtained by the capsid from the host cell's plasma membrane when a virus leaves its host cell through a process called budding. The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer embedded with viral proteins, including viral glycoproteins. These viral glycoproteins bind to specific receptors and coreceptors on the membrane of host cells, and they allow viruses to attach onto their target host cells. Some of these glycoproteins include: Viral glycoproteins play a critical role in virus-to-cell fusion. Virus-to-cell fusion is initiated when viral glycoproteins bind to cellular receptors.

 Viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the cellular machinery of the host. They are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on the host cell's ability to replicate genetic information and synthesize proteins.

When a virus infects a host cell, it delivers its genetic material (DNA or RNA) into the host cell's cytoplasm. The viral genetic material then takes control of the host cell's protein synthesis machinery, redirecting it to produce viral proteins instead of the cell's own proteins.

The viral genetic material is also replicated within the host cell. For DNA viruses, the viral DNA is replicated using the host cell's DNA replication machinery. For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is usually first converted into DNA using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (in the case of retroviruses) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (in the case of RNA viruses). This viral DNA (or RNA in the case of RNA viruses) is then replicated using the host cell's replication machinery.

Once the viral genetic material has been replicated, the newly synthesized viral proteins and nucleic acids assemble to form new virus particles. These virus particles then leave the host cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by causing the cell to rupture (lysis), allowing the released viruses to infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of infection.

In summary, viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the host cell's machinery for protein synthesis and genetic replication. This allows them to produce new viral particles, which can then infect other cells.

 In the replication cycle of the virus causing the symptoms in the patient, a crucial step known as reverse transcription occurs, where viral RNA is converted into DNA. This process is carried out by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is unique to retroviruses. Reverse transcription is a vital step because it allows the virus to integrate into the host's genetic material and manipulate the host cell's machinery to produce more copies of the virus.

Once the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, it forms a structure known as a provirus. The provirus can be integrated into the host cell's genome, allowing it to be passed on to future generations of cells. This integration is facilitated by another enzyme called integrase. By incorporating its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, the virus ensures its long-term survival and persistence within the host's body.

After integration, the host cell's machinery starts producing viral proteins and genetic material using the viral DNA. These components assemble to form new viral particles. Eventually, the newly synthesized viruses are released from the infected cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by the host cell rupturing (lysis). These released viruses can then go on to infect other cells and continue the replication cycle.

It's important to note that different viruses may have varying replication cycles and strategies. The one described here is specific to retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which utilize reverse transcription to convert their RNA into DNA. By understanding the intricacies of the replication cycle, researchers can develop targeted approaches for antiviral therapies to disrupt key steps and impede viral replication.

Please keep in mind that professional medical advice and proper diagnostic procedures are necessary for accurate evaluation and treatment of specific medical conditions. I encourage you to consult a healthcare professional for personalized assistance.

  Viral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the rolling-hairpin model.

  Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. They encode a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for this process. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Reverse transcriptase has been widely used as an experimental tool for the analysis of RNA molecules in the laboratory, in particular the conversion of RNA molecules into DNA prior to molecular cloning and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

 In the replication of a virus, there are two main components involved: the virus itself and the host cell. The virus provides the genetic code necessary for replication, while the host cell provides the energy and raw materials required for the process.

A virus is composed of a core of genetic material, either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid), surrounded by a protein coat called an antigenic protein. Some viruses may also have an additional envelope made of lipoprotein. The genetic material of the virus contains all the information needed to make copies of itself.

When a virus infects a host cell, it injects its genetic material into the cell. The genetic material then hijacks the cellular machinery of the host cell to replicate itself. The replication process varies depending on whether the virus has DNA or RNA as its genetic material.

In the case of DNA viruses, the viral DNA becomes integrated into the host cell's DNA, and it uses the host cell's enzymes and resources to replicate its DNA. The host cell's machinery reads the viral DNA and produces new viral DNA strands, which are then packaged into new virus particles.

For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is used directly as a template for the synthesis of new viral RNA strands. The host cell's enzymes and resources are utilized to produce new viral proteins using the viral RNA as a blueprint. These proteins are then assembled with the new viral RNA strands to form new virus particles.

Throughout the replication process, the host cell plays a crucial role by providing the necessary energy and raw materials. The host cell supplies the energy required for cellular processes and provides the building blocks, such as nucleotides and amino acids, for the synthesis of new viral genetic material and proteins. Without the host cell's resources, the virus would not be able to replicate and continue its infectious cycle.

Overall, the replication of a virus involves the virus using the host cell's machinery and resources to generate new viral genetic material and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles. The host cell's role is vital in providing the necessary components for viral replication to occur.

 1 167.01172 Viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the cellular machinery of the host. They are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on the host cell's ability to replicate genetic information and synthesize proteins.

When a virus infects a host cell, it delivers its genetic material (DNA or RNA) into the host cell's cytoplasm. The viral genetic material then takes control of the host cell's protein synthesis machinery, redirecting it to produce viral proteins instead of the cell's own proteins.

The viral genetic material is also replicated within the host cell. For DNA viruses, the viral DNA is replicated using the host cell's DNA replication machinery. For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is usually first converted into DNA using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (in the case of retroviruses) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (in the case of RNA viruses). This viral DNA (or RNA in the case of RNA viruses) is then replicated using the host cell's replication machinery.

Once the viral genetic material has been replicated, the newly synthesized viral proteins and nucleic acids assemble to form new virus particles. These virus particles then leave the host cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by causing the cell to rupture (lysis), allowing the released viruses to infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of infection.

In summary, viruses replicate and reproduce within host cells by hijacking the host cell's machinery for protein synthesis and genetic replication. This allows them to produce new viral particles, which can then infect other cells.
 2 157.37860 In the replication cycle of the virus causing the symptoms in the patient, a crucial step known as reverse transcription occurs, where viral RNA is converted into DNA. This process is carried out by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is unique to retroviruses. Reverse transcription is a vital step because it allows the virus to integrate into the host's genetic material and manipulate the host cell's machinery to produce more copies of the virus.

Once the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, it forms a structure known as a provirus. The provirus can be integrated into the host cell's genome, allowing it to be passed on to future generations of cells. This integration is facilitated by another enzyme called integrase. By incorporating its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, the virus ensures its long-term survival and persistence within the host's body.

After integration, the host cell's machinery starts producing viral proteins and genetic material using the viral DNA. These components assemble to form new viral particles. Eventually, the newly synthesized viruses are released from the infected cell, either by budding from the cell membrane or by the host cell rupturing (lysis). These released viruses can then go on to infect other cells and continue the replication cycle.

It's important to note that different viruses may have varying replication cycles and strategies. The one described here is specific to retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which utilize reverse transcription to convert their RNA into DNA. By understanding the intricacies of the replication cycle, researchers can develop targeted approaches for antiviral therapies to disrupt key steps and impede viral replication.

Please keep in mind that professional medical advice and proper diagnostic procedures are necessary for accurate evaluation and treatment of specific medical conditions. I encourage you to consult a healthcare professional for personalized assistance.
 3 152.91504  Viral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the rolling-hairpin model. Dna templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export. Primates serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are oral and respiratory.
 4 135.06641 In the replication of a virus, there are two main components involved: the virus itself and the host cell. The virus provides the genetic code necessary for replication, while the host cell provides the energy and raw materials required for the process.

A virus is composed of a core of genetic material, either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid), surrounded by a protein coat called an antigenic protein. Some viruses may also have an additional envelope made of lipoprotein. The genetic material of the virus contains all the information needed to make copies of itself.

When a virus infects a host cell, it injects its genetic material into the cell. The genetic material then hijacks the cellular machinery of the host cell to replicate itself. The replication process varies depending on whether the virus has DNA or RNA as its genetic material.

In the case of DNA viruses, the viral DNA becomes integrated into the host cell's DNA, and it uses the host cell's enzymes and resources to replicate its DNA. The host cell's machinery reads the viral DNA and produces new viral DNA strands, which are then packaged into new virus particles.

For RNA viruses, the viral RNA is used directly as a template for the synthesis of new viral RNA strands. The host cell's enzymes and resources are utilized to produce new viral proteins using the viral RNA as a blueprint. These proteins are then assembled with the new viral RNA strands to form new virus particles.

Throughout the replication process, the host cell plays a crucial role by providing the necessary energy and raw materials. The host cell supplies the energy required for cellular processes and provides the building blocks, such as nucleotides and amino acids, for the synthesis of new viral genetic material and proteins. Without the host cell's resources, the virus would not be able to replicate and continue its infectious cycle.

Overall, the replication of a virus involves the virus using the host cell's machinery and resources to generate new viral genetic material and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles. The host cell's role is vital in providing the necessary components for viral replication to occur.

The capsid of some viruses are enclosed in a membrane called the viral envelope. In most cases, the viral envelope is obtained by the capsid from the host cell's plasma membrane when a virus leaves its host cell through a process called budding. The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer embedded with viral proteins, including viral glycoproteins. These viral glycoproteins bind to specific receptors and coreceptors on the membrane of host cells, and they allow viruses to attach onto their target host cells. Some of these glycoproteins include: Viral glycoproteins play a critical role in virus-to-cell fusion. Virus-to-cell fusion is initiated when viral glycoproteins bind to cellular receptors.

['During the early stages of embryonic development, the process of cell division is critical in determining the overall shape and structure of the organism. In some organisms, the cleavage pattern, or the way in which the cells divide, is symmetrical and follows a specific pattern. This type of cleavage is known as radial cleavage.\n\nRadial cleavage occurs when the first few cell divisions occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis, resulting in a symmetrical pattern of cell division. This type of cleavage is common in animals with bilateral symmetry, such as vertebrates.\n\nIn radial cleavage, the blastula, or the ball of cells that forms during early development, is flattened and disc-shaped. The cells divide in a radial pattern, with each new cell forming a ring around the existing cells. This results in a series of concentric rings, or blastomeres, that surround a central cavity.\n\nThe blastomeres in radial cleavage are not equal in size, as they are in other types of cleavage. The cells in the center of the blastula are smaller than those on the periphery, and the cells in the outermost ring are the largest. This is due to the fact that the cells in the center of the blastula are surrounded by more cells, while the cells on the periphery are surrounded by fewer cells.\n\nRad', 'Cleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis is known asCleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis is known as\nA. meroblastic cleavage\nB. radial cleavage\nC. spiral cleavage\nD. superficial cleavage']

  univalents in both sexes remain between the segregating half-bivalents and form their own third nucleus, which is included in one of the two daughter cells. In female meiosis, this is the daughter cell facing the micropyle. Thus, in agreement with the two plant species discussed previously, the univalents are allocated directionally to the micropylar side. However, since here the embryo sac is formed at the other end of the tetrad facing the chalaza, this results in the elimination of the univalents from the inheritance. The compensation for this is done by the pollen, in that apparently only those pollen grains which arise from the dinucleate meiocytes and are therefore diploid, develop normally and become fertile.

When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the G1 stage of cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome. Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles. At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their

  In the life cycle of Elysia chlorotica, cleavage is holoblastic and spiral. This means that the eggs cleave completely (holoblastic); and each cleavage plane is at an oblique angle to the animal-vegetal axis of the egg. The result of this is that tiers of cells are produced, each tier lying in the furrows between cells of the tier below it. At the end of cleavage, the embryo forms a stereoblastula, meaning a blastula without a clear central cavity.

 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

 1 123.54688  In the life cycle of Elysia chlorotica, cleavage is holoblastic and spiral. This means that the eggs cleave completely (holoblastic); and each cleavage plane is at an oblique angle to the animal-vegetal axis of the egg. The result of this is that tiers of cells are produced, each tier lying in the furrows between cells of the tier below it. At the end of cleavage, the embryo forms a stereoblastula, meaning a blastula without a clear central cavity.
 2 110.95117 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

Developmental biology
 4 110.95117 In developmental biology, cleavage is the division of cells in the early embryo, following fertilization. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.

Depending mostly on the concentration of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.

Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.

Mechanism 

The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis.

The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus.

The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).

Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes.  It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.

Indeterminate 

A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.

Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.  In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging.  In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms.

Bilateral
 The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves.  The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another.  In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected.

Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte.

Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.

 Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed).  Because the cells have only a small concentration of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients.

 The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage.

Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below).  This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern.

 Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage.

 In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere.  Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates.

 In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere.

Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage.  Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial.

 Discoidal
 In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk.  The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk.  Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end).  The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the "syncytial layer".

 Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell.  With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells.  Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell).  This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.

Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals.

Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational.

At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover.

Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6). Types of cleavage

Determinate 

Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes. It is characteristic of deuterostomes – when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism. Holoblastic 

In holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so the number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage. In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small, even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate concentration of yolk in a gradient) – bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms. In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected. Radial
 Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte. Rotational
 Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially. Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed). The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage. Spiral
 Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere. In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four-cell stage during unequal cleavage. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. Meroblastic 

In the presence of a large concentration of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage. Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial. Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end). Superficial
 In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell. With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells. Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell). Placentals 

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation.
