The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" authors for \"fine powder.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum\". Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. It originated, as we learn from the Landmark, with a man named Turner, a member of the Preston Temperance Society, who, having an impediment of speech, in addressing a meeting remarked, that partial abstinence from intoxicating liquors would not do; they must insist upon tee-tee-(stammering) tee total abstinence. The word originated in the British Isles as a result of excise laws, but only became meaningful in the United States after a tax passed during the Civil War outlawing non-registered stills.

        "context": " The word \"alcohol\" is from the Arabic kohl (الكحل), a powder used as an eyeliner. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" authors for \"fine powder.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum\". Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. It originated, as we learn from the Landmark, with a man named Turner, a member of the Preston Temperance Society, who, having an impediment of speech, in addressing a meeting remarked, that partial abstinence from intoxicating liquors would not do; they must insist upon tee-tee-(stammering) tee total abstinence. The word originated in the British Isles as a result of excise laws, but only became meaningful in the United States after a tax passed during the Civil War outlawing non-registered stills.

They join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. In Nature, the process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is an RNA copy of one of the organism's genes. Folding of many proteins begins even during translation of the polypeptide chain. Failure to fold into native structure generally produces inactive proteins, but \n\n A cell membrane defines a boundary between a cell and its environment. In this model, the cell membrane surface is modeled as a two-dimensional fluid-like lipid bilayer where the lipid molecules can move freely. The proteins are partially or fully embedded in the lipid bilayer. The membrane skeleton is a network of proteins below the bilayer that links with the proteins in the lipid membrane. Protein folding is the physical process by which a protein chain is translated to its native three-dimensional structure, typically a \"folded\" conformation by which the protein becomes biologically functional. Via an expeditious and reproducible process, a polypeptide folds into its characteristic three-dimensional structure from a random coil.

They join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. In Nature, the process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is an RNA copy of one of the organism's genes. Folding of many proteins begins even during translation of the polypeptide chain. Failure to fold into native structure generally produces inactive proteins, but \n\n A cell membrane defines a boundary between a cell and its environment. In this model, the cell membrane surface is modeled as a two-dimensional fluid-like lipid bilayer where the lipid molecules can move freely. The proteins are partially or fully embedded in the lipid bilayer. The membrane skeleton is a network of proteins below the bilayer that links with the proteins in the lipid membrane. Protein folding is the physical process by which a protein chain is translated to its native three-dimensional structure, typically a \"folded\" conformation by which the protein becomes biologically functional. Via an expeditious and reproducible process, a polypeptide folds into its characteristic three-dimensional structure from a random coil. As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by\n\n"

For a discussion of other discontinued and canceled denominations, see Obsolete denominations of United States currency and Canceled denominations of United States currency. $1 coins were first issued in 1984, and $2 coins soon followed in 1988. The one- and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1990 and withdrawn from circulation in February 1992.\n\n"

Boone sustains severe injuries and, despite Jack's attempts to treat him, dies on November 2, 2004. Boone tries to pass a message to Shannon through Jack, but dies before he is able to finish the sentence. Somerhalder said the news of his character's death was \"pretty devastating\", which is notable for being the first death of a major character on the series. The beginning scene is replayed, but it is shown that Cliff made a conscious decision to not call 911. Back to the present, Cliff arrives at the hospital with the skin, but finds that Abby has already died. He throws away Trish's body pieces, then goes home to be greeted by Abby's spirit.\n\n"

Virginia kept the lead for much of the second half, but Texas Tech stayed in the game and took the lead, until De'Andre Hunter of Virginia hit a game-tying three point shot with 12 seconds left in regulation. On March 21 4th-seeded Maryland faced off against 5th-seeded West Virginia. Prior to the game on March 26, West Virginia guard Daxter Miles Jr. guaranteed that the Mountaineers would hand the Wildcats their first loss of the season, claiming the Wildcats were going to be 36-1. The comment by Miles made ESPN's SportsCenter prior to the game and created a lot of commentary prior to the game about the Mountaineers chances against the Wildcats. The commentary by the West Virginia player only fueled the Kentucky players. The game went into a five-minute overtime. Virginia ran out the clock to secure the win with a final score of 85–77. Culver, meanwhile, struggled during the game while primarily defended by Hunter (NABC Defensive Player of the Year) and scored 15 points while shooting 5-for-22 (.227), including 0-for-6 on three point shots.\n\nQuestion: who beat university of virginia in basketball this year\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is later revealed that Barry's mentor Harrison Wells, who was training Barry after he became a speedster, is actually the murderer Eobard Thawne, the Flash's archenemy from the 22nd century and a descendant of police officer Eddie Thawne.

After being exposed and later captured by Barry with help from Oliver Queen, Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, Thawne offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save the Allen family in exchange for a time machine to return to the 22nd century. Barry ultimately refuses and destroys Thawne's machine. Barry later travels back in time to season one's timeframe to obtain Thawne's help with tachyon equipment. In season three, Barry saves Nora from Thawne's true form who is locked up in a prison. After the Flashpoint timeline's dangers, Barry realizes the mistake and releases Thawne to kill Nora again hoping the timeline will revert to normal.

In the present, the murderer ultimately appears as a tachyon-enhanced speedster who is dubbed the \"Reverse-Flash\", and bests Barry in combat. It is later revealed that Barry's mentor Harrison Wells, who was training Barry after he became a speedster, is actually the murderer Eobard Thawne, the Flash's archenemy from the 22nd century and a descendant of police officer Eddie Thawne. Traveling to the 21st century to erase the Flash from history by murdering Nora and framing \n\n Thawne was left stranded with his Speed Force connection severed so he killed the real Wells and assumed his identity. After being exposed and later captured by Barry with help from Oliver Queen, Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, Thawne offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save the Allen family in exchange for a time machine to return to the 22nd century. Barry ultimately refuses and destroys Thawne's machine. Barry later travels back in time to season one's timeframe to obtain Thawne's help with tachyon equipment. In season three, Barry saves Nora from Thawne's true form who is locked up in a prison. After the Flashpoint timeline's dangers, Barry realizes the mistake and releases Thawne to kill Nora again hoping the timeline will revert to normal. Following the Flash, she turns her attention to Batman where she cuts into his shoulder with her scythe, and again in his back, pinning him to the ground before spotting Cyborg, in whom she recognizes the power of the Mother Box, and demands that he give it up to her.\n\n"

In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent of the brain's total weight. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).\n\n"

Less similar is the position in the Senate (the upper house) known as President Pro Tempore, the holder of which has since 1945 gained the position through seniority, but who also must be a member of the party holding a majority in the Senate. Since 2017, the Dean of the House has been Don Young, who was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election in 1973. The 2021-23 term is part of the 89th General Assembly. The presiding officer is the Speaker of the House, who is chosen by the majority party and elected by the House. In addition, representatives elect a Speaker Pro Tempore, chosen in the same manner as the Speaker, \n\n The names of members of the House of Representatives are preceded by their district numbers. The current Dean is Don Young, a Republican Party U.S. Representative from Alaska, who has served since 1973 and is the first Republican Dean in more than eighty years, as well as the first from Alaska.\n\n"
