In his famous 1905 'Special Relativity' paper, Albert Einstein  showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under a Lorentz \n\n  Around 1904–1905, the works of Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and finally Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, exclude the possibility of propagation of any effects faster than the speed of light. In 1907 Einstein came to the conclusion that to achieve this a successor to special relativity was needed. From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his equivalence principle as a key concept to guide his way. According \n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz made significant contributions to both physics and society. In the field of physics, Lorentz played a crucial role in the development of the classical theory of electromagnetism. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, Lorentz formulated the electron theory, which provided electromagnetism with its final form. This transformation preceded Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity and laid the foundation for it. Lorentz's contributions to theoretical physics were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. He played an influential role in promoting the new developments in physics through his involvement in the Solvay conferences as the chairman. Furthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time, expressed that Lorentz meant more to him personally than anyone else he had met in his life. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the\n\nQuestion: who got the first nobel prize in physics\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The next three X-Men films after X-Men: The Last Stand opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records. In North America, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series, and it also has the highest opening weekend. Worldwide, Deadpool was the highest-grossing film in the series and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, before being surpassed on both records by its sequel. 20 million, so it's trying to fit that financial model into the sequel model so it makes sense for the studio and being able to pay the actors what they now get paid and deserve to get paid.

This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet. Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 to 10 metres); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band. This is called skywave or \"skip\" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 64 km (40 miles). However, unlike short-wave, this communication equipment is restricted by range (usually several miles, at most), but is relatively simple to operate and the main power source is usually provided by batteries. Additionally, many non-professionals may use unlicensed two-way radios, as is common with CB radio, Family Radio Service or PMR446. Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries.\n\nQuestion: which mode is used for short wave broadcast service\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the south- or the Cape Doctor, so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a persistent high-pressure system over the South Atlantic to the west of Cape Town, known as the South Atlantic High, which shifts latitude seasonally, following the sun, and influencing the strength of the fronts \n\n During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in \n\n erosion. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.\n\nQuestion: the south west wind blows across nigeria between\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked. The game ends when all of the characters' HP levels reach zero, although the player can continue from the beginning of the battle or the last checkpoint. Players are able to perform two types of attacks: a Bravery attack and an HP attack. Both characters start with a set number of Bravery points, the number of Bravery points being equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by an HP attack. Thus, the player must perform several Bravery attacks to steal Bravery points from the opponent so as to increase the power of their HP attack, as Bravery attacks do not cause any damage. The key words here are fair and eventually – if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react. Player characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file.\n\nQuestion: what does hp mean in war and order\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Candidates are not elected directly by the citizens, but by the Members of Legislative Assemblies and up to 12  can be nominated by the President of India for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members of the Parliament in Rajya Sabha get a tenure of six years, with one-third of the body facing re-election every two years. Rajya Sabha acts as a second-level review body before a bill becomes an act. The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. Former prime ministerial adviser Sanjaya Baru published a book titled The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh in which he criticised Singh for not being \"fully in charge of his government in having to compete with the dynastic INC leader, Sonia Gandhi, for influence within his own cabinet.\" Singh's office retorted in saying it is \"smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser.\" After Baru said \"it is no secret that Sonia Gandhi was the super prime minister,\" Priyanka Vadra replied \"I think Manmohan Singh ji is the super PM.\" The opposition targeted Sonia Gandhi on the basis of this book. A key event in the spread of the disease across metropolitan France as well as its overseas territories was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February 2020 in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus. This was extended twice and ended on 11 May 2020, after a progressive lifting of lockdown and as face masks were made available to all citizens. On 2 May 2020, Health Minister Olivier Véran announced that the government would seek to extend the health emergency period until 24 July 2020. Véran's bill was discussed in Senate on 4 May 2020. On 15 October 2020, police raided the homes and offices of key government officials, including Véran and Philippe, in a criminal negligence probe opened by the Cour de Justice de la République. On 31 March 2021, Macron announced a third national lockdown which commenced on 3 April 2021 and which was mandated for all of April 2021; measures included the closure of non-essential shops, the suspension of school attendance, a ban on domestic travel and a nationwide curfew from 7pm-6am. Background \nThe pandemic occurred following a series of national protests, which were followed by a strike against pension reform which had been proposed by President Emmanuel Macron in his election manifesto. In President Emmanuel Macron's second address to the nation on the pandemic on 16 March 2020, he announced the suspension of all reforms, notably those of pensions. On 21 January 2020, Agnès Buzyn, Minister of Solidarity and Health declared that \"The risk of introduction into France is low but it cannot be excluded\". On 27 December 2019, a man was admitted to Avicenne Hospital and tested for influenza, which came back as negative. Cohen said it was too early to know if the man had been France's \"patient zero\". He was placed in isolation, and the authorities tried to trace people who had been in contact with him. The 31-year-old man and his 30-year-old partner, both from Wuhan, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised at Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris. On 26 January 2020, Buzyn declared that the French government had millions of masks which could be distributed to the population if necessary. On 28 January 2020, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist from Hubei tested positive and was hospitalised at Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital. On 31 January 2020, Marie Fontanel, the President counselor for solidarity and health, quit her job to help her husband in the coming municipal elections. She would be replaced only one month later. The same day, all the countries of the Schengen Area, except France, suspended the issuing of visas in China. They contracted the infection from a British national who had attended a conference in Singapore a few days before. On 18 February 2020, Minister of Health, Olivier Véran – who replaced Agnès Buzyn after she stood down to run in the Paris mayoral election for La République En Marche! A 60-year-old French teacher from Oise was first admitted to Creil Hospital, then transferred to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, where he died a few hours later. The same day, during an audition by the French Senate, Jérôme Salomon, the French Directeur général de la Santé, declared that \"A mask shortage is not a subject\". The annual gathering of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February 2020 in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people became a significant cluster in the spread of coronavirus in France. On 3 March 2020, seven participants in the evangelical rally – including five members of a local family and a general practitioner from Bernwiller – had tested positive for the virus. According to an investigative report by Radio France, at least half of the attendees had contracted the virus; in an interview on France Info, the pastor of the church admitted that 2000 attendees may have been infected. It is said that no specific health advice existed in light of the threat at the time. Even President Emmanuel Macron had spent several hours electioneering on 18 February 2020 in the Bourtzwiller district close to the church. On 5 March 2020, a retired couple from Lot-et-Garonne and another person from Deux-Sèvres who had attended the same Mulhouse gathering were declared positive for the disease. The department of Haut-Rhin, in which Mulhouse is situated, imposed strict limits on the gatherings; all schools were closed henceforth. Municipal elections \n\nThe first round of municipal elections in France took place on 15 March 2020 against the backdrop of the government decision to move to Stage III of measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Then-Health Minister, Agnès Buzyn, resigned on 16 February 2020 to run for the Paris mayor for La République En Marche!. She is succeeded by Olivier Véran, a neurologist. The decision to press ahead with the election was justified as being critical to democratic life in the country, despite concerns about how a second round could be held as the toll of infections and deaths continued to rise. In the end, the turnout of registered voters was 40%, lower than achieved in 1971 – the previous record lowest turnout. On 12 March 2020, Emmanuel Macron announced in a televised address that all schools and universities across the country would be closed. On 13 March 2020, the Prime Minister, Édouard Philippe announced the closure of all pubs, restaurants, cinemas and nightclubs. On 16 March 2020 (one day after the first round of the municipal elections), Emmanuel Macron announced the beginning of a lockdown period from 17 March 2020 at noon. After the announcement of the lockdown, the Fédération Française du Bâtiment decided to stop non-essential work because of the danger for construction workers. On 19 March 2020, Muriel Pénicaud, the French Minister of Labour, criticized this decision, saying that it showed a lack of civic spirit. On 20 March 2020, the President of the federation replied in an open letter that what the Minister said was \"scandalous\". After several days, an agreement allowing a few construction sites to reopen was signed. The lockdown had initially been planned for 15 days, then for 30 days, but on 13 April 2020, Macron announced that the lockdown period would be extended until 11 May 2020. On 28 May 2020, Édouard Philippe announced that a travel ban of 100 km (62 miles) would be lifted on 2 June 2020. This easing of restrictions did not apply to Paris. On 3 July 2020, Philippe resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Jean Castex. Castex had previously been appointed coordinator of the phasing out of the lockdown (confinement) implemented in France. On 15 July 2020, Olivier Véran announced that from 24 July 2020, face coverings would be compulsory in all public indoor spaces and some outdoor public areas such as the Eiffel Tower. August–October 2020\nDuring August 2020, cases began to rise again. With this in mind, Paris made it compulsory to wear face coverings in most public spaces. However, the government kept insisting that they would not impose a second nationwide lockdown. President Macron announced in an interview on prime-time television on 14 October 2020 that in view of the vertiginous spread of the disease in several major cities, there would be 9 pm–6am curfews imposed in areas which have become hotspots for the virus in the country, to last for 4 weeks; the financial aid measures and furloughing scheme for affected business would be re-introduced. On 22 October 2020, Prime Minister of France Jean Castex extended the overnight curfew to 38 more departments as cases surged, affecting 46 million people (67% population). On 28 October 2020, Macron announced on a televised address that France would enter a second nationwide lockdown from 30 October 2020 that would last until at least 1 December 2020. Non-essential businesses such as pubs and restaurants would close but schools and factories would remain open. November 2020 \nOn 5 November 2020, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced further restrictions in Paris after some citizens were caught disobeying existing rules. These included requiring food shops to close at 10:00 pm to prevent people from gathering there. On 12 November 2020, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said in a press conference that any loosening of restrictions at the start of December would be \"strictly limited\", meaning businesses like restaurants, bars and sports halls would remain closed. December 2020 \nOn 17 December 2020, Macron tested positive for COVID-19. She received the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the René-Muret Hospital in Sevran, Seine-Saint-Denis. 2021 \nOn 31 March 2021, in a televised address to the nation, President Macron announced a third national lockdown to begin on 3 April 2021, and to last for at least a month. Macron warned that the country would \"lose control if we do not move now\". Principal measures announced included the closure of non-essential shops during the national lockdown and the suspension of attendance at schools for three weeks. On 29 April, President Macron announced dates for the easing of restrictions from the third national lockdown:\n\n 19 May: Curfew moves from 19:00 to 21:00. Shops, museums, cinemas, terraces, outdoor sports venues can reopen. 2022 \nOn 5 January, President Macron said he, \"really wants to piss off the non-vaccinated\". On 13 January, the French Senate approves President Macron's new set of measures that include a vaccine pass to enter public facilitates. One day later his wife was hospitalised. On 27 February, a friend and his daughter followed him into the hospital. On 2 March 2020, 26 people were COVID-19 positive in Haute-Savoie. The hospital in Annecy being saturated, a case was transferred to Chambéry. François Daviet, the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy was also hospitalised. On 27 February 2020, a man from Francheville was admitted to a Lyon hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. On the same day, two other men from Ferney-Voltaire, one French national who works in Switzerland and one Italian national, were also hospitalised in the Helvetic Country. On 2 March 2020, an 89-year-old woman from Nyons was treated at Valréas hospital in the Enclave of the Popes in Vaucluse and tested COVID-19 positive. Two were in the western city of Brest, an elderly man from Plougonvelin, returning from a trip from Egypt and his wife. On 2 March 2020, it was announced that ten more people tested positive in the Grand Est, eight hospitalised in Strasbourg and three in Nancy. In Alsace, a Molsheim couple was hospitalised. The man had returned from Italy and was hospitalised first, followed by his wife. The five departments of Hauts-de-France now each had at least one proven case of people infected by the coronavirus. On 2 March 2020, it was announced the second death in Hauts-de-France and the third at the national level, a woman of 89 \"diagnosed post-mortem\" at the hospital of Compiègne. Île-de-France \nOn 25 February 2020, a young woman returned from China was hospitalised in the Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris but showed signs of recovery and was out of hospital on 26 February 2020. He was working for a contractor of Charles de Gaulle Airport. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial International Women's Day march occurred in Paris on 8 March 2020. He is a French resident in Eure. She lived near Compiègne, in the Oise department, where a dozen cases had already been identified. The first case was detected on 28 February 2020; a 27-year-old woman from the Sarthe declared herself to the SAMU centre 15 after a stay in Milan in Italy. A young woman from Cannes was infected after a journey in Milan. This replaced local measures which had already been taken in Nice, Béziers, and Cannes. The first death was announced on 20 April 2020. Overseas and sui generis collectivities\n\nFrench Polynesia \n\nMaina Sage, a French politician representing French Polynesia at the French national assembly, was diagnosed with the first case of COVID-19 in French Polynesia on 11 March 2020. Their son, who lives on the neighbouring island of Saint Barthélemy, also tested positive. Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier\n\nThe Ministry of Armed Forces reported infections on board one of its ships on 8 April 2020. The ministry initially announced that out of 66 personnel tested, 50 were positive. Three sailors were evacuated by air to . There was criticism in France the carrier mission was not interrupted after the first cases were detected, and rumours that the carrier had asked permission to interrupt its mission in mid March during its stopover in Brest, which had been refused. Florence Parly, the French Minister of Armed Forces, said that these rumours were false when questioned by French deputies. Effects on civilian life\n\nClosures \nOn 28 February 2020, the fashion designer agnès b. cancelled fashion shows in Paris Fashion Week, which had been scheduled to run until 3 March. In a televised statement on 12 March 2020, President of the Republic Emmanuel Macron decreed the closure of nurseries, schools, colleges, high schools and universities. The Ministry of Health requested the deprogramming of non-urgent surgical procedures. From the next day, gatherings of more than 100 people were prohibited. Without this declaration individuals could be fined if found engaging in non-essential movement. Initially it was necessary to carry a paper copy of the declaration but later a QR code based electronic equivalent for smartphones became an option. Police around the country set up road blocks to check those outside their homes had good reason and that their exemption declarations were in order. Police report receiving hundreds of telephone denunciations from citizens complaining of their neighbours walking their dogs too often; a woman also denounced her husband for going out to see his mistress. On 28 September 2020, according to an Amnesty International report French authorities wrongly punished thousands of peaceful protesters under draconian laws in pre and post COVID-19 crackdowns. Many people were arbitrarily fined, arrested, and detained for peaceful protests. Unemployment \nPresident Macron announced on 12 March 2020 that companies could postpone the payment of social security contributions and taxes due in March without justification, formalities, or penalties. An \"exceptional and massive\" mechanism of state-funded furloughing (partial lay-offs) was envisaged. Employees were encouraged to practise teleworking where possible. Shortage of masks controversy \n\nStrategic stocks of masks in 2009 under Roselyne Bachelot, minister of health from May 2007 to November 2010, amounted to 1 billion surgical masks and 600 million FFP2 masks. Then-health minister Agnès Buzyn declared on 26 January that there would be no shortage of masks in France during the outbreak. On 3 March, with France still facing a shortage, President Macron commandeered all masks produced and stored in the country for distribution to health professionals and people who had contracted the virus. France was subsequently accused of seizing medical equipment intended for other nations. All had been contracted for, including a million masks each for France, Italy and Spain. On 27 April 2020, it was revealed by Libération that, contrary to government claims in March, a change of doctrine was not the main cause of the mask shortage, and that the government had been fully informed as early as 2018 that strategic reserves were depleted. Raoult has nevertheless offered testing of those with symptoms at his institute and prescribed hydroxychloroquine for those who tested positive. The French Health Minister, Olivier Véran, announced that \"new tests will now go ahead to evaluate the results of Raoult, to independently replicate the trials and ensure the findings are scientifically robust, before any possible decision might be made to roll any treatment out to the wider public\". On 3 December 2021, the Order of Physicians in France gave Raoult a blame for promoting hydroxychloroquine \"whithout scientific data\". Chinese Embassy article\n\nIn mid-April 2020, the Chinese embassy published an online article entitled \"Restoring distorted facts – Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris\", which criticised western countries' slow response and accused workers at nursing homes in France of \"abandoning their posts overnight … and leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease\". French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian summoned the Chinese ambassador, and said that the remarks were not in line with the \"quality of the bilateral relationship\" between France and China.

T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's scenario, crafted by Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa after a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, is far simpler and less nuanced than Hoffmann's original story. Vsevolozhsky and Petipa entirely omitted the Nutcracker character's complex backstory, \"The Story of the Hard Nut,\" and expanded a short, satiric passage set in a Kingdom of Sweets to cover the whole of Act II. Clara and her Prince travel to the Land Of Peace and Harmony instead of visiting the Sugar Plum Fairy, to fit the company's theme of international and cultural unity. Most romantic and classical ballets of the 19th century were narrative ballets. Among the most well known are Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences. Choreography: Alexander Gorsky (after Petipa) ; Company: Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow ; Premiere: 1919  Russian choreographer Alexander Gorsky, who staged a production of The Nutcracker in Moscow in 1919, is credited with the idea of combining Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy's roles (i.e. giving the Fairy's dances to Clara), eliminating the Sugar Plum Fairy's Cavalier, giving the Cavalier's dances to the Nutcracker Prince, and having the roles of Clara and the Nutcracker Prince danced by adults, thereby introducing a reason for a love interest between the two characters that had not been present in the original ballet.\n\nQuestion: swan lake the sleeping beauty and the nutcracker are three famous ballets by\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail.

In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths. Each part of the eye plays a special role in the visual process that allows us to see. The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time. The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye. The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished. The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre). Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away. - Robert Hooke According to Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of natural selection, features such as coloration evolved by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage. The cornea acts as the lens of the camera, while the pupillary diameter functions like the aperture. It has a layer of photoreceptors within its protective casing, which respond to light. The lens system of the eye helps to focus light onto these photoreceptors. This process is known as accommodation. The retina is intricate in its organization. It contains a layer of photoreceptor cells known as rods and cones. The electrical responses produced by rods and cones are crucial in vision. The signals travel from the retina to the optic nerve, then to the optic chiasm, where fibers from each eye cross over. From there, visual information is transmitted to the thalamus and then to the visual cortex in the brain. These two processes are essential for optimal vision. It is a complex process that allows us to perceive and differentiate between different colors. However, the eye is far more sophisticated than a camera, with intricate structures and processes involved in the complex process of vision. The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. \"The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left. \"(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium).

The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure. Marty Lagina – A millionaire vineyard owner who is also part owner of most of Oak Island in Nova Scotia and one of the main characters on The Curse of Oak Island, the parent series ; Kevin Dykstra – A facilities director at a Muskegon high school and part time treasure hunter who is a certified diver ; Brad Richards – A history teacher and part time treasure hunter ; Fred Monroe – A researcher, Kevin's friend and a part time treasure hunter ; Al Dykstra – Kevin's younger brother and a certified diver ; Jeff Zehr – A researcher on the team who is a certified diver ; Alex Lagina – Son of Marty Lagina and a certified diver. By this time, there were many shafts, bore holes, and tunnels under Oak Island made by previous treasure hunters. Having found \n\n in Oak Island Tours announced on their website that the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage had granted them a treasure-trove license which allowed them to resume activities until December 31, 2010. After December 2010, the departments repealed the treasure-trove license and replaced it with an Oak Island Treasure Act. Oak Island Mystery refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects found on or near Oak Island in Nova Scotia. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. \"The curse\" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found.\n\nQuestion: where is the tv show the curse of oak island filmed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When stimulated, the gall bladder releases its secretion, which is bile, into the small intestine through the common bile duct. The gall bladder is lined with a simple columnar epithelial tissue, and its walls are composed of three visible coats: an internal mucous and muscular coat, a middle connective tissue layer, and an outermost serous membrane. The main function of the gall bladder is to store and concentrate bile. While in the gall bladder, the bile undergoes concentration until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. During a fatty meal, the gall bladder contracts to release bile into the small intestine to emulsify fats and neutralize the acids in the partially-digested food. However, it is important to note that the formation of gallstones is a common issue associated with the gall bladder due to its high cholesterol content. In some cases, when gallstones cause complications or persistent symptoms, a surgical procedure called cholecystectomy may be necessary to remove the gall bladder. Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Gallstone ileus is a rare form of small bowel obstruction caused by an impaction of a gallstone within the lumen of the small intestine. Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \"gallstone ileus\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone). Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat.The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver.The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder.Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.In humans the caecum is about 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length, but in animals the caecum/appendix can be very long; for example, in horses it can measure up to 1 metre (3 feet 4 inches) and contains enzymes for processing grass-based food. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat. **3-SECOND INCISION**\n\nThe liver is the body's largest gland; it removes toxicants, produces bile to assist digestion and breaks down red blood cells.The gall bladder stores bile for use by the small intestine.\n\nQuestion: where is gall bladder situated in human body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1934 to the present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar. The last 90% silver coins were minted in 1964, and the last 40% silver half dollar was minted in 1970. The United States Mint currently produces circulating coins at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints, and commemorative and proof coins for collectors at the San Francisco and West Point Mints. By the Act, the Mint was to be situated at the seat of government of \n\n production by Mint Sculptor-Engraver (now Chief Engraver) Joseph F. Menna. Artists at the Mint produced three designs for the reverse, and in June 2017, both CFA and CCAC agreed on one of them. That design was by U.S. Mint Sculptor-Engraver Phebe Hemphill, who also engraved her side of the coin. The two winning designs were unveiled on October 11, 2018, at the NASM in Washington, DC, in the presence of dignitaries such as Mint Director David J. Ryder and Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham.

Although the iron analogue is the most commercial owing to its stability, the same composition exists for nickel, manganese, and cobalt although the observed high cell charging voltages and synthetic challenges for these materials make them viable but more difficult to commercialize. While the material has good \n\n  lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. The first commercialized lithium-ion chemistry was a lithium cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode first demonstrated by N. Godshall in 1979, and by John Goodenough, and Akira Yoshino shortly thereafter. Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly. The cathode comprises particles of sulfur \"redox center\", carbon, and electrolyte. During discharge, the lithium ions plate the cathode with lithium metal and the sulfur is not reduced unless irreversible deep discharge occurs. The thickened cathode is a compact way to store the used lithium. The energy density of is lower than that of lithium cobalt oxide, and also has a lower operating voltage. Therefore, all the cathodes under consideration are actually /C (composite made with carbon). Because of low cost, low toxicity, well-defined performance, long-term stability, etc. is finding a number of roles in vehicle use, utility scale stationary applications, and backup power.\n\nQuestion: what is the main mineral in lithium batteries\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the \"acquisition or requisition of property\" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III). It is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source \n\n the state's 'eminent domain' powers. The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. Three forms of property is presented by the constitution: public, collective and individual property. Also incorporated into the text are a chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, as well as a chapter on directive \n\n The Indian constitution's preamble states that India is a secular state. According to Article 25 of the Indian Constitution, every citizen of India has the right to \"profess, practice and propagate religion\", \"subject to public order, morality and health\" and also subject to other provisions under that article.

Either Trump or Biden would have been the oldest President in American history, with Biden ultimately prevailing. Biden was 78 when he was sworn in on 20 January 2021, making him the oldest person to be inaugurated president of the United States. The Biden administration's cabinet appointments have also reflected these gerontocratic tendencies. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009. Biden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, moving with his family to New Castle County, Delaware in 1953 when he was ten. As the running mate of Barack Obama, Biden was elected vice president of the United States in 2008 and 2012. In his third presidential campaign—following previous efforts in 1988 and 2008—he was elected President of the United States in 2020. This is the electoral history of Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States. Biden served as the 47th vice president (2009–2017), and as a United States senator from Delaware (1973–2009). Biden assumed the Vice Presidency on January 20, 2009 and served until January 20, 2017.

Main\n\nOverview\n\nNotes\n\nDr. Will Halstead\n\nPortrayed by Nick Gehlfuss\n\nDr. Will Halstead is an attending in the Emergency Department. After the backdoor pilot of Chicago Med, he decided to switch specialties to emergency medicine. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another. He also earns the ire of attending Dr. Kendra Perrington in the episode \"Inheritance\" for overriding her at the request of the patient's brother, who was his former schoolmate, only to find out that she was on the hiring committee. For much of early season 2, he stresses out over his finances as he still had to pay off his student loans and sizeable malpractice insurance (due to his malpractice suit from the episode \"Clarity\"). He initially sees final year medical student Jeff Clarke as a rival for Natalie's affections but develops a friendship with Clarke and often encourages him. During the first season, Dr. Halstead had feelings for the pediatric emergency medicine fellow, Dr. Natalie Manning, who was then pregnant with her late husband's baby. It caused some awkwardness as her mother-in-law (portrayed by actress Annie Potts) was extremely protective and initially viewed him with suspicion. They move in together in the season 2 episode \"Free Will\". They break up in finale of season 2 because he still has feelings for Dr. Manning. In season 4 they prepare for their wedding but Dr. Halstead finds himself in a difficult position when a neighborhood friend he made a house call to turns out to be federally listed criminal wanted by both the CPD and FBI. His brother convinces him to continue making the house calls in order to feed information to the joint CPD-FBI task force. Jay still has some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their late mother was ill (she died of cancer). Natalie was widowed when her husband, Jeff, a soldier, was killed in Afghanistan and gave birth to their son, Owen. She is revealed to be a skilled  violinist, as seen in season 1 episode \"Fallback\" and season 2 episode \"Brother's Keeper\". In Season 1, Episode 10, \"Clarity\", Dr Will Halstead kisses her, showing her that he has feelings for her. However, as she is grieving her late husband, she gently tells Dr Halstead that she does have feelings for him, it just \"isn't the right time yet\". After their break up, he ends up dancing with Natalie while at Noah's graduation party. At the end of Season 4, Agent Lee convinces Natalie to take Will back, so she goes after him and gets into his car as she was going to tell him that she still loves him, until a car hits them. While unconscious, her ex-boyfriend, Phillip Davis slipped a ring onto her finger and convinced everyone that they were engaged, except for Dr Marcel who brings it up with Phillip and tells Will. In Season 6, Natalie alters data on a trial Will is running to have her mother accepted. She then stole medication to treat her mother in secret. Will was irate when finding out but ready to take the blame for it. April's parents were immigrants from Brazil. She attended high school with Severide and they share a close friendship. He had been going through a rebellious phase in high school after being abandoned by his father and the Sextons often invited him to their house out of concern. He proposes to her in the episode \"Inherent Bias\". In the season 2 fall finale, it was revealed she that she is pregnant. However, April suffers a miscarriage and her engagement to Tate ends. In the season 2 finale, “Love Hurts” the doctors celebrate Noah Sexton's (April's younger brother) graduation party after he graduated medical school. As she stands there, Dr. Ethan Choi walks over and kisses her. A nurse grows suspicious of them and asks her questions, which April simply ignores. In season 1 she was a final year medical student, still undecided about which specialty to choose. She has difficulty dealing with death and the experience of having to call time of death on a patient gets to her. During the season 1 finale, Sarah's mother does not attend her graduation from medical school but sends her money. This episode takes place after she found out that Doctor Charles discovered that her father was suspected to be a serial killer, causing a fallout between them. She decided to leave Chicago Med and joined Baylor, as she said she could no longer trust Dr. Charles when he kept information about her father from her. After Dr. Downey died, Connor was mentored by Dr. Latham, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Dr. Rhodes comes from a wealthy background and was written as a \"local boy\" who left Chicago to escape his family before returning many years later. His father, Cornelius Rhodes, was against Connor choosing to practice medicine rather than work in the family business (a high-end department store in Chicago), and he would repeatedly undermine and discourage Connor to the point where father and son are barely on speaking terms. In the episode \"Inheritance\" his sister Claire resorts to calling him at work and then confronting him in person to call him out on abandoning her in his attempt to get away from their father years ago. Connor remained in denial of this fact, remembering her as a doting and involved parent and blaming his father's infidelities for her suicide. In the episode “Forever Hold Your Peace”, Connor accepts the truth about his relationship with his mother at his father's prodding, but his father dies suddenly before they can reconcile. In the following episode, he visits his father's body in the morgue, and admits that while Cornelius was a bad father, he (Connor) was also a bad son. In season 2 he meets epidemiologist Dr. Robin Charles at the hospital cafeteria and they become friends, although it initially caused some awkwardness once he found out that she was Dr. Daniel Charles' daughter. They began cohabiting in the episode \"Win Loss\". In the episode \"Ties That Bind\", Robin broke up with Rhodes by leaving a letter on the table for him to read. He confronted Dr. Charles on the break up and vowed that he will find her to make the relationship work; however, Dr. Charles said that Robin had wanted to get treatment for her condition in peace. At the end of the episode \"Folie à Deux\" they are seen kissing one another. When the failed operation is revealed to be due to a faulty implant, Connor briefly considers that he may have been wrong; however his father's sudden death by an insulin overdose, and Bekker's subsequent behaviour, leads him to believe that she is the killer. In season 5, after the deaths of both his father and Bekker, who committed suicide after admitting to killing Cornelius in an attempt to win him back, Connor leaves Chicago to have a fresh start. He initially tries to run his own system but quickly realizes that Maggie and the nurses are actually the ones in charge. A second generation Navy veteran, Dr. Choi switched to the reserves to begin his residency and is revealed to be suffering from PTSD. He has only ever discussed his military service with fellow veterans, as seen in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Forty-Caliber Bread Crumb\", when he has drinks with former Army Rangers and combat veterans Detective Jay Halstead (Dr. Halstead's brother) and CPD tech analyst Greg \"Mouse\" Gurwitch at Molly's. Despite his cool and collected demeanor, it is apparent that he has been deeply affected by the horrors he witnessed overseas as well as in the ED. In the season 5 episode \"I Can’t Imagine the Future\" he is recalled by the Navy to cover for an aircraft carrier medical officer who had fallen ill and would be deployed for two months. He lived with his then girlfriend Dr. Vicky Glass (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), who works at the nearby VA hospital and is a fellow Navy veteran. This is due to April's belief that she will be viewed negatively if her co-workers knew of the relationship. In the episode \"Intervention\" they celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary. In the episode \"Extreme Measures\" she initiates divorce proceedings and tells the attorney that she and her husband were past reconciliation. The character has also crossed over to Chicago P.D. whenever Voight's team are dealing with a suspect or victim suffering from a psychiatric disorder which renders them dangerous and unpredictable. One of his daughters Robin works at Chicago Med as an epidemiologist and was in a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. In the season 2 finale, he is shot after a patient waited a long time to be seen and didn't get the care he needed. She has no qualms about calling out the doctors when needed and they generally defer to her for guidance during a chaotic shift (\"Baghdad\" mode). In season 1 she and April made sure the then-pregnant Dr. Manning did not overwork and was her \"birthing partner\". In the episode \"Natural History\", it is revealed that she comes from a large and close-knit extended family and has a sister, Denise who was male at birth, had gender confirmation surgery and moved to Dallas, Texas. In season 4, Ava becomes an attending in the CT department. She and Dr. Rhodes also have a brief romantic relationship, which ends poorly. However, when Rhode's father dies suddenly of an insulin overdose while recovering from a second surgery, Bekker tells Connor that his father will no longer get in the way of there relationship, apparently believing that his father was the only thing keeping them apart. Connor, appalled by this, rejects her, telling her it is too late, so she furiously leaves. In season 5, when the authorities and Dr. Isidore Latham start an investigation of Cornelius' suspicious death, she tries to get her revenge on Connor by suggesting to them that Connor might be his father's killer. Realizing what she's doing, Connor starts arguing with her more and more, until Latham, seeing their animosity declares he's close to solving the case; therefore, Bekker admits to Connor that she murderered his father in an effort to win him back and then commits suicide by slitting her own throat with a scalpel. A horrified Connor and Latham attempt to save her but is too late. Dr. Crockett Marcel\n\nPortrayed by Dominic Rains\n\nDr. Crockett Marcel is a trauma surgeon fellow who eventually replaces Dr. Connor Rhodes after he resigns from Med for a fresh start. He gets suspicious of Phillip Davis after noticing that Dr. Natalie Manning didn't have a wedding ring on her when she was brought in the ER after being hit by a car. He later revealed this to Will Halstead. Dr. Dean Archer\nPortrayed by Steven Weber\n\nDr. Dylan Scott\n\nPortrayed by Guy Lockard\n\nDr. Dylan Scott is the ED pediatrician. He is former Chicago police officer who switched careers to medicine. Recurring\n\nNotes\n\nFamily members\nNoah Sexton (Roland Buck III) is an emergency medicine resident and younger brother of April. It is implied in a conversation Severide had with April that Noah is the \"golden boy\" of the family who got to go to medical school with his sister's financial assistance despite April being the more academically inclined of the siblings. He resorts to using Reese's ideas to earn Dr. Choi's favor, but she finds out about it and gives him a cold shoulder. He is fired by Dr. Choi after he committed a medical negligence. Cornelius Rhodes (D. W. Moffett) was the father of Dr. Connor Rhodes. His wife Elizabeth died at some point before the pilot. As the only son and heir to the family fortune, Connor was expected to follow his father into the family business but eschews it for medicine. Elizabeth's death and Connor's choice to go into medicine lead to a bitter estrangement between father and son. In season 4, he was hospitalized for a heart failure, but later was killed when Dr. Ava Bekker overdosed him with insulin. Connor learned the truth about his parents' relationship—and that his mother wasn't the ideal he made her out to be in his grief over her death—just too late to reconcile with Cornelius. In season 1 she takes her co-worker and friend Russell to the hospital after he gets impaled from broken chandelier shards after he saves her from the falling chandelier. Later she and Connor speak to their father about using SNAP on Russell, which she insists on paying for it but Cornelius disagrees. Robin Charles (Mekia Cox) is Dr. Charles' daughter, also a doctor, who worked as epidemiologist in the Med during season 2 and had a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. She left to be with her mother in Minneapolis in season 3, but returned in season 4 episode \"We Hold These Truths\". She is on good terms with Natalie, having been there for her since the death of her son Jeff and acts as an occasional babysitter for her grandson. She then tells Ethan that she's pregnant with Bernard's child and months later she gives birth to a boy which she names him Vincent after her and Ethan's late grandfather. Robert Haywood (Michael Gill) is a professor and the father of Dr. Sarah Reese. After finding more evidence, Dr. Charles confronted Robert, causing him to have a heart attack from recent treatment for it. After he was treated and imprisoned, Sarah decided to leave Chicago to distant herself from her father and Dr. Charles. Patrick \"Pat\" Halstead (Louis Herthum) is the late father of Dr. Will Halstead and Detective Jay Halstead. He first appeared in the Season 2 episode \"Generation Gap\" when Jay calls Will from their childhood house about Pat's heart condition. Pat was later sent for open heart surgery at the end of the episode. According to the brothers, Pat disapproved of their career choices, leading to their estrangement for many years. Will finally reconciled with him at the end of \"Generation Gap\". Pat died in the crossover episode \"When to Let Go\" of complications caused by smoke inhalation from the fire. His father Jeff was part of the U.S. Rangers and died in Afghanistan. Gaffney Chicago Medical Center staff and personnel\nRecurring\nDr. Samuel Abrams (Brennan Brown) is an attending neurosurgeon. She befriended Dr. Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and they started dating. Joey Thomas (Peter Mark Kendall) is a lab tech in pathology (\"the basement\") who dates Dr. Sarah Reese from seasons one to two. Jeff Clarke (Jeff Hephner) is a medical student currently on rotation at Chicago Med. At some point during his military service he met and befriended Dr. Manning's husband, who was also named Jeff. Dr. Rhodes intensely disliked him for his bluntness and seemingly lack of tact but those characteristics are eventually explained by the fact that he was on the autism spectrum. He was instrumental in discovering evidence that Dr. Ava Bekker murdered Cornelius Rhodes, which led to her suicide. In the episode \"Monday Mourning\" he commits suicide by walking off the roof of the hospital. His husband represented Sharon during her divorce (season 2, episode 5 \"Extreme Measures\"). He is also the older brother of Dr. Will Halstead. The brothers are close but had drifted apart as Jay still had some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their mother was dying of cancer. Will once expressed regret that he was not around when Jay came home from his deployment and was in dire need of familial support. Paramedic Allen Chout (Alex Weisman) is a paramedic in the CFD.

Fungicide use is the most common treatment by hop growers, with plants receiving on average 8.3 applications per season. The nonprofit trade group Hop Growers of America is an advocate for Integrated Pest Management practices in hop farming. IPM in hop growing involves using a scientifically informed rotation of pesticides, growing a diverse variety of disease resistant cultivars, and practicing proper planting techniques to ensure minimal environmental and economic impact. Idaho, Oregon, and Washington all have laws preventing importation of hop roots from outside of the Pacific Northwest in order to prevent the spread of disease and pests. Also known as hop houses or hop kilns, hop barns were very common in areas of the United States where hops were grown. In New York state's \"hop belt\" numerous hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Ostego, Chenango, Madison, Oneida, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties were the primary areas contained within the hop belt. As hops production basically dwindled down to only Washington state, in the U.S., the remaining hop houses elsewhere have begun to disappear. In the context of beer production, hops are commonly used to provide bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Some popular hop varieties used in brewing include 'Cascade', 'Centennial', 'Willmette', 'Chinook', 'Amarillo', 'Golding', and 'Saaz'. Hops possess properties that can regulate and balance hormonal activity, which may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. The vine dies in winter, but the rhizomes (roots) survive, allowing hops to grow on new wood every year. I hope this information provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the common uses and effects of hops, as well as the specifics of their growth and cultivation. The malted barley comes from Great Western Malting in Pocatello, Idaho and their hops come from Washington. **PLANT**\n\nHops are grown from rhizomes, which are a type of root (technically an underground stem) that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a piece of gingerroot.Hops can regulate and balance hormonal activity so may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. Hops are known to cause \"man boobs\" because of their estrogen-like compounds.

Hanna and \n\n In 2001, a new television special titled Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not \"blame everything on the mouse\". Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bowtie and a kinder disposition in Tom & Jerry Kids. The first Tom and Jerry short/film that Jerry was in is Puss Gets the Boot, and the last is The Karate Guard, the 163rd Tom and Jerry film. Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Jerry is a brown mute anthropomorphic house mouse, who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short Puss Gets the Boot. Hanna gave the mouse's original name as \"Jinx\", while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance. Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

Recently discovered oil reserves have increased the importance of the commodity on African economies. Sudan and Nigeria are two of the main oil producers. Oil is provided by both continental and offshore productions. Five countries dominate Africa's upstream oil production. Together they account for 85% of the continent's oil production and are, in order, from highest to lowest output: Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Angola. Other African oil producing countries are Gabon, the DRC, Cameroon, Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, and more recently, Ghana. Included in this list are Chad, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, and Madagascar, whilst Mozambique and Tanzania are potential oil producers. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Uganda has proven crude oil reserves of 6.5 billion barrels, about 2.2 billion of which is recoverable. The country has the fourth-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Nigeria, Angola, and South Sudan. From the beginning, the preference of the Ugandan government had been to start with a small production capacity refinery to prolong the production longevity of its new oil discoveries. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings.

An An (born 1986 ) is a male giant panda residing in Hong Kong Ocean Park, a gift from the Central People's Government of China to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1999. Jia Yueyue (加悅悅) and Jia Panpan (加盼盼) are twin giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) born at the Toronto Zoo on October 13, 2015, to mother, Er Shun. 1) Government enforced policies to stop the development of forest area in China. Institutes in China, for instance, the China Research and Conservation Centre for the giant panda, Wolong (卧龍) and the Chengdu (成都) Research base of giant panda Breeding have successfully breed many giant pandas' infants. ; 4) As some of the people living in this forest are usually poor and rely on the pandas' habitat areas for food, the conservation program is designed to help improve the livelihood of those people, and educate them to protect the natural reserves for the pandas. Due to deforestation for agricultural landuse, the pandas are forced to migrate high up to the mountains. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role.

OPEC's power was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as various countries nationalized their oil holdings, and wrested decision-making away from the \"Seven Sisters\" (Anglo-Iranian, Socony, Royal Dutch Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, Socal), and created their own oil companies to control the oil. OPEC often tries to influence prices by restricting production. It does this by allocating each member country a quota for production. Members agree to keep prices high by producing at lower levels than they otherwise would. The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was formed in 1960. At first, OPEC comprised Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and Venezuela only. Although Gas Exporting Countries Forum has seen by some experts as an attempt to form 'gas-OPEC', Attiyah ruled out a creation of OPEC-like cartel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was founded by five oil producing countries at a Baghdad conference on September 14, 1960. The five founding members of OPEC were Venezuela, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. OPEC was organized after the oil companies slashed the posted price of oil, but the posted price of oil remained consistently higher than the market price of oil between 1961 and 1972.

Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans.

Broadhurst Park was completed with a capacity of 4,400 in May 2015. United's ground is in Old Trafford; Manchester City's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester. Fixtures between the clubs are referred to as the Manchester Derby. Manchester City have won seven domestic league titles, most recently in 2021. However, on 4 March 2011 it was announced that Manchester City Council had backed out of plans to fund the new stadium with grants, despite the fact that the previously agreed £1.5 million was close to being raised by fans, and F.C.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of manchester united stadium\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem \"Romance of the Rose\" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose for Emily\" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa. In a postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco discusses the reason behind the title to his 1983 novel: \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\". In modern Catholic thought, the rose window is often associated with the Virgin Mary because one of her titles, referred to by St Bernard of Clairvaux, is the \"Mystical Rose\". The Roman de la Rose, the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Other well-known examples of rose symbolism in Sufism include:\n\n  Various folk cultures and traditions assign symbolic meaning to the rose, though these are seldom understood in-depth.

It is a prequel to The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's landmark 1925 novel. The Great Gatsbys U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain in the United States. Nick centers on the narrator of The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway, in the years before the events of Fitzgerald's novel. It follows Nick Carraway as a soldier in World War I, his detours in Paris, and his time in New Orleans before his move up to Long Island. Although The Great Gatsby received a poor reception in the author's lifetime, it is now considered to be one of the greatest novels in American history. It is even something of a problem for a reviewer to find new \n\n Fitzgerald began working on a new novel almost immediately after the publication of The Great Gatsby in April 1925. The characters based on the Murphys were originally named Seth \n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" explores several themes and issues that are relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. However, Fitzgerald's portrayal of the American Dream in \"The Great Gatsby\" reveals its limitations and challenges the notion that it is equally accessible to everyone. Fitzgerald delves into the extravagance and decadence of the Jazz Age, portraying a society that is obsessed with wealth, glamour, and social status. Through characters like Jay Gatsby and the Buchanans, he critiques the emptiness and moral decay that can accompany the relentless pursuit of wealth and the superficiality of material possessions. Furthermore, \"The Great Gatsby\" delves into the complexities of love and desire. The novel examines the illusions and fantasies that can be constructed around love, particularly in relation to the character of Gatsby and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan. The novel also touches on themes of identity, loneliness, and the loss of innocence. Overall, \"The Great Gatsby\" is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes and issues relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape.\n\nQuestion: where does the story the great gatsby take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some penalties are computed like interest, some are fixed amounts, and some are based on other measures. Penalties for failures related to certain forms are fixed amounts, and vary by form from very small to huge. Intentional failures, including tax fraud, may result in criminal penalties. Penalty for Failure to Timely File Return: If a taxpayer is required to file an income or excise tax return and fails to timely do so, a late filing penalty may be assessed. A minimum penalty of $435 may apply for returns over 60 days late. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay Tax: If a taxpayer fails to pay the balance due shown \n\n According to some estimates, about three percent of American taxpayers do not file tax returns at all. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, civil penalties for willful failure to timely file returns and willful failure to timely pay taxes are based on the amount of tax due; thus, if no tax is owed, no penalties are due.

We have been sick and the baby has been, well, a baby. This is called the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP screening test). This is also called a sonogram and can show signs of Spina Bifida such as the open spine. There are three different types of Spina Bifida – Spina Bifida Occulta, Meningocele, and Myelomeningocele (Meningomyelocele), also called Spina Bifida Cystica. It is often called “hidden Spina Bifida” because about 15 percent of healthy people have it and do not know it. Tethered cord can be an insidious complication that requires investigation by a neurosurgeon. his is the most severe form of Spina Bifida. This happens because fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord is unable to drain like it should. Without treatment, a person’s head grows too big, and may have brain damage. Children who do not have Spina Bifida can also have this problem, so parents need to check with a doctor. A surgery is done to close the opening immediately after birth. As the child gets older, these problems translate into physical disability, as well as dyslexia and other kinds of intellectual difficulties. Though she uses a wheelchair now, like me, she didn’t always. She used to get around well with the assistance of a walker, and she has always worn braces. I asked Kate to share some of her own knowledge and experiences of Spina Bifida. It was much more personal and helpful than anything I was able to find on a website. Because it was her first pregnancy and she had nothing to compare it to. Now they test for it. I’ve apparently always like to prove people wrong. Tell me I can’t do something and I will do everything in my power to prove you wrong. Big projects were hard because they require you to break them down into smaller parts and I never figured out how to do that. I always ended up scrambling at the last second to finish. I’ve had many situations where I was asked to do a list of things and only manage to remember one maybe two of the things I was supposed to do, and have to ask what else I was supposed to do. Talking to Kate and reading her answers, I found out so many things I had not known before, even through spending every day with her for years. Be careful, especially teachers, how you handle a child that doesn’t ‘fit in the mold’. Teachers can be a child’s greatest empowerers or their most destructive bulldozers. I started to get angry and frustrated, specifically about our school system, and how if you can’t cut it the way they lay it out, with reading and writing and math tests, you’re almost doomed for failure. That is where we have failed as a society. Do I know how to fix it? One person can’t change it. Again, I would leave what friends I had finally made, and be the new, awkward handicap kid that didn’t know anyone. That’s where I met Katie. I figured we at least had one thing in common, and if she didn’t seem friendly, she would just be one more person on the long list. She said she had Spina Bifida. I think that was the extent of our conversation that day, and I don’t really remember what happened between then and the day that we went to see Monsters Inc. with a group of new friends from Laliberte’s class, and her (now our) friend Katrina, but by that summer we were pretty much inseparable. Kelly and I have known each other since I was 9, and we have kept in touch and are still best friends despite everything life has thrown at us. And there is so much power and comfort in having someone that understands. Not just someone that believes you or even believes in you, but someone who understands. Because they’ve been there. So, in honor of Katie (aka Kate), I will be doing a Spina Bifida Awareness series for October; Spina Bifida Awareness month. But I am starting off with Kate’s answers to the Invisible Illness survey. Read on and stay tuned! But I had symptoms since: In the womb but nobody realized it. I know I’ll hit a point where I won’t have a choice but I want to postpone the inevitable for as long as possible. My illness has taught me: You can never truly know, or judge, what another person is going through. Stole this but I couldn’t have said it better myself. Want to know a secret? The nicest thing someone did for me when I wasn’t feeling well was: Lots of things. I’m going to get involved with Invisible Illness Week next year because: It’s important for people to pay attention to what other people are going through even if they can’t see it. I’m busy keeping up with Dora the Explorer, how I’m going to handle a baby from a wheelchair, and the drama of second grade. If I need to know something, I call my politically savvy cousin, Shekinah. Now, to be honest, when I first heard about Ms. Davis, I did not know what filibustering was. Even then, I wasn’t sure I had it right. For hours on end, without stopping, as a way to stall the political process, to stop a law from passing that you do not agree with. That couldn’t be right. So I called Shekinah, and I had understood correctly. *For the record, Shekinah believes that filibusters can be a useful tool when used correctly and when necessary, and I agree with her. For the record I do not agree with abortion, and therefore do not agree with Wendy Davis, but if we look past our disagreement, there is another issue at hand. If you are not able to stand for hours on end, your attempt will be unsuccessful. And we can’t wait until there is one to change this rule. I’m not saying that those rules should be done away with completely. These rules should be changed to support equality. In a country where we boast about our freedom and equality, “under any circumstances” should not be a phrase found in our government policies referring to physical ability. I met someone yesterday that I think may have changed my life with something she said, and she probably doesn’t even know it. I almost didn’t go, but since we were doing it to reach out to the community and as an act of kindness, I decided to go. After we arrived, a family arrived that I hadn’t met before. I told her that I liked her chair, and that it looked a lot like mine. The way she sat and her shorter stature made me wonder if she had Spina Bifida, so I asked her mom when she was off playing with the other kids. She does have Spina Bifida, which as I’ve mentioned, one of my best friends, Kate, has, so we got to talking. I’ve tried bringing my wheelchair in to do it, but the counters and stove are right at eye-level from my chair. Also, it’s hard to get around in the tight quarters in a wheelchair. And since in Mexico the women tend to spend a lot of their time cooking awesome food, I somehow feel like I’m not as good of a wife for not doing it. I was reluctant to participate. Twice? One of the girls offered to help me, but me cooking usually ends in tears, so I declined her help. Plus, I didn’t see much point in me sitting and directing her on what to do. My husband offered to help, so I decided to give it a shot. He was sweet and brought me some medicine and my wheelchair, and a coke and chocolate (that always calms me down). Somehow we finished it all, but I was in a lot of pain, and I will NOT be doing that again. Well, never say never; perhaps the trick is to not do it all in one day. It was a busy week, so it just worked out that way. In cases like this, I wish pain was visible. I wish they could see it and know. Because I chose to dry my tears and have a smile on my face when we arrived. Sometimes severe, sometimes not, but all the time. The truth is that I have a lot to smile and be happy about, and I think those things are more important. Some tend to think I’m making excuses or being lazy, or that when my family helps me with something, they are babying me. So what is frustrating is when other people question those limits. Kate had a similar incident on the same weekend, and I doubt we are alone in this. Okay, enough with my rant and tangent. The person didn’t mean it that way, cooking is just a sensitive subject for me. So simple, so silly, but in my world, so profound. I’ve never had anyone really understand before. Nobody ever just give me permission to spend the extra money on something that’s considered a luxury because, well, that’s what I need to do. So from now on, I’m going to do what I need to do. I’m going to eat out when I the pain is too much to stand, and I’m not going to feel bad about it. So I’m going to take care of myself, and not let other people be my guide. Little did I realize, becoming a grown-up didn’t mean you could make your problems go away, and sometimes, adults act just as badly as children. The kind that we think doesn’t exist anymore. The kind that we tell ourselves we would never take part in. I recently decided to stop spending time with the new girl from Florida that had befriended me. After chasing her and her new group around the schoolyard because they said they were running from ‘the weird kid’, and trying to convince them to stop, I finally figured out that ‘the weird kid’ was me. I decided to see what they were up to. A few of them glanced at me as I drew near, making worried expressions. Adrienne* walked over to me. Adrienne runs back to the group, relays the message, and comes back. They’re sending a messenger before I get too close? That is a true story. She was the first one to ever really be mean simply because I walked funny. Unfortunately, Tiffany was also in my 5th grade class, and she spread her disdain to other girls in the class. I have found that that is not necessarily true. The only person I knew at the party was the person who invited me. But I didn’t want to make that person feel bad, and I thought, just maybe, it would turn out to be a good time. When I arrived, we chatted for a minute, and then she went to socialize with other people. I sat awkwardly alone for a while, while everyone else was talking and laughing and having a good time. I’m in a room full of people, and I’m the only one sitting alone.” So I went to the table next to me and said hello, trying to make conversation. Big mistake. After a few sentences, we had pretty much run out of things to say. I decided that was my cue to leave, so I thanked the host and left. I have seen it too many times. Too many times have I struggled to prove that I am ‘a normal person’ in order to be included. This is only one example, but there are many more. No matter your abilities or inabilities. And you know, God is no respecter of persons. Another side to this is when people over-compensate. In this case, I don’t want my disability to change, I want the world’s view on people with disabilities to change. I’m not writing this post to get sympathy or throw a fit. A challenge to treat people as you would want to be treated. To recognize that people who walk differently or talk differently or have Down’s syndrome or autism are regular people on the inside, even if they appear differently on the outside. Even take it one step further and realize that someday, it could be you in that wheelchair. If it was you, would you want people to treat you differently than they do now? So I challenge you to take a stand for equality. Because equality is there whether we choose to recognize it or not. Just as I was rising to go home, she turned suddenly upon me, and said: ' Mrs. Brown, why do you come up at evening so near our house, and then go back without coming in? I could not think who it was, and sent my girl down the garden to see; and she said it was you. That you came to the fence, but, seeing her, turned quickly away, muttering \n\nMeg is a 52 year-old woman married and a mother to three children. She comes from a long family history of breast cancer with both her mother and older sister having been similarly diagnosed. She talks about the importance of getting second opinions and how that convinced her to have a lumpectomy followed by radiation versus a double mastectomy. Meg was lucky to have a strong network of friends and family that helped her through her journey. She now works for the Cancer Support Community to aid those less fortunate. Dr Williamson talks about why her medical career became focused on breast cancer following the loss of her sister to the disease. In her in-depth interview, she talks about the importance of radiation and how it significantly reduces the rate of recurrence for her patients. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's. My sister had breast cancer in her early 40's so I was a teenager when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I didn't know why she was going to the hospital. My parents didn't tell me and she had breast cancer. They told me that afternoon she had a single mastectomy. A year later she had a second mastectomy because the doctors back then said chances are if she had it on one side she's going to have it on the other so we're going to go and take the second one. And then a year later she had a hysterectomy and unfortunately for my mom she never really recovered from it all. But she was cancer-free for four or five years and then she had spinal cancer after that. The radiation zapped her spine so hard that she was handicapped the rest of her life and used crutches and a walker to get around and was never able to walk on her own again after the radiation. It had a huge impact on her emotionally, severe depression, and a really hard thing because none of us understood what was going on with her. None of us understood it. We thought once the cancer is over you should be fine but she had a really hard time coming out of it, never really did. I have a mammogram every six months and then I have a sonocine on the other six months and I've never missed an appointment and I never will. It 's just a range of all emotions and very confusing, lots of choices, lots of doctors to talk to, lots of questions, lots of answers, lots of opinions, so my choices were a lumpectomy with radiation or the mastectomy. I was told that my survival rates would be the same. I chose the lumpectomy followed by radiation, and actually the reason I made that choice was because another doctor had said to me, and it was the best advice I got, was just get the tumor out, just go ahead and schedule the lumpectomy, and then get to pathology, and then you can always go back and have the mastectomy afterwards. I followed this doctor's advice cause I was thinking I had to do either the lumpectomy or the mastectomy. And I did talk to every person I know who had breast cancer. I had a long phone conversation or lunch or dinner with every single one I had known who had it and what did they do; how did they make their choice; how did they make the decision; and I had a very good friend who had been diagnosed with the same kind of cancer I had just six months earlier, and she did the lumpectomy and radiation. That made perfect sense to me. My husband was with me every step of the way. You go into the room, change your clothes…you take your clothes off, you put your robe on, you go in. It's all very clinical. And then they lay you down on the bed and then the radiation starts and it doesn't hurt. And I was pretty good leading up to the start of radiation in terms of emotion. She said, I didn't think you'd do well with this, and she was right. My husband got up with our children every morning to get them ready for school so I got to sleep in every morning which was great. I was glad it was over but it was okay. My doctors were wonderful. Every doctor was amazing. The mammogram lab was amazing. The breast center doctors were amazing. And every doctor had time for me. They all gave me their cell phones…you call me anytime you have a question. These doctors were all…everyone was amazing. I was told the horses hadn't left the barn yet. After the pathology report came in and it turns out that the barn doors had actually opened, that the horses would have started to leave the barn had I waited much longer for the surgery, so knowing that I just felt so grateful that I was checked every six months and we acted on it right away. And because the horses had left the barn, I am on medication for five years. I did Tamoxifen for three years and now I take Femara every day, so I'm four years out. After I went through radiation, I did choose to have a hysterectomy because there were other signs happening. When they were giving me biopsies…my gynecologist was giving me biopsies..I thought I don't ever want to hear the word biopsy again, and when my gynecologist said if you get ovarian cancer there's nothing I can do for you, I said.. that's all he had to say to me is I said then let's do it. He didn't understand what was going on, and we didn't do a very good job explaining to him. He thought all this time that I still had the cancer and I just felt horrible. My husband and I looked at each other and just said how did we miss that one? It was really awful for him. They're very fatalistic about this for them with their grandmother, their aunt, their mother, which is the same way I felt about cancer. That it was a matter of time. I think if anything we've learned through all this that with early detection is it's going to be fine; it's going to be fine; and the girls just need to stay on it and get checked every six months like I have; never miss an appointment; do the self-checks; and just have to stay on top of it. Our parents' generation did not have the support that we have and they didn't understand how important the support is, the emotional support is, to have when going through something like this. It's just not something you can do alone, and my mom did kind of go through it alone, and we as the kids didn't understand what was going on and how it impacts everything from now on. And so, no, my mother did not have the support system that Cancer Support provides and she could have really used Cancer Support Community. She would have loved Cancer Support Community. She could have really used it. I love Cancer Support Community so much because we believe that nobody should face cancer alone, and I was blessed to have this incredible support system but not everybody has that great support system and you can't go through something like this alone; you can't do it; it's too hard.\n\nQuestion: who turned out to be the mother on how i met your mother\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Additionally, each province or territory operates its own corporate tax system, with varying treatment for small businesses. Before 2009, the rate of corporation tax was 22%. With effect from 1 January 2011, a new rate of 10% will apply to all companies except energy and utility providers, which will pay a 10% surcharge and thus incur a rate of 20%. Many tax incentives simply remove part or of the burden of the tax from business transactions. In Malaysia, the corporate tax rate is now capped at 25%. Nevertheless, a company eligible for a certain tax incentive might only pay an average effective tax rate of 7.5%, with only 30% of the company's profit being subjected to tax. There are a number of tax incentives given to entrepreneurs to encourage business growth and development. Therefore, many businesses have taken advantage of the various tax incentives available for their benefit. Good knowledge of these tax incentives has provided them ideas to effectively plan their business and investment strategies. As such companies have to seek expert opinions on all available tax incentives before they make their move to invest, because the incentives vary according to the business' structure.\n\nQuestion: what is the corporate tax rate in great britain\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Divergent was released on March 21, 2014, in the United States. The film received mixed reviews: although its action sequences and performances, notably Woodley's, were praised, critics deemed its execution and handling of its themes to be generic and unoriginal, and compared it unfavorably to other young adult fiction adaptations. A sequel, Insurgent, was released on March 20, 2015, in the United States and other countries. A third film, Allegiant, was released on March 18, 2016.

The third level of the hotel has a Sunset Lounge terrace that is available for dinners. Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars. Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels. Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization. In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes. These hotels may attract both business conferences and vacationing tourists and offer more than a convenient place to stay. These hotels may be referred to as major conference center hotels, flagship hotels, destination hotels, and destination resorts. These hotels as destinations may be characterized by distinctive architecture, upscale lodgings, ballrooms, large conference facilities, restaurants, and recreation activities such as golf or skiing. The hotel is a member of both The Leading Hotels of the World and Imperial Hotel, Ltd., marketing and trade associations geared toward luxury hotels.

First, as the sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, leading to the release of acrosomal enzymes. During this process, the heads of several sperm fuse with the zona pellucida. However, only one successful sperm will be able to penetrate the egg. This fusion of the sperm with the zona pellucida is known as the acrosome reaction, marking the completion of capacitation. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary changes in the sperm's plasma membrane, enabling the release of acrosomal enzymes. Upon penetration, the sperm sheds its body and tail, with only the head containing the genetic material entering the egg. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. Many sperm cells are released with the possibility of just one managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective layer surrounding the egg cell (ovum). In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote comes entirely from the egg cell. Sperm competition is the competitive process between spermatozoa of two or more different males to fertilize the same egg during sexual reproduction. Sperm competition is an evolutionary pressure on males, and has led to the development of adaptations to increase males' chance of reproductive success. Males \n\n• **Phase 2(b):** The acrosome fuses with the zona pellucida, thus completing capacitation.• **Phase 2(a):** The acrosomal enzymes are released, and penetrate the cumulus mass cells of the egg.First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. The sperm require from five to 10 hours of incubation in the fluids of the female reproductive tract to complete the acrosome reaction. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg. Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation.

It is a thin, highly vascularized, and pigmented layer that lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid supplies blood to the retina and helps nourish its cells with oxygen and nutrients. Lastly, there is the iris, which is the most anterior portion of the vascular layer. The iris also helps in protecting the internal structures of the eye. Overall, the components of the vascular layer of the eyeball work together to provide nourishment to the retina, regulate the amount of light entering the eye, facilitate accommodation for near vision, and maintain intraocular pressure. Vascular layer of the eyeball\\n\\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball consists of three continuous parts—the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris from posterior to anterior (Fig. It is a thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer consisting of smaller vessels adjacent to the retina and larger vessels more peripherally. Its components include the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes.\" The outer layer, called the corneoscleral coat or fibrous layer, consists of the sclera and cornea. The cornea, which is transparent, covers the anterior one-sixth of the eye and is continuous with the sclera. Moving inward, the middle layer is known as the vascular coat or uvea. The choroid is a highly vascular layer that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body, located behind the iris, is responsible for producing the aqueous humor and controlling the shape of the lens. The innermost layer is called the retina. It consists of the outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. In summary, the three concentric layers of the eye include the corneoscleral coat (consisting of the sclera and cornea), the vascular coat or uvea (composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris), and the retina (comprised of the outer pigment epithelium, inner neural retina, and ciliary body/iris epithelium). Reference:\n- The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats. The eyeball is composed of three structural layers: the corneoscleral coat, the outer or fibrous layer, the vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, and the retina, the inner layer. The external layer of the eyeball is composed of the sclera, which is the opaque tissue making up the \"white\" of the eye, and the transparent cornea located on the front of the eye. The sclera provides structural support and protection to the eyeball, while the cornea helps focus incoming light onto the retina. It contains many blood vessels that supply nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris and plays a role in secreting aqueous humor, which helps maintain the shape of the eye. The innermost layer of the eyeball is the retina. The retina also contains blood vessels and plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information to the optic nerve. The wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric layers.

His armed revolt had failed miserably, but as historian Cento Gomez stated, \"it was a ground breaking event in the history of Cuban struggle for independence.\" On August 12, 1851, he was shot by a firing squad of Spanish troops alongside three of his compatriots in Puerto Príncipe (today’s Camagüey province). Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on 24 February 1895, but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until 11 April 1895. His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero. He sought a revolution and Cuban independence from Spain, but also lobbied to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American and Cuban politicians desired. In October 1868, Cuban planter and sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes and his followers proclaimed independence for Cuba. In 1878, the Pact of Zanjón ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba. In 1879–80, Cuban patriot Calixto García attempted to start another war known as the Little War but failed to receive enough support. An exiled dissident named José Martí founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York in 1892. The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence from Spain. In January 1895, Martí traveled to Monte Cristi and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to join the efforts of Máximo Gómez.\n\nQuestion: the cuban revolt against spain was led by\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These markings, also known as \"tool marks,\" are created during the manufacturing process and can provide valuable information for forensic investigations and crime scene analysis. Primary markings are intentional, distinctive characteristics that are intentionally engraved or stamped onto a bullet during the manufacturing process. These markings can include the manufacturer's logo, brand name, or specific design features unique to a particular manufacturer. Primary markings help identify the firearm that fired the bullet and can narrow down the list of possible weapons used in a crime. These markings can include scratches, pits, or imperfections caused by the firearm's chamber, breech face, or extractor. By analyzing primary and secondary markings on a bullet, forensic experts can determine important information such as the make and model of the firearm used, its potential history, and potentially link it to a specific crime. Overall, primary and secondary markings on metal bullets play a crucial role in the identification of weapons, aiding in criminal investigations, and supporting the justice system. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel. This process, known as bullet matching or ballistics comparison, involves examining the striations, scratches, and grooves on the bullet's surface. Primary markings are the initial impressions left by the gun barrel, such as the rifling pattern and the number of lands and grooves. Secondary markings, on the other hand, are the additional imperfections that occur during the manufacturing process or due to wear and tear in the gun barrel. By examining and matching the primary and secondary markings on a metal bullet, investigators can potentially link the bullet to a specific firearm. It is important to note that while bullet matching is valuable in forensic investigations, it is not a foolproof method. Often such information (normally ranging marks) was etched onto equipment such as stiletto daggers or shovels. In 1782, the discovery was made by John Senebier that certain resins lost their solubility to turpentine when exposed to light; that is, they hardened. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel. By comparing the primary and secondary markings found on the bullet with those on the barrel of a suspected weapon, forensic experts can determine if the bullet was fired from a particular gun.

Modern adjustable beds use electrical motors to control movement, and often include extras such as heat and massage. Adjustable beds have in some shape or form been available for many years. They have their roots in the hospital industry, which long ago discovered the many advantages of adjustable beds. It was not until the 1960's that these devices became popular for the general consumer, and since the price has dropped while the quality has risen. There are many medicinal advantages that are associated with adjustable beds. Adjustable beds have been shown to improve circulation, help to ease lower back pain and tension, improve breathing conditions, help with acid reflux, and have many other benefits. Many of these advantages come from the ability to easily put yourself in the semi-fowler position. Of all the medical benefits associated with adjustable beds, perhaps the most intriguing is its help with combating acid reflux. This is where the advantage of owning an adjustable bed comes in. By sleeping with your upper body slightly elevated acid reflux can often be controlled, and when this is combined with some of the medicines available for acid reflux, it provides a powerful means of preventing and controlling acid reflux. Adjustable beds offer many other advantages that revolve around individual comfort and usability. They make it much easier to watch TV or to read books in bed. It is also much more ergonomic and practical to eat in bed with an adjustable bed. Whether you are purchasing your adjustable bed for one of the many of the medical reasons, to get a better nights rest, or for any of the other advantages associated with them, you will be amazed at the luxurious feelings associated with these beds. Bed-sharing is standard practice in many parts of the world outside of North America, Europe and Australia, and even in the latter areas a significant minority of children have shared a bed with their parents at some point in childhood. One 2006 study of children age 3–10 in India reported 93% of children bed-sharing while a 2006 study of children in Kentucky in the United States reported 15% of infants and toddlers 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing. Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night. Bed-sharing has been relatively recently re-introduced into Western culture by practitioners \n\n Records show the earliest duvets were made in China, around 3000 B.C. From Viking times, duvets of eider down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over Europe began buying and using such duvets. In the 17th century, Paul Rycaut was among the first to try and market the duvet in England. In the story The Princess and the Pea, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on 10 eiderdown duvets. In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise: \"There is one thing very particular to them, that they do not cover themselves with bed-clothes, but lay one feather-bed over, and another under. This is comfortable enough in winter, but how they can bear their feather-beds over them in summer, as is generally practised, I cannot conceive.\" 1. The bed has a safety feature which prevents rotation when the head is elevated above this angle. The Freedom Bed™, through its ability to provide frequent rotation, and complex positioning, addresses these conditions while improving comfort, independence, control, and quality of life. 3. How Does The Freedom Bed™ Work? Thus the bed-user is carefully cradled by the bed’s structure to prevent sliding and shear forces that can increase the potential of developing pressure issues. The bed then automatically rotates to the other side to complete the cycle. 4. 5. The bed can be programmed to stay in any of the positions (left, right or center) for a time period from 1 minute to 4 hours. This is commonly done by people who do not like, or are not able, to sleep flat on their backs, but prefer to turn from side to side. How Many Models of The Freedom Bed™ Are Available? Enhancements to the basic model include a variable height (High-Low) platform, Trendelenburg positioning and a unique air-powered head and leg elevation system that provides extremely comfortable seating while reducing seating pressure. 7. Does The Freedom Bed™ Have Electric Up and Down? 8. Does The Freedom Bed™ Sit Up? Models PAR3-A3F and PAR3-A3FX come equipped with the head and leg elevation system that allows the user to be in a full-sitting position and in an infinite number of different positions to suit his or her individual needs or preferences. Note: ProBed offers a longer model (PAR3-A3FX) of the bed for tall persons over 6’1”. 9. numerous medical reasons for requiring Trendelenburg and/or Reverse Trendelenburg positioning and such requirements should be discussed with your medical professional. The turning function of the bed is not affected by the angle of Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg selected. Does The Freedom Bed™ Have Side Rails? Recognizing that many users of the Freedom Bed™ spend many extra hours in bed, the rails have been designed to provide an optimum viewing area around the user and to minimize any feelings of containment. 11. In fact, the Freedom Bed™ runs on a 12-volt DC system that is “topped-up” as required by an automatic smart charge system to ensure that the batteries are always fully charged. The Freedom Bed™ has been designed with the user in mind and can best be described as “whisper quiet” when turning. Rotation is also exceptionally smooth allowing users to sleep through rotations and throughout the night providing them with a “good night’s sleep”. It provides many years of safe, comfortable and reliable service to users. What Kind of Mattress Does The Freedom Bed™ Have? This will keep the mattress in its preferred position while the bed is in motion. Each of the three sections of the mattress has its own zipper. Note that while the rotation provides very good pressure relief, the bed can be used with specialty foams, gel pads, Roho type inserts etc. The latest mattress design incorporates three densities of foam laminated together with 5 cm of viscoelastic foam on top, providing increased levels of pressure distribution and comfort. Visco-elastic foam was originally developed at NASA in an effort to relieve astronauts of the incredible g-forces experienced during lift-off. There is no extra charge for this mattress, but please let us know if your application will be in public building requiring this certification. In fact one of the compelling reasons for using the Freedom Bed™ is its user-friendly programming system that ensures extremely reliable and comfortable automatic rotation for the user and restful nights for family members and care-givers. Depending on the user’s personal circumstances he or she may be able to have full, or partial, control over the many functions of the Freedom Bed™. The following chart lists sizes and weights are for each model of the bed. Weights include mattress and woodwork. The bed is designed to be easily disassembled to allow it to be moved up stairs and elevators, and along hallways without problem. Also, the weight is much lower than many specialty beds, so no extra work to floors or doorways is required. The kit consists of a set of 2 wheels that bolt to the side of the bed, one at each end. The bed can then be turned on its side and rolled easily through any standard width door or hallway. When was the Company established and how long has The Freedom Bed™ been available? The company was established in 1989 and versions of the Freedom Bed™ have been marketed since 1994. The most recent versions of the Freedom Bed™, complete with their unique air-powered head and leg raising feature, have been available (and receiving “rave” reviews) since the spring of 2001. This bed is now available in Australia from DRP International Healthcare who have been established since 2002. The reason is that the Freedom Bed’s unique rotation system permits many people to live at home rather than in nursing homes or care facilities, as it solves a care-giving function that is too difficult for many family members due to age, physical strength or their own infirmity. It allows families to remain together and provides for the user and all family members to get a good, uninterrupted, night’s sleep which is a solid foundation for good health for all concerned. Persons with severe scoliosis. Persons weighing in excess of 158kgs. There are practical limitations on the beds ability to practically rotate larger individuals. What is the support capability of the bed? The bed is rated to support a person weighing up to 181kg. However, there are practical limitations on the beds ability to practically rotate individuals larger than 158 kg. What a pleasant surprise! All hire terms include Servicing, Maintenance and Safety inspections. As a computer-controlled full bed mechanical system, the bed is designed to last and provide many years of flawless and cost effective service. See Cost-Benefit Analysis http://www.pro-bed.com/products/cost-benefits.html What value do you place on reduced pressure injuries, less pneumonia, easier care-giving and good night’s sleep for patient and care givers? Many users, family members of users, case managers and other interested parties are very willing to talk about the Freedom Bed™ and its many benefits. The beds have regulatory approval in Canada and United States and Australia. The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in, evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment. Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the petit lever to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited. The other monarchs of Europe soon imitated his practice; even his staunchest enemy, William III of England, had his \"grooms of the bedchamber\", a signal honour. The state bed, a lit à la duchesse&mdash;its canopy supported without visible posts&mdash; was delivered for the use of Queen Marie Leszczyńska at Versailles, as the centrepiece of a\n\nQuestion: when did beds become popular in france and germany\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published. In this book, he described his theory of evolution by natural selection. The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\" Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. include paleontology, systematics and botany in a series of notable books: Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) by Ernst Mayr; Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and Variation and Evolution in Plants (1950) by G.

In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in Forest Grove, Oregon. The Department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound. The news about the noise was first shared with Dave Nemeyer by a Forest Grove resident, who posted a video of it on the city's Facebook page. The Washington Post described the noise as sounding like a \"giant flute played off pitch\", car brakes, or a steam whistle. NBC News described it as \"akin to a bad one-note violin solo broadcast over a microphone with nonstop feedback\". It reportedly lasts \n\n In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. Sometimes, just answering a few questions can help get the wheels turning, and highlight a few areas that might point to hearing loss. Is it difficult to understand one person's speech while there is background noise? 4. Do you find it difficult to understand the dialogue on TV unless you turn the volume up high? 5. Do you often need to ask others to repeat themselves? It's like trying to run with three or four feet of water; obviously, your legs are not going to be able to move as fast. With ears, it's the same thing: if the ossicles in the middle ear are under water, they will not be able to conduct high frequency sound as efficiently. That's why everything sounds muffled when you have a cold. It means that the nerves in the inner ear have suffered actual damage, which could be caused by aging, ear infections, or prolonged exposure to loud noise. But we can treat it, and the sooner we treat it, the better. What does the brain have to do with the hearing system? Your brain is responsible for interpreting sound, and just like the rest of your hearing system, your brain can be involved in hearing loss. Think about it this way: you can hear a foreign language spoken out loud, but if your brain doesn't understand that language, it will sound like noise to you. Understanding is the brain is part of the hearing system. If you go too long without being able to hear the world around you (due to conductive or sensorineural hearing loss), your brain may stop putting as much effort into understanding what you hear. If it gets out of the habit, then even hearing aids won't solve your ability to understand what people around you are saying. That's why it is so important to get hearing loss treated early, so your brain still retains all of its skill at understanding and interpreting sounds. What are realistic expectations of hearing treatment? But it's also important that you understand what to expect. In fact, it's a lot more likely that people you speak with will notice if you ask them to repeat themselves all the time. But it's important to stay on top of your hearing and address any problems as soon as you notice them to keep your brain healthy and give you peace-of-mind. If you have noticed that you're turning the volume of the TV up, if you're having to ask people to repeat themselves more often, if it seems like everyone around you is mumbling, it might be time to come have your hearing tested. [...] It was a very controversial method of recording, because when you have that many spaced omnidirectional microphones you lose a lot of the directional cues, which is absolutely right, the way that we would deal with that was we would pan the left and right tree half left and half right, and the outrigger mics we would pan hard left and \n\n Many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition, or more commonly known as psychoacoustics, in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects. The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics. This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one's foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene. In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music. By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.\n\nQuestion: who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek. The Finnic (Fennic) or more precisely Balto-Finnic (Balto-Fennic; Baltic Finnic, Baltic Fennic) languages, are a branch of the Uralic language family spoken around the Baltic Sea by the Baltic Finnic peoples. Traditionally, eight Finnic languages have been recognized. The major modern representatives of the family are Finnish and Estonian, the official languages of their respective nation states. The other Finnic languages in the Baltic Sea region are Ingrian and Votic, spoken in Ingria by the Gulf of Finland; and Livonian, once spoken around the Gulf of Riga. Unlike the languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group. As other Uralic languages, Finnish has vowel harmony, and like other Finnic languages, it has consonant gradation.\n\nQuestion: turkish finnish and hungarian belong to which family of languages\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Menstrual products are part of menstrual culture, as they are prominent in shops, through advertising and through disposal methods (such as sanitary bins and bags). There are environmental costs of using menstruation products containing plastic and chemicals. Not all cultures use menstrual products, opting instead for natural materials or homemade options. During their periods, women use various products to manage menstrual bleeding. Some common products include menstrual pads, tampons, and menstrual cups. Menstrual pads are placed on panties to collect the menstrual fluid outside of the body. Menstrual cups are soft cups usually made of medical-grade silicone and are shaped like a bell. Menstrual cups can be emptied, rinsed, and reinserted. If there are concerns or questions about menstrual products or menstrual health, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider for guidance and support. Menstrual product advertising began in the early twentieth century. Historically, menstrual product advertising has had to balance frankness and information with taboos and censorship laws against discussing or showing menstrual themes. Educational pamphlets and school outreach has been an important way of marketing to young consumers during the twentieth century One common way that sanitary-product advertising avoids depicting menstruation is by pouring a blue, rather than red, liquid on the sanitary product to demonstrate its absorptivity. Historically, this has been due to strict censorship rules regarding menstrual product advertising.

Before entering the war, the U.S. had remained neutral, though it had been an important supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and the other powers of the Allies of World War I. American soldiers under General of the Armies John Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), arrived at the rate of 10,000 men a day on the Western Front in the summer of 1918. When World War I broke out in Europe during the summer of 1914, the United States stuck to a strict policy of neutrality. On August 4, 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared to Congress that, \"The United States must be neutral in fact, as well as in name, during these days that are to try men's souls. On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary.

According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. This triggers a multiplier effect which draws the economy toward underemployment equilibrium. By the same token, strong demand results in unplanned reduction of inventories, which tends to increase production, employment, and incomes. If entrepreneurs consider such trends sustainable, investments typically increase, thereby improving potential levels of production. In the 1960s, Robert Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud did further work on effective demand, and in the 1970s Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman published a well-known model of spillover effects upon effective demand. The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial \"boom\". Mises stated that this artificial \"boom\" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called \"malinvestment\" - which eventually must end in a \"bust\". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment \n\nCasino gaming expansions can contribute to sustainable economic growth and diversification in a gaming-dominant economy through various mechanisms. This influx of revenue can lead to increased investment in infrastructure, public services, and other sectors, consequently creating jobs and generating income. By maintaining a balanced approach and leveraging the positive spillover effects, a gaming-dominant economy can achieve long-term stability and resilience. Capital formation, on the other hand, refers to the accumulation of physical and human capital through investments. This includes investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and technology, among others. It allows countries to take advantage of their comparative advantages and access larger markets, leading to increased economic growth. The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Proponents believe that a sustained period of low interest rates and excessive credit creation from fractional reserve banks result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment.\n\nQuestion: who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. Vodka, gin, baijiu, shōchū, soju, tequila, whiskey, brandy and rum are examples of distilled drinks. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth. The earliest known instance of the term \"moonshine\" being used to refer to illicit alcohol dates to the 1785 copy of Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. The U.S. Government considers the word a \"fanciful term\" and does not regulate its use on the labels of commercial products, as such, legal moonshines may be any type of spirit, which must be indicated elsewhere on the label.

A subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin. In this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. This type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. Other methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body. Medications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously. Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. If you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen. Dial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer. Dial the correct dose and prepare for your injection. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier. Inject the needle. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin. Insert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication. Withdraw the needle. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row. For example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage. What Is a Drug Allergy? A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. Medication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise. There are four methods in which the LD50 test is measured: Subcutaneous : Venom is injected into the fatty layer beneath the skin. The most commonly tested methods are subcutaneous and intravenous injections of mice. Subcutaneous is the most applicable to actual bites.

The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise.

The partially digested food, known as the bolus, then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. From the stomach, the chyme moves into the small intestine. It is responsible for breaking down food into its simplest forms, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. The nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream to various cells and tissues in the body for energy production and other functions. It is important to note that the absorption of digested food material occurs primarily in the small intestine, whereas the large intestine is involved in water reabsorption. The structures and organs involved in the digestive process, such as the stomach, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, each have specific roles in breaking down and absorbing food. Overall, the human body's ability to break down and absorb food is a complex process involving various organs, enzymes, and physiological mechanisms to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients for optimal function. Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\n The digestive system comprises a foregut, a midgut and a hindgut, and is situated dorsally. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus. They have a large surface area so there will be more efficient absorption of fatty acids and glycerol into the blood stream. Saliva also contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of cooked starch. This movement is facilitated by peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions to propel the food throughout the GI tract. Here, further digestion takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes, bile from the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine itself. These enzymes break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The small intestine is where most absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to various organs and tissues for energy and other functions. In summary, digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract involve the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and elimination of waste in the large intestine.\n\nQuestion: where are most nutrients absorbed in the human digestive tract\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). Ossification (or osteogenesis) in bone remodeling is the process of laying down new bone material by cells named osteoblasts. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the direct laying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while endochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. It is a process that occurs during ossification, but not necessarily vice versa. The exact mechanisms by which bone development is triggered remains unclear, but growth factors and cytokines appear to play a role. Endochondral ossification is one of the two essential processes during fetal development of the mammalian skeletal system by which bone tissue is created. Unlike intramembranous ossification, which is the other process by which bone tissue is created, cartilage is present during endochondral ossification.

An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team’s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell’s new team would be regarded as an expansion team. For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list. In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team in NFL history (2008 Detroit Lions) to suffer a 0-16 record. In 2020, the Browns won their first playoff game since their reactivation in 1999, defeating the division champion Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round. The team finished 5–11, fourth in the AFC Central, though most of the season was overshadowed by the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy. The team was documented in NFL Network's A Football Life. Despite taking the Browns to the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year, head coach Marty Schottenheimer was fired at the end of the 1988 season. As of 2020, this remains the last time the Browns swept the Steelers. The 2005 season was the Cleveland Browns' 53rd in the National Football League (NFL) and their 57th overall. However, the Browns failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third consecutive season. When the AAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in. The Browns went on to win three NFL championships, nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s, and won one more NFL championship in 1964.

As of 2018, there were 3050 acre under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing 3 e6USgal of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years. York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind California and Washington. It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley has the second-most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like New England. Michigan is the fourth largest grape-growing state in America, with over 13,500 acres of vineyards. Wine grapes represent 11% of total vineyard area. Michigan is one of the foremost U.S. states in the production of diverse varieties of bottled, fermented fruit wine.

A graph is simple if it has no self-loops and no multiple edges with the same endpoints. The number of maximal directed pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n &minus; 1)n.\n\n A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet. This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph.\n\nQuestion: an edge that is between a vertex and itself is a\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages. In Belgium, the justices of the peace (vredegerecht, justice de paix, friedensgericht) function as the small claims courts in the country's judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote Aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate. In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court).\n\nQuestion: what is the job of justice of the peace\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This was the first year in which the gold statuettes were called \"Oscars\". This was the second and last year that write-in votes were allowed at the Oscars. The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. Oscar stars Sylvester Stallone, in a rare attempt at a comedic role, as Angelo \"Snaps\" Provolone, a mob boss who promises his dying father that he will leave the world of crime and become an honest businessman. Its score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. According to Landis, Oscar was stylistically influenced by older Hollywood comedies, particularly those belonging to the \"screwball\" genre, that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. Oscar was released in the United States on April 26, 1991, and received mixed reviews from critics. The ceremonies were presided over by Johnny Carson. This also marked the first year that the award for Best Makeup was presented.

Ohio (1961). She argued that her right to privacy in her home, the Fourth Amendment, was violated by police officers who entered her house with what she thought to be a fake search warrant. In the Supreme Court case, Mapp v. Ohio, the decision was made in favor of Mapp, in a 6-3 ruling. As a result of the ruling in Mapp v. Ohio, Mapp's conviction was voided. A few years after Mapp v. Ohio was ruled upon, Mapp was convicted again, but this time for the possession of narcotics. In Mapp v. Ohio the Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional to use the evidence of pornography gathered from the police officers when they illegally searched Mapp's house. This realization of the Court is what allowed Dollree Mapp and her lawyer to make a \"motion to suppress\" the evidence. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. took the paper from Mapp. The officer found evidence of pornography in Mapp's house.

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher.

Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (Bleistift), Irish (peann luaidhe), Arabic (قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ), and some other languages \n\n Graphite, archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure. Graphite is used in pencils and lubricants. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. Today, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite.

As various organisms interact with the environment, DNA is expelled and accumulates in their surroundings from various sources. **DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits. **cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane. **cell** Smallest unit of an organism, typically but not always consisting of a nucleus and cytoplasm encircled by a membrane. Many microscopic organisms – such as bacteria and yeasts – consist of just one cell. Centrioles play a key role in cell division. Cloning occurs naturally: plants' and animals' body cells are ultimately clones of an original fertilized egg. **cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane. **DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits. DNA is found in the cells of all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. **gene** Unit of heredity, located on a chromosome.Genes consist of DNA, except in some viruses where they are made of RNA. single-stranded DNA (ssDNA): Any molecule that consists of a single nucleotide polymer, or \"strand\", as opposed to a pair of complementary strands held together by hydrogen bonds. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of each parent in equal amounts; this genetic material is known as the nuclear genome of the individual, because it is found in the nucleus. Comparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. eDNA can be captured from environmental samples and preserved, extracted, amplified, sequenced, and categorized based on its sequence.\n\nQuestion: where can you find dna in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Allosteric regulation refers to the binding of molecules to a site other than the active site of an enzyme, which can modulate its activity. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. A classical example of allosteric inhibition in biochemistry involves the regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) through the binding of citrate and ATP. Allosteric inhibition refers to the process in which the activity of an enzyme is regulated by the binding of a molecule to a specific site other than the active site. When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required. By binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function.\n\nQuestion: which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president. Members of the party are called \"Democrats\" or \"Dems\". The term \"Democrat Party\" has also been in local use but has usually been used by opponents since 1952 as a disparaging term. That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans. Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s with the election of Andrew Jackson. Since the nomination of William Jennings Bryan in 1896, the party has generally positioned itself to the left of the Republican Party on economic issues. The Democratic-Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe. The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party. It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party. Since the 1860s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party. Before 1860, the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs.\n\nQuestion: what caused the breakup of the democratic republican party\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman, premiered January 12, 2018, with Barack Obama as its first guest. Schmidt combined his documentary and comedy backgrounds as director and executive producer (showrunner) of Chelsea Handler's Netflix docuseries, Chelsea Does (2016), his third collaboration with Morgan Neville and first with Netflix. In each hour-long episode, Chelsea examines a different topic - marriage, Silicon Valley, racism, and drugs - through conversations with friends, family, and experts ranging from Los Angeles matchmakers to American civil rights activist, Al Sharpton. For his next project, Schmidt again took the lead with CBS' The Case of: JonBenet \n\n During the taping of his show on April 3, 2014, Letterman announced that he had informed CBS president Leslie Moonves that he would retire from hosting Late Show by May 20, 2015. It was announced soon after that comedian and political satirist Stephen Colbert would succeed Letterman. Letterman's last episode aired on May 20, 2015, and opened with a presidential sendoff featuring four of the five living American presidents, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, each mimicking the late president Gerald Ford's statement \"Our long national nightmare is over.\" Carlos has appeared as a special guest in \"Episode 253: Chuuch\" of the Keith and the Girl podcast. In the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor George Clooney and politician Jeb Bush, thanked former host David Letterman, and joined singer Mavis Staples and numerous other musicians for a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's \"Everyday People.\" The episode nearly missed its broadcast due to technical difficulties. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that November, Colbert devoted his program to that city.

When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force, in the event of oxygen shortage (hypoxia), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis. Some examples of metabolic pathways involved in ATP production include glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. It involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP. The pyruvate produced from glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it undergoes further processing in the Krebs cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the main pathway for ATP production. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain (ETC). As electrons pass through the ETC, energy is released and used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. These metabolic pathways work in concert to efficiently produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. The process is called photophosphorylation.\n\nQuestion: where does the formation of atp take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song samples the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus by Joseph M. Scriven, who wrote it in 1855 to comfort his mother in Iceland while he was living in Canada. On the song, Maher sings about the joy of our friendship with the Saviour. Aleteia described the song as \"switching gears from quiet worship to bouncing folk-rock, with a country-pop hook, where the piece is infused with a jubilant energy, which is aided by a perfectly employed gospel-ish choir.\" \"What a Friend\" is a song performed by Canadian contemporary Christian music (CCM) artist Matt Maher. These hymns include \"The Ninety and Nine\", \"Beneath the Cross of Jesus\", \"Hiding in Thee\", \"A Shelter in the Time of Storm\" and \"While the days are going by\". Here he experienced a spiritual conversion, which was described in print by Whitefield, attracting interest and criticism. Cruttenden wrote seven or so hymns, published after his death: 'And is it yet, dear Lord, a doubt?' 'Did Jesus die, but not for me?’ ‘I own my guilt, my sins confess;' 'Let others boast their ancient line;' 'Rise, Sun of glory, shine reveal'd;' ' 'Tis false, thou vile accuser, go;' 'What adverse powers we feel within.' Although the lyrics were originally composed, the music and melody of this adaptation resembled the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus, originally written by Joseph M. Scriven as a poem in 1855.\n\nQuestion: who wrote song what a friend we have in jesus\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

O'Donoghue knew about the surprise twist when production began as he kept hinting that there was a reason why they wanted to make sure that Emma and Hook had a happy ending. On December 3, 2015, the cast of the mid-season finale, \"Swan Song\", was revealed with Eric Keenleyside returning as Maurice, Belle's father and Oliver Bell being introduced as a Young Killian. On December 4, it was announced that Rachel Shelley would be reprising her role as Milah, Rumplestiltskin's ex-wife and Hook's ex-lover, for at least one episode in the second half of the season. Club gave the episode a B, noting that \"Hook has been one of the more delightful character reinventions on Once Upon A Time. The episode title “The Jolly Roger” refers to Hook’s efforts to get his boat back, his true love, but really the vessel is just a stand-in for his actual true love, Emma, who—due to yet another unfortunate curse!—seems farther away from him than ever by the end of the episode.\" The sixth episode of the season, \"The Bear and the Bow\", introduced Paul Telfer as Lord Macintosh, Marco D'Angelo as Lord MacGuffin and Josh Hallem as Lord Dingwall while the seventh episode, \"Nimue\", saw the introductions of Jason Simpson as Adda, Caroline Ford as \n\n of fiction, including Peter Pan. Robbie Kay played the main villain role during Season 3A as Peter Pan, portrayed in the series as the father of Rumpelstiltskin, and reprised his role in a couple episodes during Season 5B and the second-to-last episode of the overall show.

He performed for 45 minutes, making eight passes along the wire. Though Petit was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, he was later freed in exchange for performing for children in Central Park. The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest (and later release) of Petit, whose performance lasted for almost an hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments (with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present-day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man. Before its destruction, the World Trade Center was a New York City icon, and the Twin Towers were the centerpiece that represented the entire complex.

The UK copyright on the text of the original Winnie the Pooh books expires on 1 January 2027; at the beginning of the year after the 70th anniversary of the author's death (PMA-70), and has already expired in those countries with a PMA-50 rule. The illustrations in the Pooh books will remain under copyright until the same amount \n\n After Disney purchased the rights for Winnie the Pooh to make a 1966 animated short film, the company conceded to a broad licensing agreement with Sears, Roebuck & Co.. Stephen Slesinger Inc.'s Pati Slesinger found merchandise that Disney did not pay royalties on. In 1983, Disney paid Stephen Slesinger Inc. and the Milne estate to end the royalty issue and agreed to a new contract that lowered Slesinger Inc.'s royalty percentage. In 1979, the Intergovernmental Philatelic Corporation of New York was licensed by Walt Disney Productions to make Disney character stamps for several countries. He is credited with creating the image of Winnie the Pooh in his red shirt when he obtained exclusive rights from A. In exchange, Milne received 3% of sales and 15% to 50% of other Pooh rights Slesinger would commercialize. The deal included the rights to Winnie the Pooh, as well as the other now famous characters, such as Christopher Robin, Eeyore, Tigger and Owl. In the United States, copyright will not expire until 95 years after publication for each of Milne's books first published before 1978, but this includes the illustrations. In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2 million at auction in Sotheby's, London.

A motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. Anatomy and physiology\n\nUpper motor neurons \n\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories. According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy. In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate. In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle. All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.

In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, which is the cytoplasm. This process does not require extensive regulation and occurs in a simplified manner compared to eukaryotes. The RNA molecule produced, called messenger RNA (mRNA), is then immediately available for translation. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have their DNA enclosed in a nucleus, where transcription occurs. Transcription in eukaryotes requires the chromatin structure to change so that the DNA becomes accessible to RNA polymerase. Once the RNA molecule is transcribed, it undergoes additional processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns. This processed mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. The process of decoding the information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid until it reaches a stop codon, at which point the polypeptide chain is released. This problem was overcome in the 1960s by the use of reticulocytes in vertebrates, which produce large quantities of mRNA that are highly enriched in RNA encoding alpha- and beta-globin (the two major protein chains of hemoglobin). DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and information transfer in cells through a process called transcription. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is \"unzipped\" to expose the bases. The RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism. Molecular Biology of the Cell. During this process, DNA polymerase \"reads\" the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5′-to-3′ direction.\n\nQuestion: where is the protien made in the cell\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Description: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. Recovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.

Toyota took the lessons it learned from NUMMI and went onto establish the wholly-owned Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plants in 1986. As Toyota prepared to open more plants in 1996, the company created the Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) subsidiary in Erlanger, Kentucky to oversee all Toyota manufacturing operations in North America. Toyota– was the only domestic team to have won a stage in Tour of California and Tour de Georgia in 2006 and 2007. Son to the company founder, Toyoda, in 1952, joined his father's business at Toyota Motors. The merger of the sales and production organizations in 1982 produced Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyoda's leadership would be integral to the global introduction into popular culture of the Lexus brand of luxury automobiles and environmentally focused Prius engine electric hybrids. The Toyota ToyoAce is a light to medium cab over truck built by Toyota since September 1954. The \"Big Three\" of Japan (Toyota, Nissan, and Honda), each have luxury divisions: Honda's Acura (created in 1986), Nissan's Infiniti, and Toyota's Lexus (both created in 1989).

His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones's trademark throughout the band's career. Jagger gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements \n\n  In mid-1962, Watts first met Brian Jones, Ian \"Stu\" Stewart, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who also frequented the London rhythm and blues clubs, but it was not until January 1963 that Watts finally agreed to join the Rolling Stones.

The concerts featured backing vocals by Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards, something that the Stones would get away from beginning with their next tour when Richards handled the majority of the backing vocals himself. This gap-year from touring prompted Keith Richards to join Ronnie Wood on his 1979 United States solo tour, to promote his then-album Gimme Some Neck, in the process forming the band The New Barbarians. Nearly all rhythm and lead guitar parts were recorded by Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones' other guitarist and the primary songwriting partner of their lead singer Mick Jagger; together the two wrote all but one of the tracks on the album.

While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Paul was, before his conversion, an antagonist of the followers of Jesus. Initially he persecuted the \"church of God.\" Paul was in contact with this community. According to Dunn, this was not an \"usurpation of power,\" but a consequence of Peter's involvement in missionary activities. Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. Paul opposed the strict applications of Jewish customs for gentile converts, and argued with the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, where Paul met with the \"pillars of Jerusalem Church\" (whom Paul identifies as Peter, Jesus's brother James, and John) over whether gentile Christians need to keep the Jewish Law and be circumcised.

Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES. The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed. Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984). Nintendo licensed the Mario characters but was otherwise not involved in the game's development, nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993. The SNES version used audio and visual assets from Super Mario World. During the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials on video game mechanics were rare, and players instead were oriented to a new video game by its level design. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by directing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything players need to \"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\", to be able to play more freely, so that it becomes \"their game\". The service allowed Atari 2600 owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a phone line to a central server and rent a video game for 5–10 days. From 1987 to 2003, Nintendo's Japan-only Disk Writer kiosks allowed users to copy from a jukebox style of rotating stock of the latest games to their floppy disks. There were also examples such as Soft bender TAKERU for PCs, which also served as a distribution system for karaoke.\n\nQuestion: what was the first video game for nintendo\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Some blood types are far more common than others. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative. Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks do a test called a \"type and crossmatch\" on the donor's and the recipient's blood. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Generally, donors are not allowed to give blood more than once every 56 days. That is why health officials have restricted blood donor eligibility and made blood testing thorough. VIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.Hepatitis B remains the most common potentially serious disorder transmitted by blood transfusions, with a current risk of about 1 infection for every 137,000 units of blood transfused.AIDS\n\nIn the United States, donated blood is tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.

It is well known as the opening theme to the American TV show Cops and the theme song of the Bad Boys franchise. \"Hot Cop\" is a song by the American disco group Village People recorded for their third studio album Cruisin' (1978). It was written by Jacques Morali and Village People lead singer Victor Willis. It served as Willis' theme song with the Village People. The song featured in the 2009 film Paul Blart: Mall Cop, in which it was used as the main character's cell phone ringtone which prevented him from solving cases. \"Cops and Robbers\" is a single by English pop rock band the Hoosiers.

Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect. (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) In England and Wales, the powers to make building regulations were consolidated and re-enacted in 1984. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Prior to the Order, under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, all public and commercial buildings, and all non-single-household domestic dwellings (apart from houses in multiple occupation), were required to hold a valid fire safety certificate issued annually after an inspection by the Fire Service. This regime was replaced with assessment by third-party fire-risk assessors contracted by building owners and landlords, with no mandated timeframe for checks, and no mandated professional qualifications. Their powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation.\n\nQuestion: when did the the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005 first come into effect\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He has released twenty studio albums, many of which feature his backing band the E Street Band. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length. Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle \n\nThe Balham Alligators ; Gary U.S. Bonds and Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen had originally recorded the song for his 1980 album, The River, but it was never released and he decided to re-record the song with Bonds for his 1981 album, Dedication) . ; The Flatlanders ; Joan Baez included a recording of the song on her 1970 album (I Live) One Day at a Time. The title of the song is referenced in Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1991 song \"Down at the Twist and Shout\" and Adam Carroll's 2000 song \"Errol's Song\". The song is a tribute to two anarchists of Italian origin, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were sentenced to death by a United States court in the 1920s for the murder of a payroll clerk and a guard.

Those who have the formal power to create legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to interpret legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established. The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term legislation is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term primary legislation may be used to exclude these other forms.\n\nQuestion: a legislative act passed by congress is an example of\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These stimuli are then converted into electrical signals that travel along the axons of the sensory neurons and enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Once inside the spinal cord, the sensory information is processed and integrated with other signals before being transmitted to the brain for further interpretation and perception. It houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons and serves as a relay station for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. This segment allows the sensory information to be processed and integrated within the central nervous system. In this process, synapses occur only in the gray matter, which is where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located. Sensory neurons are classified as pseudounipolar neurons and have cell bodies located in ganglia along the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Reference: They have a single process that divides into a peripheral segment that brings information from the periphery to the cell body and a central segment that carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. Nuclei of the CNS are the morphologic and functional equivalents of the ganglia of the PNS. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located in the ventral (anterior) horn of the gray matter. Because the motor neuron conducts impulses away from the CNS, it is an efferent neuron. The axon of a motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, passes through the ventral (anterior) root, becomes a component of the spinal nerve of that segment, and as such is conveyed to the muscle. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in ganglia that lie on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipol. These nerve fibers play a crucial role in transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body. On the other hand, the gray matter forms an inner butterfly-shaped pattern surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. It contains the cell bodies of neurons as well as nerve fibers. The sensory neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia. It is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels. In areas where the gray matter contains many large motor nerve cells that control limb movement, the gray matter and spinal cord are considerably larger compared to areas where the gray matter contains motor neurons for the muscles of the torso. Reference: A cross-section through the lower lumbar region of the spinal cord is shown here. Afferent nociceptive fibers (those that send information to, rather than from the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.\n\nQuestion: where are unipolar neurons found in spinal cord\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After defeating 2-seed Memphis State in the national semifinals, Villanova met defending champion and ten-point-favorite Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, in the title game on April Fools' Day. The game has been called one of the greatest in the history of NCAA Tournament Championships. Villanova ended the 2016 season at 35–5 including the unanimous #1 ranking in the final Coaches' Poll (USA Today) while capturing their 2nd NCAA basketball championship trophy in the history of the program. In beating #3 seed Miami (AP #10), #1 seed Kansas (AP #1), #2 seed Oklahoma (AP #7) and #1 seed UNC (AP #3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years — since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats — to not only beat four top-three \n\n The 2012–13 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Villanova was led by head coach Jay Wright, who was in his 12th season. This was Villanova's final season as a member of the original Big East Conference. The 2014–15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They defeated Marquette, Providence, and Xavier to win the Big East Tournament. Led by consensus First team All-American Senior Kerry Kittles, who became and remains Villanova's all-time leading scorer, the highly ranked Wildcats made their second appearance in the NCAA Tournament since the departure of Rollie Massimino.

These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. Almost all domestic and light commercial (e.g., offices) power is low voltage for regulation purposes. ; High voltage:Any voltage in excess of low voltage; usually found in industrial processes and electricity transmission and distribution networks. ; Extra-low voltage (ELV): 50 V AC or 120 V ripple-free DC, or less. ; Separated extra-low voltage (SELV): Extra-low voltage system that is also electrically isolated. A separate earth conductor will normally be supplied in both cases but may not be present depending on the connection type. Safety considerations in such high voltages require speaker line installation within conduit in most of the world. Special-purpose transformers capable of handling 1250 watts down as low as 50 Hz are available. One problem with high power, high current transformers is that fewer can be used on a single constant-voltage line.

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer–Vinson syndrome or Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome). Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

The facial skin may be dry, exfoliative (flaking) or erythematous. ; Facial palsy (weakness and altered sensation of the face). Signs and symptoms may include: The enlargement of the tissues of the mouth, lips and face seen in OFG is painless. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is where OFG occurs with fissured tongue and paralysis of the facial nerve. Angular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing.

Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue).

In November 1497, a fleet of Portuguese ships under the command of the Portuguese mariner Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope. Da Gama's fleet proceeded northwards to Zanzibar and later sailed eastwards, eventually reaching India and opening the Cape Route between Europe and Asia. Vasco da Gama visited Mombasa in 1498.

A meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by the Ottoman Empire, and rivalry with the Italian states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to India.

Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. Artificial digestion is a laboratory technique that reduces food to protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and non-nutrient compounds for analytical or research purposes. Digestive agents such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid are typically used to accomplish artificial digestion. The end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. In the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. GI Physiology Carbohydrates Digestion and Absorption. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion. To protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield.\n\nQuestion: in what part of the digestive tube do you expect the initial digestion of starch\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Researchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb. \"Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy,\" she told Reuters Health. Her new study included 272 preemies being treated at 11 NICUs that had music therapists. At different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played. They found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds. Sucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics. Previous research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care. There were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music. They said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available. \"The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over,\" Loewy said. Loewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well. \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.The sounds used in BioAcoustics are created by frequency generating and filtering equipment, which patients listen to either in a sound room or through headphones. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning\n\nFor nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains. From the general practice nurse to the ICU nurse, lung sounds tell you a great deal about a patient and their relative health. For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition. What was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema. – Listening for lung sounds. Wheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Stridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction. A pericardial rub and a pleural rub will often sound similar, and the best way to distinguish between the two is to make the patient hold their breath. We are going to listen to the heart over the valves, and nothing more. Now, if you hear a murmur over the valve… we are getting somewhere. You know there are four valves in your heart: aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral. The mitral valve is relatively easy to find if you are used to taking an apical pulse. The first sound you hear in the cardiac cycle is the “lub,” and it is a sound full of meaning. It is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing as the body empties the ventricles into the lungs and body. It is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing. Occasionally, you may hear a “split” S2 that sounds like “du-dub.” This is the aortic valve closing slightly before the pulmonic valve and is often a normal sound heard on inspiration. To hear a ventricular gallop, or S3, you should listen over the mitral valve with the bell. It will sound like a weird plopping noise right after you hear the “dub.” The whole heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Kentucky’. This heart sound can indicate heart ischaemia or heart failure. However, it is a normal sound in young adults under 30. S4 is the heart sound for atrial gallop, and the heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Tennessee’. Listen over the mitral valve with the bell of the stethoscope. You will hear the plopping noise just before the “lub” starts, which means it happens right before systole starts. This heart sound can tell you quite a bit. It is heard after heart attacks, and can indicate aortic stenosis, ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension. They will often sound like the words “rush” or “hush” and can last throughout the heartbeat. The above sample is of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) holosystolic heart murmur, caused by a opening in the dividing walls of the left and right heart ventricles. Most nurses carry out a cursory listen for bowel sounds, but you may not realise how variable and important these sounds can be. Instead of really focusing on the sounds, you may simply write down what you think you hear. For instance, the absence of bowel sounds after a surgery can indicate an ileus before the patient starts vomiting or complaining of abdominal pain. For this reason, it is important to go over bowel sounds once more, pay closer attention to them, and not use them merely as a stepping stool to the next level of assessment. You should know the structures within each area to help determine what the bowel sounds mean. Knowing the structures under your stethoscope will help you determine the nature of the bowel sounds. Although you can listen for vascular sounds over the abdomen, such as abdominal aortic bruits, most of the time you are listening for the sounds of the bowels themselves. To chart an assessment finding of no bowel sounds, you need to listen over the quadrant for at least five minutes. You should also do your auscultation before palpation and percussion to avoid influencing bowel sounds. Hypoactive bowel sounds could indicate a problem, so if you are having trouble hearing them this is significant. Hyperactive bowel sounds, on the other hand, may indicate stomach upset, cramping and anything that is increasing peristalsis. Hypoactive bowel sounds in the right upper quadrant could indicate a bowel obstruction there. Auscultating bowel sounds can allow you to pinpoint areas where an obstruction may have occurred. Finding no bowel sounds can mean an ileus, or an obstruction above that area of the intestine. Hypoactive bowel sounds are considered as one every three to five minutes, and this can indicate diarrhoea, anxiety, or gastroenteritis. Hyperactive bowel sounds are often found before a blockage. It is quite common to find one quadrant with hyperactive bowel sounds and one with none or hypoactive ones. You may also hear high-pitched sounds and rushing noises. It is important to chart the location, quality, intensity, and frequency of bowel sounds to document the GI system completely. Most nurses default to bowel sounds active in all four quadrants, but you need to be aware that this may not always be the case. A harried and hurried nurse may perform a quick assessment, but bowel sounds are a great indicator of the overall health of the patient. While everyone knows to listen for bowel sounds, that isn’t the only way to assess this important part of the anatomy. However, you should probably listen to bowel sounds before manipulating the stomach as this can cause changes in the way the sounds are heard. By slowing down assessment and giving the abdomen the time and attention it needs, nurses can notice problems that may get past even the most experienced doctors. This short video provides a four-minute overview of things to remember when performing a nursing assessment of bowel function in a palliative care setting. In very thin people, you will be able to see the movements of peristalsis, but you may also be able to see abnormal pulses of the descending aorta. Percussion of the abdomen can’t tell you nearly as much as the other forms of assessment can, but it can shed some light on what’s going on under that tissue. To percuss, you place two fingers over an area and knock on your fingertips with the fingertips of the other hand. This will allow the sound to travel through the tissue. In the case of masses, percussion will sound different from normal bowel tissue. Most bowel sounds are rather hollow and empty, but a mass will have a thicker, duller sound. Blockages will sound different as well, and if you are unable to hear bowel sounds in a quadrant, it may be worth percussing over the area, searching for a blockage. When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound. Listening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the 5th most unpleasant sound is that of nails scraping against a blackboard (listen). Listen to the sound of a ruler on a bottle, the 4th most unpleasant sound in the study. The 3rd most unpleasant sound is that of chalk on a blackboard (listen). The 2nd most unpleasant sound is that of a fork scraping against a glass (listen), according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the number one most unpleasant sound is that of a knife scraping against a bottle (listen). Chorus—Arise!

Physiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. All muscles in the body are affected. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

In 1980, \"O Canada\" was adopted as the national anthem and \"God Save the Queen\" became, by convention, the Royal Anthem, for use as a musical salute to the sovereign in person or as a display of loyalty in any circumstance. The United Kingdom's national anthem is \"God Save the Queen\" but its constituent countries and Crown Dependencies also have their own national anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, each has a number of anthems which are played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. It was composed in 1860 by then 25-year-old Prince William Charles Lunalilo, who later became King Lunalilo. Written by Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family. In January 2021 the lyrics were changed again. \"God Save the Queen\" is the royal anthem of Canada. The song has been used in Canada since the era when it was a collection of British colonies and \"God Save the King\" (or \"God Save the Queen\" during the reign of Queen Victoria) was played in honour of the British monarch. After \"O Canada\" was in 1980 proclaimed the national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\" has been performed as the royal anthem, in the presence of the Canadian monarch, other members of the Royal Family, and as part of the salute accorded to the Governor General of Canada and provincial lieutenant governors, as well as on other occasions.\n\nQuestion: when did god save the queen became the national anthem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. ten-hour workday. On March 26, 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, which was \"signed by one thousand citizens of New York and Brooklyn.\" The ten-hour workday would not be implemented until March 31, 1840, when President Martin Van Buren finally mandated a ten-hour workday for all mechanics and laborers employed on public works.\" In 1848, the yard had 441 employees who typically worked a ten hour day, six days a week.

Unlike the South Pole, the North Pole is not located on a continental landmass but in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

The T1100 PLUS is a later model of this laptop, released to the market in 1986. 1989, Apple released the Macintosh Portable, it weighed 7.3 kg and was extremely expensive, costing US$7,300. At launch it was one of the most powerful laptops available, but due to the price and weight, it was not met with great success, and was discontinued only two years later. That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta supercomputer, which had 512 microprocessors. The Toshiba Satellite series was discontinued in the United States in 2016 because Toshiba has exited the consumer laptop market in that country. However, Toshiba is still selling business-oriented Portégé and Tecra in many countries, and continues to sell the Satellite brand. The IBM 5100 Portable Computer is a portable computer (one of the first) introduced in September 1975, six years before the IBM Personal Computer, and eight before the first successful IBM compatible portable computer, the Compaq Portable. It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center in 1973. When the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, it was originally designated as the IBM 5150, putting it in the \"5100\" series, though its architecture was unrelated to the IBM 5100's.

With 13 episodes, it is currently the shortest-running series in the Scooby-Doo franchise to date. It premiered on September 10, 1983, featuring the return of Daphne, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program made up of two eleven-minute short cartoons. Thirteen half-hour episodes, composed of twenty-four separate segments were produced under the New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo title in 1983, and thirteen more episodes, composed of twenty separate segments were produced under the name The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984. At the time, Margaret Loesch, who served as supervising executive for the series, also worked for another animation production company, Marvel Productions. The original format of four teenagers and their dog(s) solving faux-supernatural mysteries for a half-hour was eschewed for simpler, more comedic adventures that involved real supernatural villains (the villains in previous Scooby episodes were almost always regular humans in disguise). A total of 33 half-hour episodes, each of which included three 7-minute shorts, were produced over three seasons, from 1980 to 1982 on ABC. Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season. Out of the 99 shorts that were produced, 86 of them feature Scooby-Doo, his nephew Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy without the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, and the other 13 only feature Scrappy-Doo and Yabba-Doo. The original thirty-minute version of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo constitutes the fourth incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo.

Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system. Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry. Even though agriculture was valued by social and religious practices; some experts noted that various government regulations were seen as an impediment in advancing agroforestry. Another aspect for the need of an agroforestry policy was the lack of the forest and tree cover in India. According to the Forest Survey of India in 2019, the country had 80.7 million hectares of forest and tree cover, which accounts to 24.56% of the total geographic area in the country; however, the country requires one third (33.3%) of its land under forest and tree cover, according to the National Forest Policy. Tolerant breeds produced 20-25% higher yields than indigenous strains when planted in the rural districts of Maharashtra. One of India's strategies, responsive crop monitoring, cannot be planned. While the government is working to create systems to guide farmers in specific situations, response farming depends on the direction of climate change. Farmers and their unions conducted protest rallies in Gujarat, Amritsar and Muzaffarnagar against the demonetisation as well as against restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on district cooperative central banks which were ordered not to accept or exchange the demonetised banknotes. Demonetisation resulted in the relative erosion of agricultural wages and weak bargaining power of farmers for their produce.

Under this plan, the 22 teams played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. The Finals were originally scheduled for June, but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus. On November 28, 2015, he started at small forward against the Sacramento Kings in place of the injured Harrison Barnes. On January 8, 2016, he scored a season-high 20 points on 8-of-9 shooting against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Warriors would again face the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2020–21 NBA season was the Celtics' 75th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the regular season for the league began on December 22, 2020 and featured a 72-game schedule rather than the typical 82-game schedule.

Despite this, the Federal Government can assess a 10% penalty on highway funds for states which choose to set their drinking age lower than 21. Less than a year after the Supreme Court ruling, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age. In the United States, the legal drinking age is currently 21. Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption.\n\nQuestion: when was the drinking age set to 21\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide, high-energy electrons, and ATP. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2 and provides the chemical energy driving the process. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.\n\nQuestion: how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is located at the base of the brain and is where the optic nerves partially cross over. This crossing allows for a specific arrangement of visual information to be transmitted to different areas of the brain. These optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where some fibers from each nerve cross over to join fibers from the opposite side. This crossing over of fibers has important implications for how visual information is processed in the brain. After crossing at the optic chiasm, these fibers continue their journey along pathways known as optic tracts towards specific regions in the brain responsible for processing visual information. The majority of these fibers go to a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in thalamus, which acts as a relay station before sending signals to other parts of the brain involved in vision, such as primary visual cortex. As the nerve fibers pass through the lamina cribrosa sclerae they lose their medullary sheaths and are continued onward through the choroid and retina as simple axis-cylinders. When they reach the internal surface of the retina they radiate from their point of entrance over this surface grouped in bundles, and in many places arranged in plexuses. Most of the fibers are centripetal, and are the direct continuations \n\nvisual purple. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain. A pathway consists of an optic nerve, the fibers of an optic nerve traveling through the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, and optic radiations terminating in an occipital lobe. Each optic nerve contains fibers from only one retina. The optic chiasm contains fibers from the nasal parts of the retinas of both eyes; these fibers cross to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe. Thus the optic tracts, occipital lobe, lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus, and optic chiasm each contain nerve fibers from both eyes. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain.

It contains the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1569, the dome over the church of Madonna dell'Umiltà in Pistoia was completed by Giorgio Vasari at the behest of Cosimo I de' Medici, over a building designed and built by others. Although clearly referencing Florence Cathedral visually and in the use of two shells, structurally the octagonal dome is similar to the much earlier dome of Florence Baptistery and the hemispherical shape of Michelangelo's design for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan), famous for the mural of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci is an example of the progression of architecture beyond the Gothic period and towards the Renaissance. Outside of the church is a large Monument to Cardinal Niccolo Forteguerri, depicting the standing cardinal, sculpted by Cesare Sighinolfi. The interior decorations and design included contributions by some of the major figures of Baroque art in Rome. The polychrome main altar, which includes alabaster frames, may have been designed by Bernini. Beginning in Florence, the style spread to Rome and Venice and made the combination of dome, drum, and barrel vaults standard structural forms. Notable architects during the Italian Renaissance were Filippo Brunelleschi, builder of the dome of Florence Cathedral, Donato Bramante, Andrea Palladio, and Michelangelo, designer of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.

Cnidarians range in size from a mere handful of cells for the parasitic myxozoans through Hydra's length of 5 - 20 mm, to the Lion's mane jellyfish, which may exceed 2 m in diameter and 75 m in length. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Predators of cnidarians include: sea \n\n In 2020 researchers working off the coast of Western Australia came across an Apolemia which had coiled itself into a spiral form. This would make it longer than any other animal on the planet, if one includes colonial animals, although individuals of the lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) are known to be nearly as large; the largest known specimen of the latter had tentacles as long as 37 m and was projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75 m, making it one of the longest extant non-colonial animals. Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean. The Japanese spider crab (Arthropoda: Macrocheira kaempferi) is one of the world's largest arthropods. ; The lion's mane jellyfish (Cnidaria: Cyanea capillata) is the largest known type of jellyfish. Their tentacles can reach up to 190 feet long, and they may have a bell diameter of almost 7 feet. ; The giant squid (Mollusca: Architeuthis dux) comes from the family Architeuthidae. Cassiopea (upside-down jellyfish) is a genus of true jellyfish and the only members of the family Cassiopeidae. The medusa usually lives upside-down on the bottom, which has earned them the common name.

Its advance into Germany was soon repulsed but its Galician campaign was more successful. In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front. Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \"Mitteleuropa\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front. In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort. offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the Eastern Front. Using short, intense \"hurricane\" bombardments and infiltration tactics, the German armies moved nearly 60 mi to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the result was indecisive.

In the NBA this rule is applied only in a throw in scenario. A five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession. The line defense was the catalyst of the future 3-2 zone defense. The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds.

At all levels of play, after three seconds the player is assessed a three-second violation which results in a turnover. In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a defensive three-second violation, which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock.

Clevedon Pier is a seaside pier in the town of Clevedon, Somerset, England on the east shore of the Severn Estuary. It was described by Sir John Betjeman, as \"the most beautiful pier in England\" and was designated a Grade I listed building in 2001. The pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to South Wales. The pier is 312 m long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head. Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson & Co., eventually taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. The present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow & Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Constructed predominantly from concrete-clad steel, it is 1026 ft in length and ends in a three-tiered pier-head, featuring a cafe, bar, lounge, and fishing decks. A notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was over 100 ft shorter. In 2018, the pier underwent restoration at a cost of £500,000, in addition to installing more than 300 m of gas mains supply, as the pier's own gas supply had developed problems. The works coincided with the 60 year anniversary of the pier's official opening.

Music journalist Paul du Noyer believes that Charlie Patton's \"Ain't Goin' Down That Dirt Road\" may have been an influence on the song. Paisley told The Tennessean that the song idea come from his own upbringing near the Ohio River: \"My best memories with my grandfather are on that body of water, and my dad, and learning to ski. It's kind of like a back-to-basics song, which is really an inner tube and a boat and you've got a theme park.\" Paisley debuted the song at the 2014 Academy of Country Music telecast on April 6. Crowell adjusted the tempo of the song and added instrumentation from session musicians such as Ilya Toshinsky and Jenee Fleenor. Hunt has said that the song is possibly his favorite song off his album Southside. Wendy Hermanson and Billy Dukes of Taste of Country wrote of the song that \"the overall result isn't 100 percent a traditional country song.\n\nQuestion: who sings that aint no way to go\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On January 24 Kentucky traveled to Columbia to defeat South Carolina 58 to 43. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. Kansas marched through the NCAA tournament, beating Midwest Region number one seed Indiana in the Regional Final to advance to the Final Four for the second time in three years. Though Kansas eventually finished at 29–7 with a loss to North Carolina in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance that year earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament where they defeated New Mexico State in the second round before losing in the third round to cross state opponent, Wichita State. The Jayhawks 40–72 loss to Kentucky is the fewest points scored by Kansas in a game since the introduction of the shot clock in the 1985–86 season.\n\nQuestion: who beat university of virginia in basketball this year\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Twenty-one countries presented their films at the \"First Cannes International Film Festival\", which took place at the former Casino of Cannes. During the first festival, the jury was made up of one representative per country, with French historian Georges Huisman as the Jury President. The 58th Cannes Film Festival started on 11 May and ran until 22 May 2005. The Palme d'Or went to the Belgian film L'Enfant by Dardenne brothers. The 59th Cannes Film Festival was held from 17 to 28 May 2006. Twenty films from eleven countries were in competition for the Palme d'Or. Paris, je t'aime opened the Un Certain Regard section of the festival. The festival takes place in mid-October. The festival, nicknamed \"Cannes on the Mississippi\", features national and international feature films and short films. The festival had one off-year when New Orleans suffered the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. the festival had grown into an internationally respected annual event that attracts 20–25,000 people, 400+ filmmakers, and 240 films. The 15th Cannes Film Festival was held from 7 to 23 May 1962. During the Cannes Film Festival of 1961, Robert Favre le Bret, Artistic Director of the Cannes Film Festival, with the agreement of the French Union of Film Critics, had decided to establish the International Critics' Week during the next Festival.

The following is a list of characters introduced in the show's fifth year, by order of first appearance. In what remains one of the serial's most dramatic and influential years to date, 1964 saw no less than four producers take the helm of the show. Apart from a short month-long break in which original producer Stuart Latham took over for one last stint, Margaret Morris presided over Coronation Street until May, in which she introduced Irma Ogden (Sandra Gough) in late January. The programme was conceived by scriptwriter Tony Warren. Warren's initial proposal was rejected by the station's founder Sidney Bernstein, but he was persuaded by producer Harry Elton to produce the programme for 13 pilot episodes, and the show has since become a significant part of British culture. The show premiered its 10,000th episode on 7 February 2020, and celebrated its 60th anniversary later that year. New series include Shameless, new episodes of popular soap operas Coronation Street and EastEnders and the original UK version of The Weakest Link which have not otherwise been screened in Australia.

A pair of Tornado GR4s left Cyprus armed with laser-guided bombs, supported by a Voyager aerial refueling tanker. Ultimately, the aircraft did not locate any targets requiring immediate air attack and so gathered intelligence for coalition forces instead. The Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted its first airstrike on 30 September 2014. A pair of Tornado GR4s engaged an ISIL heavy weapon position and an armed pickup truck using a laser-guided bomb and air-to-surface missile. On 3 October 2014, the RAF deployed two additional Tornado aircraft to bring its deployed fleet up to eight aircraft. The Squadron also operated eight aircraft from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus as part of Operation Shader, the coalition strikes against the extremist group ISIS. In August 2014, the squadron deployed three Tornados equipped with the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod and the Litening III targeting pod to N'Djamena in Chad for Operation Turus, to take part in the search for Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram. In December 2013, it was announced that following the squadron's scheduled 2014 deployment to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, it was to stand down on 31 March 2015 as a Tornado squadron at Marham, and reactivate the following day (1 April 2015) as a Eurofighter Typhoon squadron at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland.

Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak. German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural. The German language has several different ways of forming the plural. Sometimes the stress in the plural form is changed, for example der Muslim → die Muslime. It has strong and weak verbs. German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, Austrian, and Swiss Standard High German.\n\nQuestion: how many strong verbs are there in german\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. \"In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity.\" It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.\" But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.\" British journalist James Bartholomew claims to have originated the modern usage of the term \"virtue signalling,\" in a 2015 Spectator article. His 2015 formulation described virtue signaling as empty boasting (directly or otherwise): \"No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. There was a time in the distant past when people thought you could only be virtuous by doing things... involve effort and self-sacrifice.\" Merriam-Webster editor Emily Brewster describes virtue signalling as an academic-sounding counterpart to the term humblebrag, a term coined by Harris Wittels in 2010.\n\nQuestion: where does patience is a virtue come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The resolution was moved by Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq (Abul Kashem Fozlul Hôk) (26 October 1873 – 27 April 1962), often called Sher-e-BangaL, passed on 24 March and had its signatures from the Founding Fathers of Pakistan.

This event spurred the installation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network in 1969 to monitor regional earthquake activity. St. Helens and other Cascade Volcanos leading up to the deadly May 18 eruption and in the years following. The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years. There is also evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake. This fault runs from northern Vancouver Island, west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, up to the Gulf of Alaska. Because this quake occurred before the modern surface wave magnitude scale was developed and widely implemented, this earthquake may have only had the same overall intensity as the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. In future there may be some research done to compare the two earthquake events. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, a megathrust earthquake that occurred along the Pacific Northwest coast from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia which reached magnitude 9 on the Richter magnitude scale. The shock was located in the area between Olympia and Tacoma, and was felt throughout the state, as well as parts of Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. It is the largest recorded earthquake to occur in the Puget Sound region of Washington. In 2005, he published a book with others, \"The Orphan Tsunami of 1700,\" that summarizes the evidence for an 8.7–9.2 megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest on 26 January 1700, known as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.\n\nQuestion: what is the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the pacific northwest\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird. Athletes from the United States were the most successful, winning 103 medals during the games, 41 of which were gold. By total medals, they also fell behind the Russian Olympic Committee, and the United Kingdom. It was the most successful Summer Olympics in the country's history. The United States competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. At the closing ceremony, a segment of American culture was performed, as the country hosted the next Olympics in Atlanta. The Americans greatly improved compared to the 1988 Olympics mainly due to the break-up of the Eastern Bloc. The United States of America (USA) was the host nation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

This report defined a turning point in sustainability discourse since it deviated from the earlier limits-to-growth perspective to focus more on achieving social and economic milestones, and their connection to environmental goals, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable development interconnects three socially concerned systems—environment, society and economy—a system seeking to achieve a range of goals \n\n Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choices and decisions. Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Something which is sustainable will not use more natural resources than the local environment can supply; more financial resources than the local community and markets can sustain; and will have the necessary support from the community, government and other stakeholders to carry on indefinitely. It is one of the key concepts in international development, and is critical in removing dependency on overseas aid. Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future.\n\nQuestion: when did the term sustainability start to be used\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Currently, no range-wide threats to chitals are present, and they live in many protected areas. Hunting for the deer's meat has caused substantial declines and local extinctions. The axis deer is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh. The chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Alabama, Point Reyes National Seashore in California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Texas in the United States, and the Veliki Brijun Island in the Brijuni Archipelago of the Istrian Peninsula in Croatia. CWD is a fatal, transmissible neurological disease that affects members of the deer family, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose. Colorado Division of Wildlife personnel recently found out just how indestructible prions are when they tried to eradicate CWD from a contaminated facility. Here’s another reason for people who don’t live in rural areas to fear prion diseases like CWD: Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the University of California at San Diego and UC-San Francisco, found that people with CJD have the prions in their eyes. Where do prion diseases come from? Captive deer operations are a main source of CWD due to their concentration of animals, “communicability window” (from trophy stock trading and escaped animals) and questionable feed sources. In a four-part expose, the Indiana Star revealed how “the pursuit of deer bred for enormous antlers and shot in hunting pens” on trophy farms is spreading CWD at an alarming rate. In the mid-1960s, the Department of Wildlife ran a series of nutritional studies on wild deer and elk at the Foothills Wildlife Research Facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Soon after the studies began, however, Foothills deer and elk began dying from a mysterious disease. It turns out that the deer may have developed CWD as a result of being held at the same facility with sheep that had had scrapie, a fatal, degenerative prion disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats. Can you get Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by eating CWD-infected deer meat? The official position of Departments of Natural Resources (DNR), which depend on revenue from deer-hunting licenses, is that humans can’t get CJD from eating venison from deer infected with CWD. The study, “Fatal Degenerative Neurologic Illnesses in Men Who Participated in Wild Game Feasts,” found numerous cases of hunters and/or men who ate venison who had developed CJD. They tell hunters not to eat a deer’s brain, eyeballs, spinal cord, spleen and lymph nodes. • Avoid eating venison, especially if it comes from “farmed” deer fed animal waste. • Avoid any meat that comes from a factory farm. Factory farms often feed confined animals slaughterhouse waste, or rendered animal protein. This practice is prohibited in organic meat production. • Call for an end to game farms. Deer breeding and “trophy farms” are a $4-billion/year industry. Farmers operate canned “hunts” in which bucks with trophy antlers can fetch six figures. Customers are guaranteed a kill, and the animals are sometimes drugged. Deer farm operators also sell antlers, velvet, urine and meat. • Protest the widespread trapping and killing of wolves. • Call on the CDC to require autopsies on people whose death certificate reads “Alzheimer’s disease” or “dementia.” Many of these people, especially deer hunters, actually have died from CJD but are buried or cremated with no disclosure. Allow wolves to eat the deer. I think I’d rather have deer infected than wolves. Principal photography began in Bragança, Portugal,  while additional scenes were shot in Norway, and Mammoth Lakes, California. In order to combat the film's low budget, the variety of creatures that appear throughout the film are only shown in glimpses or merely implied, the film's low budget also limited the amount of production crew the filmmakers could hire, which, according to Stewart, only consisted of three other people, including himself \n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD), sometimes called zombie deer disease, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting deer. In the US, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, caribou, and moose. In addition, CWD has been found in one Minnesota red deer farm, one wild reindeer herd in Norway (March 2016) as well as in wild moose. Single cases of CWD in moose have been found in Finland (March 2018) and in Sweden (March and May 2019, September 2020). CWD was found in South Korea in some deer imported from Canada. No relationship is known between CWD and any other TSEs of animals or people. Williams performed necropsies on deer and elk that had died of an unknown syndrome. It read in conclusion that \"Although no association between (animal) CWD and (the feastors in Wisconsin who happened to have) CJD was found, continued surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk for CWD transmission to humans.\" Quebec farm outbreak\nThe MFFP ministry in Quebec practiced 9500 tests in the period between 2007 and autumn 2018 before they detected a seropositive case in September 2018. The September 2018 discovery of CWD on a managed operation in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge Quebec prompted a wholesale slaughter of 3500 animals in two months before the enterprise shut down permanently. The CFIA ordered the cull, as well as the decontamination of 10 inches of soil in certain places on the 1000-acre operation. Other Quebec producers lamented the glut of supply. A 400 km quarantine area was declared, in which all hunting and trapping activities were banned. The government slaughtered hundreds of wild animals over a two-month period. When the producer was forced to close, the weekly slaughter neared 500 animals per week. From one CWD-infected herd in Alberta, 131 elk were sold for human consumption. For the fall 2019 hunting season in western Quebec, the provincial ministry relaxed the rules for the annual white-tailed deer (WTD) hunt, in an effort to curb the spread of CWD. Any WTD can be hunted with any weapon in certain municipalities in the Outaouais valley and the Laurentides. The quarantine around Grenville was still in place, and the ministry specifically prohibited (only) the \"removal\" from the quarantine \"enhanced monitoring area\" zone of \"the head, more specifically any part of the brain, the eyes, the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils, any part of the spinal column, the internal organs (including the liver and the heart), and the testicles.\" Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease. Exposure between animals is associated with sharing food and water sources contaminated with CWD prions shed by diseased deer. Other cervid species, including caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets. Introduced for the 2019 Minnesota hunting season, a no-cost deer carcass-incineration program was rolled out by Crow Wing County officials hoping to stem the spread of CWD in the region. CWD was found among wild deer in Crow Wing County for the first time in January 2019. The voluntary program encourages both residents and visiting hunters to bring harvested deer carcasses to the county landfill east of Brainerd, Minnesota for incineration and disposal. Running a bioassay, taking fluids from animals in the deer family suspected of infection and incubating them in transgenic mice that express the cervid prion protein, can be used to determine whether the cervid is infected, but ethical issues exist with this, and it is not scalable. A tonsillar biopsy technique has been a reliable method of testing for CWD in live deer, but it only seems to be effective on mule deer and white-tailed deer, not elk. Epidemiology\n\nNorth America\nThe disease was first identified in 1967 in a closed herd of captive mule deer in contiguous portions of northeastern Colorado. The limited area of northern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and western Nebraska in which free-ranging deer, moose, and/or elk positive for CWD have been found is referred to as the endemic area. It is also found in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The affected animal was a white-tailed deer killed by a hunter. The first positive farmed-elk herd in the United States was detected in 1997 in South Dakota. Since then, additional positive elk herds and farmed white-tailed deer herds have been found in South Dakota (7), Nebraska (4), Colorado (10), Oklahoma (1), Kansas (1), Minnesota (3), Montana (1), Wisconsin (6), and New York (2). As of fall of 2006, four positive elk herds in Colorado and a positive white-tailed deer herd in Wisconsin remain under state quarantine. All of the other herds have been depopulated or have been slaughtered and tested, and the quarantine has been lifted from one herd that underwent rigorous surveillance with no further evidence of disease. CWD also has been found in farmed elk in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. A retrospective study also showed mule deer exported from Denver to the Toronto Zoo in the 1980s were affected. In June 2015, the disease was detected in a male white-tailed deer on a breeding ranch in Medina County, Texas. State officials euthanized 34 deer in an effort to contain a possible outbreak. In February 2018, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks announced that a Mississippi deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease. Species that have been affected with CWD include elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, and moose. By April 2016, CWD had been found in captive animals in South Korea; the disease arrived there with live elk that were imported from Canada for farming in the late 1990s. In the summer of 2018, cases were discovered in the Harpur Farm herd in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec. More than 8% of Alberta deer were deemed seropositive. Europe \nIn 2016, the first case of CWD in Europe was from the Nordfjella wild reindeer herd in southern Norway. Scientists found the diseased female reindeer as it was dying, and routine CWD screening at necropsy was unexpectedly positive. The origin of CWD in Norway is unknown, whereas import of infected deer from Canada was the source of CWD cases in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and deer into the country. Norway has a scrapie surveillance program since 1997; while no reports of scrapie within the range of Nordfjella reindeer population have been identified, sheep are herded through that region and are a potential source of infection. In May and June 2016, two infected wild moose (Alces alces) were found around 300 km north from the first case, in Selbu. In 2017, the Environment Agency of the Norwegian government released guidelines for hunters hunting reindeer in the Nordfjella areas. The guidelines contain information on identifying animals with CWD symptoms and instructions for minimizing the risk of contamination, as well as a list of supplies given to hunters to be used for taking and submitting samples from shot reindeer. In March 2018, Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA stated that the first case of CWD in Finland had been diagnosed in a 15-year-old moose (Alces alces) that had died naturally in the municipality of Kuhmo in the Kainuu region. Before this case in Kuhmo, Norway was the only country in the European Economic Area where CWD has been diagnosed. The moose did not have the transmissible North American form of the disease, but similar to the Norwegian variant of CWD, an atypical or sporadic form which occurs incidentally in individual animals of the deer family. In Finland, CWD screening of fallen wild deer has been done since 2003. The export of live animals of the deer family to other countries has been temporarily banned as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of the CWD, and moose hunters are going to be provided with more instructions before the start of the next hunting season, if appropriate. The export and sales of meat from deer will not be restricted and moose meat is considered safe to eat as only the brain and nervous tissue of infected moose contains prions. A 16-year old emaciated female moose was found in the municipality of Arjeplog in the county of Norrbotten, circling and with loss of shyness towards humans, possibly blind. The moose was euthanized and the head was sent for CWD screening in the national CWD surveillance program. A second case of CWD was diagnosed in May 2019, with very similar case history, about 70 km east of the first case. This second case, in the municipality of Arvidsjaur, was also an emaciated and apathic 16-year-old female moose that was euthanized. The circumstances of these Swedish cases are similar to the CWD cases in moose in both Norway and Finland. A minimum of 6 000 deer are to be tested, both free-ranging animals in the deer family, farmed red deer, and semi-domesticated reindeer. A fourth case of CWD in moose was verified in September 2020, in a euthanized 14-year-old lame and unshy female moose in the municipality of Robertsfors, in the county of Västerbotten, approximately 200 km from the previous moose cases in the neighboring county of Norrbotten.

The Western Coalfield has been hit much harder by acid rain regulations. Whereas about half of Eastern coal is high in sulfur content, nearly all Western coal falls into this category. In recent years the state government has been seeking to land so called \"coal to gas\" operations that convert coal into liquid fuels that closely resemble either natural gas or petroleum. coal to oil and gas for their energy needs, and the industry yet again experienced a downturn. By 2001 8.36 billion tons of coal had been extracted from Kentucky, 5.78 billion tons coming from the Eastern Coalfield and 2.58 billion tons coming from the Western Coalfield. The state supplies 10.6% of the country with coal for power plants, giving it the nation's second-largest market share. Arguably coal's biggest economic impact has been low electric rates in Kentucky, which gives the state a competitive advantage in attracting industry, including those with heavy energy demands such as aluminum smelters and automotive plants.

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was to be implemented in two $350 billion authorizations. The first $350 billion went primarily to the Capital Purchase Program primarily allocated under the direction of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson an appointee of George W. Bush. The new Barack Obama appointee, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, announced the Capital Assistance Program on February 10, 2009. Another responsibility of the program is identifying which securities can be pledged to the government for collateral and determining how these securities are valued. By the end of the program it loaned out U.S. Treasury securities worth $2.3 trillion to just eighteen Wall Street banks. This was one of many emergency lending programs of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, these purchases were to have no impact on the balance sheet, and would have been sterilized by Treasury sales by the SOMA desk. On December 1, Chairman Bernanke provided further details in a speech. On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the program would be expanded by an additional $750 billion in purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities. Specifically, the program is responsible for the issuance, servicing and redemption of U.S. Savings Bonds and marketable Treasury securities. The program currently is focused on supporting Treasury's goal of effectively managing government finances by positioning Treasury to eliminate new issues of paper savings bonds and improving service quality and efficiency for customers.\n\nQuestion: what new deal program limited production in industry\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. The president and vice president of the United States are formally elected by the Electoral College. The Constitution gives each state the power to appoint its electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,\" with all states currently using some form of popular election. The electors are \"appointed\" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs \"on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.\" Winners of the popular vote in State elections usually get all of the electoral votes, but there is no legal requirement for a state to use a first-past-the-post system.

He served as Secretary of State for the state of Tennessee from 1862 to 1865, having been appointed by Andrew Johnson, the state's military governor under the Union Army occupation during the Civil War. Johnson traveled to Washington to be sworn into office, although according to Gordon-Reed, \"in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville.\" He was also governor of Tennessee from 1853 to 1857. The Tennessean governor was not entitled to many powers at the time, but used the position to publicize his views. Cheatham was elected during the Reconstruction era as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, serving from 1869 to 1871. His district included Davidson County as well as Robertson, Cheatham and Montgomery counties.

Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. In April 1991, during the negotiations between the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front to end the Salvadoran Civil War, an agreement was reached to reform various articles of the Constitution. One of these reforms was the conversion of the Central Electoral Council into the Supreme Electoral Court, and the addition of the two non-partisan members onto the makeup of the Court. The first challenge the new Court faced was the 1994 Salvadoran general election. Whilst the International Foundation for Electoral Systems' observers found that \"the El Salvador voting process was conducted in an orderly, peaceful and transparent fashion which permitted the popular will of the Salvadoran people to be expressed\", concerns were \n\n1) The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years with no re-election but he can be elected after sitting out one electoral period. ; 2) The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are: The political framework of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic with a multiform, multi-party system. The 1950 constitution of El Salvador established a Central Electoral Council (Consejo Central de Elecciones, CCE) as the \"highest authority of electoral matters\". However, this structure was criticised as leading to electoral processes falling under the control of the executive branch, and led to accusations of political bias. El Salvador elects its head of state &ndash; the President of El Salvador &ndash; directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority. Salvadorans also elect a single-chamber, unicameral national legislature &ndash; the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador &ndash; composed of 84 members (deputies).\n\nQuestion: what type of political system does el salvador have\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Also, given the marked prevalence of aluminum beverage cans, we suspect that the inadvertent aspiration of can tabs is more common than indicated by the paucity of published reports. In 2010, approximately 20 states authorized and or licensed the use of pull tabs. In Minnesota as well as some other states, pull tabs are offered nightly from vending booths often called jar bars.

The unexpected sales increase, combined with wanting to differentiate the packaging from Bud Light, were factors in the decision, with some consumers even stating that Miller actually improved on the taste when nothing changed in the beer itself.

Among counties whose population contains a non-Hispanic white majority, Clay County was once the poorest by per-capita income and second to another county in the same Kentucky region, Owsley County, by median household income. However, in recent years the economic status of Clay County, Kentucky has improved relative to other lower income counties. Due to the low volume of water, and the nutrient and pollutant rich drainage from the urbanized area surrounding the lake, water quality has been a concern, with the county developing the Lake Seminole Watershed Management Plan to protect water quality and habitat.

The innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual. Additional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3. The unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function. Loading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading. Primary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle. The ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction. Vleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver. After loading, the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, but posterior to the acetabula causing a posterior pelvic rotation and creating a dynamic, balanced tension on the pelvic ligaments. The sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to injury through minor and major trauma with an anterior shift in the line of gravity causing an anterior rotation of the innominate bones on the sacrum with a reversible subluxation and fixation. The opposing forces created when the ligaments are loaded create a force couple. The weight of the superincumbent trunk anterior to the oblique sacral axis at S3 on the left causes a sacral movement anteriorly at S1 on the left and posteriorly at S3 on the right just as soon as the normal axis on the symmetric pelvis begins to move into asymmetry. The sacrotuberous ligament is helical and allows this movement. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus serves to assist and support the function of the sacrotuberous ligament in bringing the distal sacrum anteriorly and laterally as the sacrum moves from lateral flexion to its resting position when the pelvis moves to symmetry at mid-step. This is necessary because the superincumbent weight is all anterior to the sacral axis and the sacrotuberous ligament is on stretch. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus and the piriformis must act as prime movers on the sacroiliac joint when the pelvis is asymmetrical. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus also functions to pull the pelvis anteriorly over the loaded side until the leg is perpendicular at mid-step. Dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint will cause at least some dysfunction in all of these pelvic axes. Other than when loading and moving from recumbent to standing, normal sacral movement occurs during normal gait. When the pelvis moves obliquely to the line of travel in order to extend the length of the stride it moves from a position of symmetry into asymmetry. In this position the pelvic bone (innominate bone) on the side of the forward leg (the loading leg) rotates somewhat backward and downward on the sacrum while the pelvic bone on the side of the trailing leg rotates somewhat forward and upward. This movement on the sacrum causes the sacrum to flex laterally toward the side of loading. As the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, the sacrum then moves on that oblique axis to drive counter rotation of the trunk on the loading side in order to decrease the loading forces and protect the head of the femur. This is a controlled instability and it can only occur with movement in the sacroiliac joint. Many practitioners believe that the sacroiliac joint does not move more than just a few degrees. Most practitioners accept Sturesson's measurements as accurate, leading to the myth that the sacroiliac joint essentially has no movement and no important function. In order to view innominate movement on the oblique asymmetric pelvis it was necessary to have the front of the pelvis square to the camera, but oblique to the line of travel. Movement of the posterior superior iliac spines on the sacrum is obvious and much greater than reported. Clearly, there is ample movement at the sacroiliac joint and not minimal as is commonly believed. Sturesson did not have the pelvis in an oblique or asymmetrical position nor did he include counter rotation. Conclusion: The sacroiliac joint demonstrates ample movement during normal ambulation when the pelvis is oblique to the line of travel and with counter rotation to the right and left. In the human body, the lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments is a pair of ligaments stretching from the lower lateral angles of the sacrum to the transverse processes of the first coccygeal vertebra. the joint between the sacrum and the coccyx. They complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve There are up to three lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments on either side of the sacral hiatus. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion. SI joint dysfunction is sometimes referred to as \"sacroiliac joint instability\" or \"sacroiliac joint insufficiency\"  due to the support the once strong and taut ligaments can no longer sustain. The sacroiliac joint itself often will not show degenerative changes, such as arthritis, until many years of the dysfunction being allowed to continue. Injury to the ligaments that hold the sacroiliac joints in proper support is thought to be caused by a torsion or high impact injury (such as an automobile accident) or a hard fall, resulting in the hypermobility. This is thought to result in the ilium and sacral surfaces \"locking\" in an incongruent or asymmetrical fashion (one innominate bone is tilted anteriorly; the other innominate bone is tilted posteriorly) causing pain that can be debilitating. Pelvic joint pain in post pregnancy women is thought to be derived from the inability of the stretched out ligaments to return to normal tautness. Certain biomechanical or muscle length imbalances may ultimately predispose a person to sacroiliac dysfunction and pain. Likely, this is a result of altered gait patterns and repetitive stress to the SI joint and related structures. These conditions exist in persons with leg-length inequality, scoliosis, a history of polio, poor-quality footwear, and hip osteoarthritis. Hypomobility\n\nPathological hypomobility (too little movement) of the sacroiliac joint is an intra-articular disorder in which the joint locks due to wearing down with age or degenerative joint disease. Pathophysiology\nThe sacroiliac joint is a true diarthrodial joint that joins the sacrum to the pelvis. The sacrum connects on the right and left sides to the ilia (pelvic bones) to form the sacroiliac joints. The pelvic girdle is made up of two innominate bones (the iliac bones) and the sacrum. The innominate bones join in the front of the pelvis to form the pubic symphysis, and at back of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac (SI) joints. Each innominate bone (ilium) joins the femur (thigh bone) to form the hip joint; thus the sacroiliac joint moves with walking and movement of the torso. In this joint, hyaline cartilage on the sacral side moves against fibrocartilage on the iliac side. The sacroiliac joint contains numerous ridges and depressions that function in stability. These can all be a source of pain and inflammation if the SI joint is dysfunctional. The sacroiliac joint is highly dependent on its strong ligamentous structure for support and stability. The deep anterior, posterior, and interosseous ligaments resist the load of the sacrum relative to the ilium. The long dorsal sacroiliac ligament can become stretched in periods of increased lumbar lordosis (e.g., during pregnancy). Affected muscle groups\nMany large and small muscles have relationships with the ligaments of the sacroiliac joint including the piriformis (see “piriformis syndrome”, a condition often related with sacroiliac joint dysfunction), rectus femoris, gluteus maximus and minimus, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, thoracolumbar fascia, and iliacus. Any of these muscles can be involved or spasm with a painful and dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. The SI joint is a pain-sensitive structure richly innervated by a combination of unmyelinated free nerve endings and the posterior primary rami of spinal segments L2-S3. Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction can also develop tightness and dysfunction in the hamstring, quadriceps, iliotibial tract (see “iliotibial band syndrome”) and hip flexors, including the psoas muscle. Diagnosis\nPerhaps the biggest reason for misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is based on the inability of common radiological imaging to discern the disorder. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain emanating within the sacroiliac joint. Pressure should then be directed downward on the leg in order to achieve hip extension and stress the sacroiliac joint. Iliac Gapping Test - Distraction can be performed to the anterior sacroiliac ligaments by applying pressure to the anterior superior iliac spine. Pressure is applied downward to the uppermost iliac crest. Then, downward pressure is applied to the medial knee stressing both the hip and sacroiliac joint. The examiner provides either a quick thrust or steadily increasing pressure through the line of the femur. The pelvis is stabilized at the sacrum or at the opposite ASIS with the hand of the examiner\nCautious interpretation is warranted because there are no biomechanical studies showing that the Thigh Thrust test isolates forces in the SIJ when performed at 90 degrees and due to intra-individual variation in body type, hip flexibility, general flexibility of the trunk and pelvis. The current \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction emanating within the joint is sacroiliac joint injection confirmed under fluoroscopy or CT-guidance using a local anesthetic solution. Published studies have used at least a 75 percent change in relief of pain before a response is considered positive and the sacroiliac joint deemed the source of pain. Misdiagnosis\nIn the early 1900s, dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint was a common diagnosis associated with low back and sciatic nerve pain. However, research by Danforth and Wilson in 1925 concluded that the sacroiliac joint could not cause sciatic nerve pain because the joint does not have a canal in which the nerves can be entrapped against the joint. The biomechanical relationship between the sacroiliac joint, the piriformis muscle (see “piriformis syndrome”), and the sciatic nerve had not yet been discovered. The ligaments in the sacroiliac are among the strongest in the body and are not suspected by many clinicians to be susceptible to spraining or tearing. Skepticism of the existence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction within the medical community is furthered by the debate on how little or much the sacroiliac joint moves. Surgery is often considered a last resort, but for some patients, it is the only method of effectively stabilizing the loose joint. A fixation of the joint (screws or similar hardware only, without the use of bone grafting) is more common than a spinal fusion, as it is much less invasive, surgically straightforward, and results in a quicker recovery time for the patient. Some experts in the field believe that it is important to make sure the sacroiliac joint is in an anatomically correct position prior to fixation or fusion, but published research contradicts this belief.

Therefore sacroiliac joint dysfunction may contribute to lumbar, buttock, hamstring or groin pain. Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. The fascia and muscles within the region provide significant self bracing and self locking to the SI joint and its ligaments through their cross like anatomical configuration. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia. Broadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Sacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint.

It is generally oval or cylindrical in shape, with significantly fewer locules (seed compartments, usually only two) than standard round tomatoes and a generally higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing into paste. **Canker sores.Researchers theorize that lycopene—a powerful antioxidant—is the natural cancer-fighting agent in tomatoes. The best way to get lycopene is in tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato juice, and even ketchup. Lycopene is most concentrated in tomato paste. Tomatoes also contain a compound called chlorogenic acid, which may help guard against cancer by blocking the effects of certain environmental toxins—for instance, nitrosamines, cancer-causing compounds in tobacco smoke and cured meat. This may be partially responsible for tomatoes' protection against heart disease. 50% more lycopene is contained in a Crimson type of tomato vs. a regular tomato. ** An unidentified substance in tomatoes and tomato-based products can cause acid reflux, leading to indigestion and heartburn. #### _Eating Tips_\n\n• | Add sliced tomatoes to a breakfast egg sandwich. ---|---  \n• | Bake sliced tomatoes, breadcrumbs, parmesan and garlic into a ready-made pie crust. While raw tomatoes contain lycopene, cooked tomatoes actually provide more lycopene per gram. To maximize the absorption of fat-soluble phytonutrients present in tomatoes, it is recommended to add a small amount of fat to your meal when consuming foods like tomatoes. Tomato juice concentrate is also a rich source of potassium, which can help decrease the risk of stroke. Additionally, tomatoes and other vegetables contribute to reducing oxidation when consumed with meals. Tomato products, such as paste, can be a healthy addition to family dinners by incorporating vegetables and providing essential nutrients. While tomatoes have not been found to suppress tumor cell growth in most cancers, the lycopene present in tomatoes may have a protective effect against prostate cancer and cervical cancer.

During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\n Shortly after the Stockton and Darlington Railway in England opened (1825) he visited it and observed George Stephenson's Locomotion in operation and acquired two of his engines, which however proved unreliable in French conditions. Cornishman Richard Trevithick is credited with the first realistic design for a steam locomotive in 1802. Stephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named Blücher after the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher (It was suggested the name sprang from Blücher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at Waterloo). The wagon way was used for hauling coal for 50 years. ; 1814 - George Stephenson constructs his first locomotive, Blücher for the Killingworth wagonway. It could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4 mph (6.4 km/h) but was too heavy to run on wooden rails or iron rails which existed at that time. ; 1822 - Stephenson's Hetton colliery railway was the first purpose built railway not to use animal power, instead using stationary engines, inclines and purpose built steam locomotives. ; 1825 - Stephenson's Stockton and Darlington Railway was\n\nQuestion: when did the first train run in england\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The state of war was announced to the British public in an 11 AM radio broadcast by the prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty on 3 September 1939, the day that the United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany. He succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister on 10 May 1940 and held the post until 26 July 1945. Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British re-armament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As prime minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy. On 3 September 1939, Britain and France, which were allied with Poland, declared war on Germany. The British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. At last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead. World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response.\n\nQuestion: when did the united kingdom entered world war 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Price described Yearwood's performance as \"beautiful and flawless.\" \"I Will Survive\" is a song by American singer Gloria Gaynor, released in October 1978 as the second single from her sixth album, Love Tracks (1978).

It was set to music by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as \"that horrible little lamb – a poem that I hate\". It was also given a setting by Sir John Tavener, who explained: \"The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday.\" American poet Allen Ginsberg set the poem to music, along with several other of Blake's poems, in 1969 and was included on his album Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake. ”Queen Mary's Song” is a song written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1889.

Deloitte's survey identified three trends:\n\n Companies such as ET Water Systems (now a Jain Irrigation Systems company), GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America. Advances in technology and automation such as 3D printing technologies have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States, both cost effective and possible. Adidas, for example, plans producing highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.\n\n To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return. A 2012 series of articles in Atlantic Magazine   highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the USA's manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the US, increasing US labor productivity, and union flexibility. Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S. The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries.

It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of \n\n needlessly.\" A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), \"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\" Wright notes the apparent discrepancy between Romans and Galatians, the former being much more positive about the continuing covenantal relationship between God and his ancient people than the latter. According to Wright, Paul distinguishes between works which are signs of ethnic identity, and those which are a sign of obedience to Christ. \"You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire.

Aeschylus' popularity is evident in the praise that the comic playwright Aristophanes gives him in The Frogs, produced some 50 years after Aeschylus' death. Aeschylus appears as a character in the play and claims, at line 1022, that his Seven against Thebes \"made everyone watching it to love being warlike\". Aeschylus goes on to say, at lines 1039ff., that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous. Examples include the final section (lines 908-1077) of Aeschylus' The Persians (472 BCE) in which Xerxes laments the defeat of his Persian army, the final appearance of Antigone in Sophocles' Antigone (c.442 BCE), the interaction between the chorus and Oedipus when he returns having blinded himself in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (c.429 BCE), and the exchange between Orestes, Electra and the chorus immediately after Clytemnestra's murder in Euripides' Electra (c.410 BCE). Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and \n\n Aeschylus (, ; Aiskhylos, ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, and is often described as the father of tragedy. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, Prometheus Bound, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion. Many authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred. A playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. In doing so, he essentially invented \"drama\": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex.\n\nQuestion: who wrote antigone and what are the dates of his birth and death\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work, Luke–Acts, by the same anonymous author. The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised messiah. Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with the ascension of Jesus to Heaven. The early chapters, set \n\n Jerusalem, describe the Day of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial. In the New Testament book of Acts of the Apostles, author St. Luke describes how a Jewish magician named Bar-Jesus (Elymas) was obstructing the Apostles in their preaching of the Gospel. While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Prior to the 1950s, Luke–Acts was seen as a historical work, written to defend Christianity before the Romans or Paul against his detractors; since then the tendency has been to see the work as primarily theological. His \"salvation history\" stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of \"the Law and the Prophets\" (Luke 16:16), the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5–3:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the Kingdom of God was preached (Luke\n\nQuestion: who is the book of acts written to\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama proposed making community college tuition free to many residents of the US. Despite its popularity, the plan did not materialize. In September 2015, the College Promise Campaign was started, which serves to educate and promote College Promise programs in the United States. By 2017, 16 states had at least one statewide College Promise program. A year later, the College Promise movement grew to over 300 programs in 24 states. were wary of the student testing designed to ensure higher educational standards, and favored higher levels of federal spending on educational programs for minorities and the economically disadvantaged. Bush believed that educational costs should primarily be borne by state and local governments, and he did not favor dramatically raising the overall level of federal funding for education. Because of the lack of support from both liberals and conservatives, Congress did not act on his education proposals. Bush later introduced the voluntary \"America 2000\" program, which sought to rally business leaders and local governments around education reform. Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act. According to Simons, he founded the program to address failures in the US education system to produce students highly qualified in STEM skills and knowledge, which reduces America's ability to compete in the global economy. He created the program to provide math and science teachers with higher salaries \n\nWASHINGTON – The federal government will give the healthcare workforce $130.8 million in grants, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Friday. The awards include $50.5 million for state-of-the-art training equipment and technology, such as e-learning tools, video, audio and interactive learning systems and simulators. The grants include $88.7 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \"Today's awards not only will provide more training opportunities for people interested in a health professions career, but also will support equipment purchases and faculty development to expand and enhance the quality of training.\" \"With an aging and increasingly diverse population, we need to prepare our health professionals to meet the challenges of providing healthcare in the 21st century,\" said Mary K. Wakefield, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which oversees the programs. \"This includes ensuring diversity in the workforce, and that well-trained professionals practice in areas of severe need.\" Funding will target workforce development programs for pre- and post-doctoral training for dental residents; dental faculty; loan repayment for faculty who teach primary care dentistry; and training for practicing dentists, or other approved dental trainees in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene programs. Grants are designed to strengthen the delivery of multidisciplinary comprehensive oral health care, integral to quality primary care. Funding from the Recovery Act will provide 208 awards to assist with purchasing equipment for training current and future health professionals across disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and post- graduate education levels. Twenty-nine grants will be made to states that provide matching funds to assist health professionals in repaying their educational loans. Funding will support 10 grants for patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention programs, typically supported by healthcare information technology, to develop and operate patient navigator services that improve healthcare outcomes for individuals with cancer or other chronic diseases, with specific emphasis on health disparity populations. 11-18.

The Vikings improved upon their 10–6 record and defended their NFC North title from 2008, their first successful defense of a divisional title since they won six NFC Central titles in a row between 1973 and 1978. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season. Three Vikings scored eight touchdowns: running back Latavius Murray, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and tight end Kyle Rudolph. The Viking's #2 seeding meant that U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season; all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium also hosted another postseason game that season were Wild Card Playoffs. They matched their 13–3 record and NFC Championship appearance from the last season, clinching home-field advantage in the NFC playoffs for the first time since 2011. With their victory over the Bears in Week 17, they earned home field advantage, a first round bye, and the No. On December 29, 2013, the Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome, a 14–13 victory over the Detroit Lions.

Epic launched the title through a paid early access then, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. Following on the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of Fortnite called Fortnite Battle Royale, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile platforms. Fortnite Battle Royale quickly gained an audience, amassing over 125 million players by May 2018 with estimates of having earned over US$1 billion by July 2018 through microtransactions, including its battle pass system. Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly grew popular, leading Epic to port the game to other systems, including onto mobile devices by mid-2018. Player count continued to expand when Epic broke new ground by convincing Sony to change its stance on cross-platform play allowing players on any device to compete with each other in Fortnite Battle Royale. Fortnites commercial success enabled Epic to make several changes to its other \n\n program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of Fortnite and released it as Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017. Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players.

Stamp history: no previous definitive set had included more than one prominent female (Martha Washington in the issues of 1902, 1922 and 1938; Susan B. Anthony in the Liberty series). This was also the first definitive issue to include a stamp devoted to an African-American, with Frederick Douglass portrayed on the 25¢ denomination.

Today, there is a plaque at the site as part of the \"Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail\" honoring the event.

In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. No special projection equipment was needed. In 1928, \n\n After experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with additive color systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, rather than in rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation developed a subtractive color print process. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. In 2002, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones became the first major feature-length film to be \n\n In 1927, Warner Bros. released the first feature-length film with sound, The Jazz Singer, whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called Vitaphone.

Dylan wrote all of the songs himself with the exception of \"Duquesne Whistle\", which he co-wrote with longtime Grateful Dead associate Robert Hunter. Tempest was Dylan's last album to feature original material until his 2020 album Rough and Rowdy Ways. Live at The Gaslight 1962 captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" (often referred to as \"Hard Rain\"), \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\", and \"John Brown\". \"Rocks and Gravel\", also credited as a Bob Dylan composition, is Dylan's own adaptation of Brownie McGhee's \"Solid Road\" and Leroy Carr's \"Alabama Woman\", an arrangement that \n\n in the Wind\" was different: for the first time, Dylan discovered the effectiveness of moving from the particular to the general. It remains the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude.\" This period encapsulates Dylan's rise to fame as a folk singer and songwriter where he became the center of a cultural and musical upheaval, and continues through the electric controversy surrounding his move to a rock style of music. The title of the film is taken from the lyrics of Dylan's 1965 single \"Like a Rolling Stone\". \"Blowin' in the Wind\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962. It has been described as a protest song and poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war, and freedom.\n\nQuestion: who wrote knock knock knocking on heavens door\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information. Dendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. They connect the axon of one neuron to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron, forming synapses. Neurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons. In summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. They transmit information through electrical signals along the axon, receive signals through dendrites, and communicate with other neurons through synapses. This intricate system facilitates the transmission of various types of information, including sensory input and motor output, ultimately allowing for the functioning of the nervous system. Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. There are several types of nerve cells, also known as neurons, in the human body, each with its specific functions. Some of the main types include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. They gather information from various sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, skin, and nose, and transmit it to the central nervous system for processing. Examples of sensory neurons include those involved in vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Motor Neurons: Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands, allowing for voluntary and involuntary movements and controlling bodily functions. Interneurons: Interneurons, also known as association neurons, form connections between sensory and motor neurons. These are just a few examples of nerve cell types and their general functions. However, it's important to note that the nervous system is incredibly complex, and there are many more specialized types of neurons with unique roles and functions in different areas of the body. Some of the functional properties of the brain include information processing, motor control, sensory perception, memory storage and retrieval, emotions, and cognitive functions. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. Neurons also form networks and systems within the brain. Overall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain. usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them).

The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better.

Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia. As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters. In many cities bus service enjoys a legal monopoly, however some city governments have legalized bus competition due to pressure from consumers who desire lower prices and entrepreneurs that would like to provide them. Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated. The USPS has a monopoly on \"letter\" delivery within the United States and operates under a universal service obligation (USO), both of which are defined across a broad set of legal mandates, which obligate it to provide uniform price and quality across the entirety of its service area. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.

Until 2017, \"I've Got Friends\" was Manchester Orchestra's only top-10 chart success and their highest-charting song; this feat was bested by \"The Gold\", which reached No. \"I've Got Friends\" was used in multiple video game soundtracks, such as MLB 11: The Show and Dirt 3, as well as in the television show The Vampire Diaries. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor. The song was Rogers' second number one country hit as a solo artist. \"Friends in Low Places\" first entered the Hot Country Songs on August 18, 1990. 1, where it remained there for four weeks until it was knocked off by \"You Lie\" performed by Reba McEntire. By then, the song was already causing a stir. Brooks told a reporter from USA Today in October 1990, when the song was still at its chart peak, that he had received letters from high school students saying that they wanted to use \"Friends in Low Places\" as their \"class song,\" only to have it opposed by their principals because the song is about \n\n as a solo during a breast-cancer care show. Her solo version was an acoustic ballad with several lyrics changed, such as \"you've gotta get with my friends\" being changed to \"you've gotta be my best friend\".

The roots anchor the plant in the soil, absorbing water and nutrients necessary for its growth and development. Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight. On the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition. The integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. In conclusion, the integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants allows for a coordinated functioning of different parts, promoting stability, adaptability, and reproductive success. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms. A metamer is one of several segments that share in the construction of a shoot, or into which a shoot may be conceptually (at least) resolved. Each one of these joints of stem, bearing its leaf at the apex, is a plant element; or as we term it a phyton,—a potential plant, having all the organs \n\n system in response to drought, without damaging the remaining part. The pattern of stem growth in Lepidodendrales can be reconstructed by analyzing their cortical growth patterns. When plants are immature, the cortex is extensive and the outer stem surface is covered with many rows of leaf bases. As the tree continues to grow, the secondary xylem and periderm originate from the vascular cambium and phellogen. This increase in stem tissue and stem diameter results in the sloughing off of outer tissues including leaf bases; hence, in older areas of the plant the outer surface of the trunk is protected by the periderm.\n\nQuestion: what are the main functions of the stem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In thick skin, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum is present between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. These processes form intercellular bridges with neighboring cells, contributing to the overall strength and integrity of the skin. On the surface of the skin is the stratum corneum, which is composed of fully keratinized cells. In thick skin, such as the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum can be observed between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. From the basal layer to the outermost layer, the epidermis consists of keratinocytes that produce keratin, form intercellular bridges, and provide a water barrier. The epidermis also contains other cell types like melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells, which contribute to the skin's color, immune response, and sensory perception. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells. Although the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose. The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis. It is composed of layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes surrounded by a lipid matrix, which together act as \n\nScattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker.It serves many important functions, including regulating body temperature, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and sensing painful and pleasant stimuli. Anything that interferes with skin function or causes changes in appearance can have important consequences for physical and mental health. Structure and Function\n\nThe skin has three layers—the epidermis, dermis, and fat layer (also called the subcutaneous layer). Epidermis: The epidermis is the relatively thin, tough, outer layer of the skin. Most of the cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. They originate from cells in the deepest layer of the epidermis called the basal layer. The outermost portion of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is relatively waterproof and, when undamaged, prevents most bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis (along with other layers of the skin) also protects the internal organs, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels against trauma. In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.Getting Under the Skin\n\nThe skin has three layers.Beneath the surface of the skin are nerves, nerve endings, glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels.The epidermis also contains Langerhans' cells, which are part of the skin's immune system.Although these cells help detect foreign substances and defend the body against infection, they also play a role in the development of skin allergies.\n\nQuestion: the outer layer of the skin that contains no blood or nerve supply is the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sevendust tried to pull \"Black\" off of the band's self-titled debut album before recording the song. Sevendust guitarist John Connolly said \"It was one of the first songs that we had done together as a band.

It was the last song we played for our label and the producers and they all just laughed and [said], \"You guys are funny, man. (laughs)\"\n\n \"Rehab\" is a song written and recorded by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, from her second and final studio album Back to Black (2006). Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. \"Rehab\" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. Near the end of 1995, Psychedelic Furs splinter group Love Spit Love was approached by the music supervisor of the movie The Craft, who inquired if the band might record a cover of the Smiths' \"How Soon Is Now?\". After initial reluctance, the band recorded the song, and it was released as a single from the movie's soundtrack in 1996. \"There's No Home for You Here\" is a song by American alternative rock band the White Stripes, featured on their 2003 fourth studio album Elephant. It was released as the fourth single from the album on March 15, 2004 in the United Kingdom. The B-side of the 7\" vinyl record is a medley of \"I Fought Piranhas\" and \"Let's Build a Home\" &ndash; from The White Stripes (1999) and De Stijl (2000), respectively &ndash; recorded at Electric Lady Studios on November 16, 2003.\n\nQuestion: what year did seven nation army come out\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A new national network for left-wing student organizing, also calling itself Students for a Democratic Society, was founded in 2006. On March 24, organized by professors against the war at the University of Michigan, a teach-in protest was attended by 2,500 participants. ; On April 17, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a civil rights activist group, led the first of several anti-war marches in Washington, D.C., with about 25,000 protesters. ; Draft-card burnings took place at University of California, \n\n In the fall of 1967, members of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (often referred to as \"MOBE\"), which was directed by David Dellinger, proposed a massive anti-war demonstration to coincide with the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

Ross became part of the early leadership of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). At an SDS meeting held at Ann Arbor in 1961, a National Executive Committee (NEC) was elected with Ross as vice president. As a delegate at the 1962 annual convention, and a member of the \"drafting committee\", Ross participated in writing the Port Huron Statement, which was adopted as the SDS political manifesto.\n\nQuestion: where did students for a democratic society start\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Early in 1483, the king and queen established a council, the Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición, to govern the inquisition and chose Torquemada to head it as inquisitor general. After the 1400s, few Spanish inquisitors were from the religious orders. Its first official Inquisitor was archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras, who established the \"Tribunal de la Fe\" (Tribunal of the Faith) in Mexico City. Through the Holy Office he transferred to Mexico the principles of the Inquisition set by Tomas Torquemada in Spain. Historian Luis González Obregón estimates that 51 death \n\n With the institution of the Roman Catholic Inquisition in Spain, and with the Dominican friar Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General, the Catholic Monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity. Though Isabella opposed taking harsh measures against Jews on economic grounds, Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand. In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-fé in which an effigy of him was burned. Reina wrote the first great book against the Inquisition: Sanctae Inquisitionis hispanicae artes aliquot detectae, ac palam traductae (\"Some arts of Holy Inquisition\"). Another prominent form of fanaticism according to some came a few centuries later with the Spanish Inquisition. Selengut said, \"The inquisitions were attempts at self-protection and targeted primarily \"internal enemies\" of the church\".

In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day. Some Native Americans in the United States have had difficulty with the use of alcohol. Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" In 1773 the missionary David Zeisberger was preaching in Shawnee communities in Ohio when he encountered Chief Gischenatsi, who told the missionary that the sale of alcohol was a deliberate attempt to undermine indigenous culture: \nAs the white people understand the weakness and incapacity of the Indians, they have a certain power over us, while pretending that, with all their deception, they mean well by the Indians. [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. By 1872 tribal population was down to 700, with no males over the age of fifty-five. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. Lewis St. John, writing about the tribes of Washington State, says: The year following the Heff decision saw an increase of the liquor traffic among the Indians of Puget Sound undreamed-of before. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. Within Lakota society there are few social controls on alcohol misuse, nor is there pressure to stay sober. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress. Studies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers.

Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance.

Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" In 1773 the missionary David Zeisberger was preaching in Shawnee communities in Ohio when he encountered Chief Gischenatsi, who told the missionary that the sale of alcohol was a deliberate attempt to undermine indigenous culture: \nAs the white people understand the weakness and incapacity of the Indians, they have a certain power over us, while pretending that, with all their deception, they mean well by the Indians. [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. By 1872 tribal population was down to 700, with no males over the age of fifty-five. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. Lewis St. John, writing about the tribes of Washington State, says: The year following the Heff decision saw an increase of the liquor traffic among the Indians of Puget Sound undreamed-of before. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. This contrasts sharply with the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which surveyed adolescents and adults receiving treatment and found that 9.7% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months (compared to 6.1% of whites). An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. Within Lakota society there are few social controls on alcohol misuse, nor is there pressure to stay sober. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress. Studies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach.

The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" In 1773 the missionary David Zeisberger was preaching in Shawnee communities in Ohio when he encountered Chief Gischenatsi, who told the missionary that the sale of alcohol was a deliberate attempt to undermine indigenous culture: \nAs the white people understand the weakness and incapacity of the Indians, they have a certain power over us, while pretending that, with all their deception, they mean well by the Indians. [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. By 1872 tribal population was down to 700, with no males over the age of fifty-five. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. Lewis St. John, writing about the tribes of Washington State, says: The year following the Heff decision saw an increase of the liquor traffic among the Indians of Puget Sound undreamed-of before. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. This contrasts sharply with the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which surveyed adolescents and adults receiving treatment and found that 9.7% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months (compared to 6.1% of whites). An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. Within Lakota society there are few social controls on alcohol misuse, nor is there pressure to stay sober. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress. Studies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach. Indian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA. Organizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services. Native American Connections: Behavioral Health Services\n White Bison Recovery Resources\n Native American Indian General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous\n American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, as of 2017, was over 4 decades old and was included in the 2-volume Encyclopedia of American Indian Issues Today, published 2013. SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide. Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area. Native American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities. First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness. Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Alcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. From January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.

Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" In 1773 the missionary David Zeisberger was preaching in Shawnee communities in Ohio when he encountered Chief Gischenatsi, who told the missionary that the sale of alcohol was a deliberate attempt to undermine indigenous culture: \nAs the white people understand the weakness and incapacity of the Indians, they have a certain power over us, while pretending that, with all their deception, they mean well by the Indians.

The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach. Indian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA. Organizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services. Native American Connections: Behavioral Health Services\n White Bison Recovery Resources\n Native American Indian General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous\n American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, as of 2017, was over 4 decades old and was included in the 2-volume Encyclopedia of American Indian Issues Today, published 2013. SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide. Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area. Native American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities. First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness. Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Alcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. From January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.

This was the first Olympics since the June 2018 signing of the Prespa agreement between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia over the \"Macedonia\" naming dispute, resulting in the latter officially being renamed North Macedonia. This is also the second consecutive Summer Olympics that selected independent Olympic participants compete under the Olympic Flag as part of the \"Refugee Olympic Team\". As a result of the 2020 ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on the Russian doping scandal, Russian athletes compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee, and under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. The team finished first in the overall medal rankings for the first time since 1984, and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics. Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid. It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 606-nanometer wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes. Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton. This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1 Å = 10−10 m. The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.\n\n extreme conditions, krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2 according to the following equation:  Krypton gas in a krypton fluoride laser absorbs energy from a source, causing the krypton to react with fluorine gas, producing the exciplex krypton fluoride, a temporary complex in an excited energy state:  The complex can undergo spontaneous or stimulated emission, reducing its energy state to a metastable, but highly repulsive ground state. The reaction of with  produces an unstable compound,, that contains a krypton-oxygen bond. Kr + F2 → KrF2 2 Kr + → 2 KrF 2 KrF → 2 Kr +  Like the other noble gases, krypton is chemically highly unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in the +2 oxidation state parallels that of the neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction it is difficult to oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states.\n\nQuestion: element named after fictional planet from which superman came\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. In the preliminary round and intermediate round, each group is played as a round-robin mini-tournament at one of the teams selected as hosts after the draw. The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia saw early elimination for Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia who all lost their first two group games. Nigeria also lost their first group game against Croatia 2–0, but the team got a win in their second game, over Iceland 2–0, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists Argentina.

In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. The circulatory system delivers oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to and from the heart through a series of blood vessels. The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. As the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. This exchange of gases and nutrients occurs due to the thin walls of the capillaries. Once the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins. the main function of the pulmonary system. The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen.

Initially, he was producing postcards under contract for W. J. Nigh & Sons Ltd, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. From 1937 (evidenced by a postmark on a colour tinted photo card of Shanklin Old Village) he was producing postcards on his own account. Cards with messages have been sporadically created and posted by individuals since the beginning of postal services. The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. Hook posted the card, which bears a penny black stamp, to himself in 1840 from Fulham (part of London). He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750. In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as \"Lipman's Postal Card\". These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability. On March 1, 1907, Federal legislation permitted senders, for the first time, to include a message on a portion of the back of a postcard. The origin of modern trading cards is associated with cigarette cards first issued by the US-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company in 1875. They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards.\n\nQuestion: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Each pound of bronze was coined into 48 pennies. Metallic zinc is the core of all United States currency coins, including copper-coated pennies. People who ingest a large number of coins will have elevated zinc levels, leading to zinc-toxicity-induced copper deficiency and the associated neurological symptoms. Once striking began, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint modified the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type \n\n one-third of all copper coinage had become worn or mutilated, often by advertisements.

All recognized denominations are entitled to direct government financial support, contributions made through the national tax system, or a mix of both. The state does not favor the Church of Sweden at the expense of other religious groups in any noticeable way. 18% of Swedish citizens responded that \"they believe there is a god\". Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping Æsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including Judaism and Roman Catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination.

It contains nutrients, oxygen, hormones, electrolytes, and waste products. These substances are exchanged between the blood and the cells through the capillary walls. The interstitial fluid compartment is approximately 12 liters in volume, while the total ECF compartment is around 14-15 liters. To summarize, the interstitial fluid compartment is an essential component of the extracellular fluid compartment. It contains nutrients, oxygen, and waste products that are exchanged between the blood and the cells. Understanding the composition and dynamics of the interstitial fluid is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and overall health. In lean healthy adult men, the total body water is about 60% (60–67%) of the total body weight; it is usually slightly lower in women (52-55%). The total body of water is divided into fluid compartments, between the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment (also called space, or volume) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (space, volume) in a two-to-one ratio: 28 (28–32) liters are inside cells and 14 (14–15) liters are outside cells. The fluids associated with the human body include air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, solvents, solutions, suspensions, serum, lymph, and blood. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. It differs from transcellular transport, where the substances travel through the cell passing through both the apical membrane and basolateral membrane ; 2. Renal physiology. In contrast, paracellular transport is the transfer of substances across an epithelium by passing through an intercellular space between the cells. **Solutes** are the particles dissolved or suspended in the water.The **solvent** is the water portion of fluids.This water (fluid) is divided into two main spaces or compartments—the fluid outside the cells, which is the **extracellular fluid (ECF)** ; and the fluid inside the cells, which is the **intracellular fluid (ICF). ** The ECF space contains about one third (about 15 L) of the total body water. **Transcellular fluids** are the fluids in special body spaces and include cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid. In the healthy adult, the volume of water in the fluid compartments remains within the normal range although the water moves constantly between compartments. _For proper function, the volume of all body fluids and the types and amount of dissolved substances must be carefully balanced._\n\n# Anatomy and Physiology Review\n\n## Physiologic Influences on Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n\nBody fluids are composed of water and particles dissolved or suspended in water. Solutes vary in type and amount from one fluid space to another.Body function depends on keeping the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes within each body fluid space.Three processes are important to control normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and they work together to maintain balance so the internal environment remains stable even when the external environment changes.These processes are filtration, diffusion, and osmosis.\n\nQuestion: what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. Napoleon's arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815.

Parton was honored in 2003 with a tribute album called Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton. The artists who recorded versions of Parton's songs included Melissa Etheridge (\"I Will Always Love You\"), Alison Krauss (\"9 to 5\"), Shania Twain (\"Coat of Many Colors\"), Meshell Ndegeocello (\"Two Doors Down\"), Norah Jones (\"The Grass is Blue\"), and Sinéad O'Connor (\"Dagger Through the Heart\"). Parton herself contributed a re-recording of the title song, originally the title song for her first RCA album in 1968. Parton was awarded the Living Legend \n\n In 1977, the song reached number 9 on the country music charts published by Billboard, and number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. An interesting side note is that while performing in Saskatoon in 1961, Cash selected a girl from the audience named Alexandra Wiwcharuk to sing the song to. The story goes that once Cash heard this news he never sang the song again.\" The album's title track, \"Coat of Many Colors\", tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes,\" rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags.\n\nQuestion: who sang the song a white sports coat and a pink carnation\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

The speaker is Whitney herself, who is, as the title of the poem indicates, writing to her unfaithful, or inconstant lover. Whitney begins by telling her lover that she has learned he is going to be married, despite his trying this a secret, which the first line explains: \"as close as you your wedding kept\". Whitney alternates between speaking as the jilted lover, reminding him what he is missing out on by abandoning her, or acting somewhat as a counsellor and \n\n an exchange of four letters between them written in an ornate Latin style. In Pope's poem, Eloisa confesses to the suppressed love that his letter has reawakened. She recalls their former life together and its violent aftermath, comparing the happy state of \"the blameless Vestal\" with her own reliving of past passion and sorrow. As Kłosowska describes, this sonnet participates in the tradition of courtly erotic joke making in which erotic meaning lies under the thin pretense of non-erotic solution; however, l'Aubespine's appropriation of the genre complicates the traditional gender standards of the time, because her sonnet is woman-centered and outlines mutual sexual gratification. She is portrayed as an unattainable woman who is too good for any of the men who are in love with her. The theme of \"the unattainable woman\" has been used thoroughly in medieval literature as well, although it differs from a dominatrix. Galatea keeps me on such a short leash”. In Robert Herrick's Hesperides, a book of poems published in 1648,. there were three revealing poems An Hymne to Love, The Dream, and To Love which showcase masculine longing for domination, restraint, discipline.

New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle. The crystallized magma forms a new crust of basalt known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt, and gabbro below it in the lower oceanic crust. Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic \n\n Oceanic detachment faults occur at spreading ridges where magmatic activity is not enough to account for the entire plate spreading rate. They are characterized by long domes parallel to the spreading direction (oceanic core complexes of the footwall). They cannot be structurally restored, as slip on the fault exceeds the thickness of oceanic crust (~30 km compared to ~6 km, for example). The footwall is also much more extensively hydrothermally altered than in continental settings. The subducting plate releases volatiles and solutes to these volcanoes, resulting in acidic fluids with higher concentrations of gases and metals than in the mid-ocean ridge. When hotspot volcanoes occur in the middle of oceanic plates, they create permeable and porous basalts with higher concentrations of gas than at mid-ocean ridges. Ocean crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is removed by subduction. Mid-ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. Along with degassing from magma, water interactions also produce a \n\n Geologic tension is also found in the tectonic regions of divergent boundaries. Here, a magma chamber forms underneath oceanic crust and causes sea-floor spreading in the creation of new oceanic crust. Some of the force that pushes the two plates apart is due to ridge push force of the magma chamber. The cooling and sinking ocean crust causes a tensile stress that also helps drive the pulling apart of the plates at the ridge axis.\n\nQuestion: where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cashiers have lost their jobs to cash overages/shortages, either for repeated violations or for large overages or shortages. All ATMs, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts. Some ATM cards can also be used at a branch, as identification for in-person transactions. The use of the ATM card for in store purchases or refunds is allowed only with pre-approved retailers, but not for on-line transactions. This includes account balance inquiries, electronic bill payments, or in some limited cases, online purchases (see Interac Online). Cashier balancing is a process usually conducted in businesses such as grocery stores, restaurants and banks that takes place at the closing of the business day or at the end of a cashier's shift. Counting the money is usually done in the back office: the drawer is removed from the register and taken into the office. Once the drawer is reset back to its starting amount for the next cashier's shift, it is either placed in the safe or given to another cashier that is starting their shift.\n\nQuestion: where do you get a cashiers check from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1966, Delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor. The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the Andaman district (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new Nicobar district in 1974). New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the government of India, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, and the Supreme Court of India. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931, by Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin. In the Union territories of India, which are ruled directly by the Union government, the President of India appoints an administrator.

He then returned to the young boy, telling him that a serious accident had occurred, only for the young Jesse to tell him that he knew this was coming and prayed that \n\nIn the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service. From a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job. The vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable. The traffic accident was our first call. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing. Sarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. After she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. We took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department. From delivering babies to attending scenes where someone has died, she responds to a wide range of incidents, some of which require a great deal of emotional resilience. Talking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope. But she said incidents can affect people in different ways, and it is important to have your own coping mechanisms. Our next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. The man, who was alcohol-dependent and had cirrhosis of the liver, was known to the service. Sarah then explained how paramedics make a diagnosis of death. After completing the diagnosis of death form she contacted emergency services control to check when the police would arrive. All this happened before lunchtime, showing just how intense and varied the life of a paramedic can be. In the afternoon we were called to a GP surgery to take a patient with suspected atrial fibrillation to hospital, attended a minor kitchen fire in a block of flats and saw a patient with multiple sclerosis who said she was in pain. Sarah thought the patient’s presentation and body language did not indicate she was in great pain, so she suggested the patient talk to the mental health liaison team in the emergency department, and she agreed to come with us to the hospital. Paramedics are on the front line of emergency care. Magbie was paralyzed from the neck down after being struck by a drunk driver at the age of four.

Dental fluorosis occurs when high levels of fluoride are ingested during the tooth mineralization process, which usually occurs in childhood. While fluoride is beneficial for dental health in appropriate amounts, excessive intake can lead to the appearance of white or brown spots on the teeth. When children are exposed to excessive fluoride, it can result in the disruption of enamel formation, leading to the appearance of mottled enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary depending on the level of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that dental fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic condition and does not usually cause any functional problems or pain. However, in severe cases, the enamel may become pitted or rough, and teeth may be more prone to staining and decay. Prevention of dental fluorosis involves several measures, such as using fluoride-containing products in appropriate amounts, teaching children to practice proper oral hygiene, and monitoring their fluoride intake from multiple sources. Dentists can also provide guidance on fluoride supplementation or the use of alternative sources of drinking water if necessary. In summary, the cause of mottled enamel, or dental fluorosis, is excessive exposure to fluoride during tooth development. Implementing preventive measures and maintaining proper oral hygiene can help minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. Dental fluorosis is a common disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. People with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage. Due to diffusion of exogenous ions (e.g., iron and copper), stains develop into the increasingly and abnormally porous enamel. An individual's fluorosis score is based on the most severe form of fluorosis found on two or more teeth. It scores the spectrum of fluorotic changes in enamel from 0 to 9, allowing more precise definition of mild and severe cases. Causes\nDental fluorosis is caused by a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion whilst teeth are forming. The most superficial concern in dental fluorosis is aesthetic changes in the permanent dentition (the adult teeth). The period when these teeth are at highest risk of developing fluorosis is between when the child is born up to 6 years old, though there has been some research which proposes that the most crucial course is during the first 2 years of the child's life. From roughly 7 years old thereafter, most children's permanent teeth would have undergone complete development (except their wisdom teeth), and therefore their susceptibility to fluorosis is greatly reduced, or even insignificant, despite the amount of intake of fluoride. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the amount of fluoride exposure, the age of the child, individual response, weight, degree of physical activity, nutrition, and bone growth. Individual susceptibility to fluorosis is also influenced by genetic factors. Many well-known sources of fluoride may contribute to overexposure including dentifrice/fluoridated mouthrinse (which young children may swallow), excessive ingestion of fluoride toothpaste, bottled waters which are not tested for their fluoride content, inappropriate use of fluoride supplements, ingestion of foods especially imported from other countries, and public water fluoridation. The last of these sources is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of all fluorosis, but the resulting effect due to water fluoridation is largely and typically aesthetic. Dental fluorosis has been growing in the United States concurrent with fluoridation of municipal water supplies, although disproportionately by race. A 2010 CDC report acknowledges an overall incidence of dental fluorosis of 22% from 1986-87 increased to 41% in the early 21st century, with an increase in moderate to severe dental fluorosis from 1% to 4%. More than one in five American teens (23%) have moderate to severe dental fluorosis on at least two teeth.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control found a 9 percentage point increase in the prevalence of confirmed dental fluorosis in a 1999-2002 study of American children and adolescents than was found in a similar survey from 1986-1987 (from 22.8% in 1986-1987 to 32% in 1999-2002). The use of fluoride supplements as a prevention for tooth decay is rare in areas with water fluoridation, but was recommended by many dentists in the UK until the early 1990s. In November 2006 the American Dental Association published information stating that water fluoridation is safe, effective and healthy; that enamel fluorosis, usually mild and difficult for anyone except a dental health care professional to see, can result from ingesting more than optimal amounts of fluoride in early childhood;  that it is safe to use fluoridated water to mix infant formula; and that the probability of babies developing fluorosis can be reduced by using ready-to-feed infant formula or using water that is either free of fluoride or low in fluoride to prepare  powdered or liquid concentrate formula. They go on to say that the way to get the benefits of fluoride but minimize the risk of fluorosis for a child is to get the right amount of fluoride, not too much and not too little. \"Your dentist, pediatrician or family physician can help you determine how to optimize your child’s fluoride intake.\" Prevention\nDental fluorosis can be prevented by lowering the amount of fluoride intake to below the tolerable upper limit.

As research continued, the protective effect of fluoride against dental decay was demonstrated. References\n\nExternal links \n\nDevelopmental tooth disorders\nToxic effects of dietary elements\n\nThe prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily attributed to the intake of excessive amounts of fluoride during the tooth development period, typically from birth to around 6-8 years of age. This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary from very mild, characterized by small white areas in the enamel, to severe cases where teeth appear stained and pitted. While drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These additional sources include toothpastes, mouth rinses, fluoride supplements, fluoridated salt or milk, as well as locally applied dental gels, solutions, and varnishes. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis. It is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. Apart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure. In summary, while drinking water can contribute to fluoride exposure, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily due to excessive fluoride intake during tooth development from various sources. Monitoring fluoride intake during this period is crucial to prevent dental fluorosis.\n\nQuestion: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain. Overall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation. - These axons form the optic nerve and connect mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the brain.

Most axons branch, \n\nThe optic nerve plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. These impulses are then transmitted through the fibers of the optic nerve to various visual centers in the brain. It consists of several layers of interconnected neurons and is supported by pigmented epithelial cells. The neural signals generated by the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. The output of these neurons takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These ganglion cells have axons that bundle together to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the electrical impulses generated by the retinal ganglion cells and transmits them to the brain. It is worth mentioning that the retina, including the optic nerve, is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. During vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon. Therefore, the optic nerve serves as a vital pathway through which visual information is transmitted from the retina to the brain, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the visual world. The cells are somewhat flask-shaped; the rounded internal surface of each resting on the stratum opticum, and sending off an axon which is prolonged into it. The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer.\n\nQuestion: ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The U.S. state of Georgia is known as the \"Peach State\" due to its significant production of peaches as early as 1571, with exports to other states occurring around 1858. In 2014, Georgia was third in US peach production behind California and South Carolina. Garden Peach tomatoes are a cultivar of tomato, native South American fruit mainly from Peru. With its yellow coloring, blushing vaguely pink mottling when very ripe, and fuzzy skin, it resembles a peach. This heirloom is colored exactly like a peach and has a sweet mild flavor. Fruits are 2-4 oz. Garden Peaches have soft fuzzy skins and mature in 65 days on average. unsuitable for peach cultivation, as the rain promotes peach leaf curl, which is the most serious fungal disease for peaches. In practice, fungicides are extensively used for peach cultivation in such climates, with more than 1% of European peaches exceeding legal pesticide limits in 2013. Finally, summer heat is required to mature the crop, with mean temperatures of the hottest month between 20 and 30 C. Typical peach cultivars begin bearing fruit in their third year. Peach tea is an herbal decoction brewed from the fresh or dried leaves as well as the bark of the peach plant found in the Northwest China, having several therapeutic properties owing to the presence of essential nutrients. Alternately, the edible, fuzzy peach fruits are also used along with regular tea to prepare healthy drinks. You may also add some peach syrup to the drink for enhancing the flavor. Bottled or canned peach ice tea can also be availed from any online herbal tea store. are typically thinned out because if the full number of peaches mature on a branch, they are undersized and lack flavor. Fruits are thinned midway in the season by commercial growers. Fresh peaches are easily bruised, so do not store well. They are most flavorful when they ripen on the tree and are eaten the day of harvest. The peach tree can be grown in an espalier shape. The Baldassari palmette is a design created around 1950 used primarily for training peaches. In walled gardens constructed from stone or brick, which absorb and retain solar heat and then slowly release it, raising the temperature against the wall, peaches can be grown as espaliers against south-facing walls as far north as southeast Great Britain and southern Ireland.\n\nQuestion: where do peaches come from in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act\n\n Lead, which was used in gasoline until 1995 and paint until 1978, is known to damage the nervous system in various ways. ; If there is lead paint in the house, or if there is an apparent danger of lead poisoning from lead paint in the house, then that information must be disclosed to the buyer. ; The buyer must be allowed ten days to request an evaluation of any lead paint in the house. In the past, lead was added to household paint to increase its drying speed and improve the durability and life of the finish. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm).

Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues if obtained from a reputable breeder. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong \"prey drive\" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them. Puppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur.

Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. The combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. Shooting erupted at Lexington.

Epidemics swept through California Indian Country, such as the 1833 malaria epidemic. Early to mid 19th Century, coastal tribes of northwest California had multiple contacts with Russian explorers due to Russian colonization of the Americas. Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners had been common during the time of Mexican rule and these increased after the 1848 American annexation and Gold Rush in California. Such marriages combined the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. As Americans increased in number, however, they pushed out Californios from power in California. Many married Californio women and became Mexican citizens, learning Spanish and often converting to Catholicism, the state religion. They are often also considered Californios, for their adherence to Californio language and culture. In California, the federal government established such forms of education as the reservation day schools and American Indian boarding schools. Some public schools would allow Indians to attend as well.

The National Industry Recovery Act set up the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The PWA used government money to build infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, for the state. The National Recovery Act also improved working conditions and outlawed child labor.

From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. Systemic circulation begins when oxygenated blood enters the left atrium from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. As the oxygen is used up and waste products are produced, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process of circulation begins again. the main function of the pulmonary system. The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. It begins when deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, specifically the right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery. In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. One key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. The systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively de-oxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins.The left side of the heart pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation.The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries.It is surrounded by a tough fibrous sac, the pericardium, which also contains the beginnings and ends of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood through pulmonary circulation. The left side of the heart pumps blood through systemic circulation.

At the end of the transition period, there is no longer the possibility of retirement for contribution time. The minimum retirement age will be 62 for women and 65 for men for both private and servants. Contrary to the claim, raising the minimum retirement age for women is disregarding the double - even triple - journey they face. As a general rule, the minimum age for women would increase from 60 to 62 years. For rural workers, the minimum age would change from 55 to 60 years. Most Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. However, in 1986 the Japanese Diet passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly \n\nBut no single one of these measures can bear the full load of adaptation to population aging, since the changes would have to be so severe and disruptive as to be politically impossible.Pressures to increase retirement ages in industrialized countries and to reduce benefits are increasing.In other words, while in crude terms there are today 4 workers supporting the pensions and other costs of each older person, by 2050 there will only be 2. There are only so many ways to meet the challenge of an extended period of dependency, including increasing the productivity of those in the labor force, saving more, reducing consumption, increasing the number of years worked by increasing the age of retirement, increasing the voluntary nonmonetary productive contributions of the retired, and immigration of very large numbers of young workers into the “old” countries. For those who are against Social Security reform, the government's proposal to establish the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement disregards the different life expectations within Brazil. In this sense, the minimum age of 62 for women and 65 for men proposed by the current government is very high and close to the average life expectancy of some states. In addition, increasing the minimum contribution time to 20 years for men is disregarding the Brazilian reality - marked by informal work especially for people with lower education and income - and hindering access to retirement.\n\nQuestion: when did the government change the retirement age\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dr. Vogiatzi ordered several tests, including an MRI of Jill’s brain to check if her pituitary or hypothalamus looked abnormal, but unfortunately nothing was conclusive. When it hadn’t, Dr. Vogiatzi referred Jill to Louisa Pyle, MD, PhD, and Emma Bedoukian, MS, of the Differences of Sexual Development and Endogenetics Clinic, within the Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center (RIMGC). The genetic testing results confirmed their and Dr. Vogiatzi’s suspicions, based on Jill’s missing sense of smell; she had Kallmann syndrome. Jill didn’t have those symptoms. People with FGFR1 mutations may have any range of puberty from normal to start-and-stall puberty (as was the case with Jill) to no hint of sexual development, which is called complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency.

The character moved to Med after being introduced in the show's backdoor pilot on Chicago Fire and Gehlfuss was made a regular cast member when the characters at Chicago Medical Center who appeared in both Fire and P.D. When Med first premiered, he was Chief Resident. Charge Nurse Maggie Lockwood, who sometimes uses the nickname \"Big Red\" when referring to Dr. Halstead, once described him as \"a slightly anal, overly stubborn, rule breaking, control freak\". Dr. Halstead's relationship with hospital administrator Sharon Goodwin has been historically fraught, and Halstead's job has been jeopardized on multiple occasions. In season 1 Dr. Halstead clashes a number of times with Dr. Connor Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and Sharon Goodwin, the chief administrator, over hospital practices and policies. He particularly disliked Dr. Rhodes as he felt the latter was an entitled \"rich kid\" from the more affluent northern suburbs. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another. He also earns the ire of attending Dr. Kendra Perrington in the episode \"Inheritance\" for overriding her at the request of the patient's brother, who was his former schoolmate, only to find out that she was on the hiring committee. During the first season, Dr. Halstead had feelings for the pediatric emergency medicine fellow, Dr. Natalie Manning, who was then pregnant with her late husband's baby. It caused some awkwardness as her mother-in-law (portrayed by actress Annie Potts) was extremely protective and initially viewed him with suspicion. He eventually decided to move on and starts dating pathologist Nina Shore (portrayed by Patti Murin, the real-life wife of Gehlfuss' co-star Colin Donnell). They move in together in the season 2 episode \"Free Will\". In the first episode of season 3 “Nothing To Fear”, she returns from a three-month sabbatical and tells him she also has feelings for him too and they became a couple. In season 4 they prepare for their wedding but Dr. Halstead finds himself in a difficult position when a neighborhood friend he made a house call to turns out to be federally listed criminal wanted by both the CPD and FBI. Dr. Natalie Manning\n\nPortrayed by Torrey DeVitto\n\nDr. Natalie Manning (née Conte) is a pediatrician originally from Seattle who is an attending in emergency medicine specializing in pediatrics. Natalie was widowed when her husband, Jeff, a soldier, was killed in Afghanistan and gave birth to their son, Owen. She is revealed to be a skilled  violinist, as seen in season 1 episode \"Fallback\" and season 2 episode \"Brother's Keeper\". In season 1, Natalie is portrayed as a caring doctor who sometimes becomes overly emotionally connected to her young patients. In Season 1, Episode 10, \"Clarity\", Dr Will Halstead kisses her, showing her that he has feelings for her. However, as she is grieving her late husband, she gently tells Dr Halstead that she does have feelings for him, it just \"isn't the right time yet\".

Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west. The Paraguay River, which runs from north to south, divides Paraguay into two distinct geographic regions—the Región Oriental (Eastern Region) and the Región Occidental (Western Region), also called the Chaco Boreal. Triángulo Dionisio Foianini (Dionisio Foianini Triangle) is the name given to Bolivia's border with Brazil and Paraguay. Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá. The Mamore is interrupted by rapids a few miles above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 300 km long has been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles). It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers. From there, it ranges along the Andean foothills to northwestern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and finally the Rio de la Plata.\n\nQuestion: where does the paraguay river start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Ohio River drains portions of eight states, including, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. At its widest point, it is one mile wide at Smithland dam. From the confluence of the Ohio River and Upper Mississippi River at Cairo, the Lower flows just under 1000 miles (1600 km) to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most heavily travelled component of the Mississippi River System. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River. The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the \"Point\" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio \n\n The Mississippi River System, also referred to as the Western Rivers, is a mostly riverine network of the United States which includes the Mississippi River and connecting waterways. The Mississippi River is the largest drainage basin in the United States. In the United States, the Mississippi drains about fifty-nine percent of the country's rivers. From the perspective of natural geography and hydrology, the system consists of the Mississippi River itself and its numerous natural tributaries and distributaries. The major tributaries are the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Red rivers. Given their flow volumes, major Ohio River tributaries like the Allegheny, Tennessee, and Wabash rivers are considered important tributaries to the Mississippi\n\nQuestion: where does the ohio river and the mississippi river meet\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During Odysseus' time there, the Phaeacians stage a series of athletic contests for Odysseus so that he could spread stories about the Phaeacians' athletic prowess. After declining the offer, one Phaeacian, Euryalos, joked that Odysseus did not have the skills to compete in an athletic competition. The geography of the Apologoi (the tale that Odysseus told to the Phaeacians, forming books 9-12 of the Odyssey), and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of Scheria, pose quite different problems from those encountered in identifying Troy, Mycenae, Pylos and Ithaca. For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. Events in the main sequence of the Odyssey (excluding the narrative of Odysseus's adventures) take place in the Peloponnese and in what are now called the Ionian Islands (Ithaca and its neighbours). However, scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after Ismaros and before his return to Ithaca) were real. The geographer Strabo and many others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer Eratosthenes had said in the late 3rd century BC: \"You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds.\" In the Odyssey, Homer gives him the epithet \"the peer of murderous Ares\". In Book 9 of the Odyssey, Odysseus describes to his hosts the Phaeacians his encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus. Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says \"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes\". In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as: \"an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich\n\nQuestion: where do the phaeacians live in the odyssey\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of pinhole, concave lenses, and magnifying glasses in his 1021 AD Book of Optics. The English friar Roger Bacon's 1260s or 1270s written works on optics, partly based on the works of Arab writers, described the function of corrective lenses for vision and burning glasses. The name \"microscope\" was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625. Galileo greatly improved upon these designs the following year. The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 \n\n There is disputed archeological evidence of use of lenses in antiquity, spanning several millennia.

There are three distinct ways that precipitation can occur. Precipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing level. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Their respective intensities are classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction. Even though precipitation can fall in many forms and in many locations, most precipitations either ends up back into a body of water or on land as surface runoff. The other portion of runoff soaks into the ground as infiltration, some of this water will infiltrate deep into the ground and replenish aquifers. The mixture of rain and snow is called sleet. It is  normally accompanied by heavy precipitation. Convective precipitation (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \"roll clouds\" and tornadoes may occur. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.\n\nQuestion: what are the four main types of precipitation\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. In terms of epidemiology, achondroplasia is similar to many other congenital conditions such as achondrogenesis, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda and osteogenesis imperfecta.

Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Two other diseases have similar genetic basis, namely thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds. The other visible signs and symptoms of this disease are hypotonia or low muscle tone and slow motor movement. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature. All people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood. in Mainland China, the ratio of men to women is 1.06, far higher than most countries. Using actual numbers, this means that in Mainland China alone, there are 50 million women \"missing\" – that should be there but are not. Adding up similar numbers from South and West Asia results in a number of \"missing\" women higher than 100 million. The average head-and-body length of the male is 55 cm, with a range of 46 to 68 cm, while the female averages 52 cm with a range of 41 to 55 cm. In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females. The tail is about 30 cm long in both sexes. The height at the shoulder is 25 to 30 cm. On average males weigh 3.5 kg, with a range of 3.2 to 9.4 kg, while females average 2.9 kg, with a range of 1.4 to 3.2 kg.\n\nQuestion: what is the average height of a chinese man\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative. Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as\n\n A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water. For optical instruments with an eyepiece, the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece (virtual image in infinite distance) cannot be given, thus size means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point (angular size). By convention, for magnifying glasses and optical microscopes, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: 25 cm from the eye. length f at the distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor at 2f beyond that lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second image with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula showing that with object distance ). In modern optical telescopes and telescopic sights with a dual-focal plane design, the objective image is typically already inverted upon reaching the relay lenses, and thus needed to be inverted again back\n\nQuestion: a concave mirror can form a real image which is a copy of an object that forms\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1953, they proposed a model in which DNA forms a double helix, consisting of two strands that are twisted around each other. By unraveling the structural foundation of DNA, Watson and Crick laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology. Overall, the collaboration between Watson and Crick, coupled with insights from other scientists, led to the unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and paving the way for numerous scientific advancements. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was \n\n helical structure for DNA. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns of A-DNA were reported by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953. Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA.

In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness. Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on translational research. The NCI Formulary is a public-private partnership between NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is also one of NCI’s efforts in support of the Cancer Moonshot, answering Vice President Biden’s call for greater collaboration and faster development of new therapies for patients. “The NCI Formulary will help researchers begin testing promising drug combinations more quickly, potentially helping patients much sooner,” said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. “Rather than spending time negotiating agreements, investigators will be able to focus on the important research that can ultimately lead to improved cancer care.” The NCI Formulary launched today with fifteen targeted agents from six pharmaceutical companies: Bristol-Myers Squibb Eli Lilly and Company Genentech Kyowa Hakko Kirin Loxo Oncology Xcovery Holding Company LLC “The agreements with these companies demonstrate our shared commitment to expedite cancer clinical trials and improve outcomes for patients,” said James Doroshow, M.D., NCI Deputy Director for Clinical and Translational Research. The NCI Formulary leverages lessons learned through NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the NCI-MATCH trial, a study in which targeted agents from different companies are being tested alone or in combination in patients with genetic mutations that are targeted by these drugs. “We are very pleased that several additional pharmaceutical companies have already pledged a willingness to participate and are in various stages of negotiation with NCI,” said Dr. Doroshow, who is also director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. “By the end of 2017, we expect to have doubled the number of partnerships and drugs available in the NCI Formulary.” CTEP staff continue to discuss the NCI Formulary with pharmaceutical companies to make additional proprietary agents available for studies initiated by investigators at NCI-designated Cancer Centers. About the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH’s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers. For more information about cancer, please visit the NCI website at cancer.gov or call NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases. For more information about NIH and its programs, visit nih.gov. SEER began collecting data on cancer cases on January 1, 1973, in the states of Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, and the metropolitan areas of Detroit and San Francisco-Oakland. By 2001 the program included information on major population centers in Georgia, Washington, Louisiana, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Alaska, California, Kentucky. The association is headquartered in the Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center (BMC),. The primary responsibility of the NCI is to coordinate the National Cancer Program. These programs focus on conducting cutting-edge research in various areas related to cancer biology, treatment modalities, prevention strategies, and supportive care. Additionally, the NCI provides funding to support cancer researchers throughout the United States.\n\nQuestion: when did congress passes legislation to fund the national cancer institute\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. About 1.8 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers. In addition, the bill would increase the federal minimum cash wage for workers who receive tips by gradually raising that wage until it equals 70 percent of the federal minimum wage for other workers. The fight to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 promises stiff resistance from business interests. Advocates of raising the minimum wage assert this would provide households with more money to spend, while opponents recognize the impact this has on businesses', especially small businesses', ability to pay additional workers.

As he suffered in pain, Lettie suffered, watching her husband slowly fade away. During this time, her best-selling devotional book, Streams in the Desert, was conceived. Lettie wrote a daily devotional based on her hardships and her experiences of fellowship with God. Cowman was not seeking success during the time she wrote it. Yet, many readers found they could connect with Streams because it \"spoke to those who had difficulty relating their own sufferings to the noble and eternal purposes of a loving and all-wise God.\" Cowman often stated, \"I did not write Streams. Carol Frost (born 1948) is an American poet. Frost has published several collections of poetry, and has held several teaching residencies. Frost's poetry has been praised for its \"protean layers of observation\" and her “encyclopedic approach to subject matter.” Frost writes in intensive bursts of at least three weeks after spending not writing for several weeks or months.

Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype. What are the symptoms in humans? Humans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze and then touching their mouth or nose before washing their hands.) Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Although the current swine flu does not have a high mortality rate, it is known to be highly contagious. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. The concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze) and then touching their mouths or nose before washing their hands.

Americium is used in the most common type of household smoke detector, which uses 241Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms. In an ionisation type smoke detector, ambient air is allowed to freely enter the ionization chamber. If smoke enters the detector, it disrupts this current because ions strike smoke particles and are neutralized. This drop in current triggers the alarm. ; Initiating devices: These components act as inputs to the fire alarm control unit and are either manually or automatically activated. Examples would be devices such as pull stations, heat detectors, duct detectors, and smoke detectors. Heat and smoke detectors have different categories of both kinds. ; Fire alarm notification appliance: This component uses energy supplied from the fire alarm system \n\n Americium-241, an alpha emitter, is used in smoke detectors. Smoke particles from the fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm.\n\nQuestion: which type of fire detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature. Romanticism has been seen as \"the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages\", reaching beyond rational and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. The name \"Romanticism\" itself was derived from the medieval genre chivalric romance. This movement contributed to the strong influence of such romances, disproportionate to their actual \n\n In Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel. In Germany, the Sturm und Drang period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the century. In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the Belle Époque, with its Fin de siècle retrospectively appeared as a \"golden age\" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\n the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. Romantic medicine is part of the broader movement known as Romanticism, most predominant in the period 1800–1840, and involved both the cultural (humanities) and natural sciences, not to mention efforts to better understand man within a spiritual context ('spiritual science').\n\nQuestion: when did the romanticism period start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Apollinaire tried to implicate his friend Pablo Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning, but both were later exonerated. The real thief was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia an Italian wishing to return it to Italy. ; The returned Mona Lisa only received 60 visits at the Louvre in Paris. The painting had been missing for about two-and-half years before Vincenzo Peruggia, a Louvre employee who had stolen the painting, attempted to sell it to museum officials in Florence. Seeing the coverage of the supposed theft of the painting on television, Sarah Jane arrives at the gallery, encounters the Mona Lisa and insists she release those transferred into paintings. Both the Dark Rider and the Mona Lisa revert to being just works of art; and Sarah Jane, Miss Trupp and the others trapped in paintings are released. The story ends with the Mona Lisa restored to her frame and Luke promising to tidy his room. The theft of the statues had been committed in 1907 by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, who had recently returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the Paris-Journal. Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who had bought Iberian statues from Pieret, and who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but he was also exonerated. The theft of the Mona Lisa was perpetrated by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence.\n\nQuestion: who stole the mona lisa from the louvre in 1911\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The crash was the fastest fall in global stock markets in financial history and the most devastating crash since the Wall Street Crash of 1929. By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7 points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history. The 2015 Chinese stock market crash was also a bear market. In early 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple stock market crashes have led to bear markets across the world, many of which are still ongoing. A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles. There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\nQuestion: when was the last time stock market crashed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven. It also serves as a toast to celebrate a wedding agreement between Tevye and Lazar. See and Heard wrote \"In the inn scene Tevye leads a toast ‘To Life’ featuring an extravagant display of Jewish and Cossack folk dancing\". In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical shtetl in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to \"scratch out a pleasant, simple tune\" without breaking their necks.

Shortly after a Bill of Rights was ratified as the first ten amendments, guaranteeing fundamental rights used as justification for the revolution. The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation.

The role was kept under such heavy secrecy that Downes did not know who he was playing until the second trailer was released. On his role, Downes stated that he was proud to be part of the film and expressed his admiration in helping bring Doomsday to life in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. In some cases, the labial frenum extends down and between the two front teeth, creating a gap. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth. Traditional Orthodontics: Traditional orthodontics is highly effective at closing gaps between teeth. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy. A diastema (plural diastemata, from greek διάστημα, space) is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth. Any abnormality in teeth directly hampers the first look and diastema is one of the most common abnormalities seen in teeth. Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth. Anterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment. Diastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth). Diastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. The gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics. It is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws. Periodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation. The frenum is an extension of our gum in between specific teeth like central incisors, anteriorly and the molars, posteriorly. Gum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema. Periodontitis, on the other hand, affects structures surrounding the teeth, majorly underlying bone structure. Because of compromised bone structure and periodontal ligaments, mobility appears in teeth, hence the drifting and diastema. In cases of high frenal attachments, frenectomy can be done. This is a simple procedure that relieves the pressure on the teeth and drifting stops. In all of the cases mentioned above, after treating the underlying causes, fixed orthodontic therapy should be done followed by retention appliances. So, if you have a void in your dental arch, then visit your dentist as soon as possible. If you want to maintain a good esthetics, then the gap between teeth shouldn’t be ignored as our jaws expand over time. Over the period, the size of the diastema might enlarge and cause functional problems. One common cause is size mismatch, where the size of the teeth is smaller compared to the size of the jaw bone. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century.

Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member. The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus followed by confirmation of the full House through the passage of a House Resolution. If no candidate wins a majority of the \"votes cast for a person by name,\" then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times since 1789; and not since 1923 (68th Congress), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect Frederick H. Gillett speaker.

Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point. Upon opening, Tokyo DisneySea became the ninth park of the twelve worldwide Disney theme parks to \n\n as streaming media. While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. This original version would be located where the Matterhorn sits today. Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning 56.656 ha—the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. The Western River Expedition was to have been Walt Disney World's answer to this ride. When plans were being made for the Magic Kingdom, Imagineers had no plans to replicate Pirates of the Caribbean for the Magic Kingdom.

She has researched how seasonal migration of these butterflies affects parasite transmission, and also developed collaborative databases of mammalian infectious diseases, on host behavior, ecology, and life history interact with global-scale patterns of parasitism. She also focused her research on songbird-pathogen dynamics, including studies of house finch conjunctivitis, West Nile virus, and salmonellosis. Altizer has published several publications and she recently co-edited a book that would be published in 2015, titled Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Insect. She also and participated in high-level task forces dedicated to monarch butterfly conservation. A citizen science project called Monarch Health is run by her students at University of Georgia, which is now the eighth year. There are hundreds of volunteers across North America in sampling wild monarchs for a debilitating disease. Steven M. Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology. Biography\n\nEarly life\nSteven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth—an insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis. Education and career\nReppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals. To determine the function of mPER1–3, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them. This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock. In 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2. Monarch butterfly migration\n\nSince 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration. Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000 km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico. Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants. Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism. 24 hours later, CRY2 returns to the nucleus and inhibits CLK:CYC transcription. Meanwhile, PER is progressively phosphorylated, which may aid CRY2 translocation into the nucleus. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle: without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient to the south. The discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants underscores how vulnerable the migration may be to climate change. The goal of the project was to make genomic and proteomic information about monarch butterflies accessible to biological and lepidopteran communities. Targeted mutagenesis of Cry2 indeed resulted in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. In 2016, Reppert collaborated with Marcus Kronforst at the University of Chicago and others to use population genetic studies to define the evolutionary history of the monarch migration.

Honey and Agnes could not be any more different, and the older they get the more they are growing apart. Honey was abandoned by her mother as a newborn, but she lived in the nursery with Agnes until she turned 7 years old; Honey lives with Winky and Agnes lives with her parents and her brother, Benny. Ever since Agnes got The Saints' Way (The Saints' Way is a book that everyone in Mount Blessing gets when they turn twelve; it is given by the leader Emmanuel), she has changed. Agnes now abides by all the rules in Mount Blessing, and she goes by whatever Emmanuel says. Honey on the other hand, never listens to Emmanuel or Veronica, never follows the rules and hates living at Mount Blessing. Whenever they, or anyone, do something wrong they are sent to the \"regulation room\". There they get whipped by Emmanuel and Veronica. Everything stays this way until Nana Pete, Agnes' grandmother, shows up unexpectedly and finds out the truth behind Mount Blessing. He and Norah tracked the trails of the butterflies by tagging the wings of thousands of individual butterflies. They founded the first Insect Migration Association, today known as Monarch Watch, and recruited hundreds of volunteers - \"citizen scientists\" who helped in their research by tagging butterflies and reporting findings and sightings. The Urquharts raised thousands of monarchs at their home in Scarborough, Ontario, as well as using the facilities of the University of Toronto to analyze their findings and do research.
