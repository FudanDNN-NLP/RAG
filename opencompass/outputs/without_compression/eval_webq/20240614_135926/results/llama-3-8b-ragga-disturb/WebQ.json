It is important to note that for all practical purposes, English is Jamaica's native language. When the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century Jamaica was linguistically a blank slate. The country came under English jurisdiction and the incoming new colonists were English. English became the de facto language because there was no other language there at the time. The native Arawak (Taino) had long disappeared, and with the arrival of the English in 1655 the few Spanish settlers on the island fled to Cuba. The thousands of West African slaves that would be brought in for labour on the island's notorious sugar plantations of the eighteenth century had not yet arrived. Jamaican patois \n\n Jamaican Maroon language, Maroon Spirit language, Kromanti, Jamaican Maroon Creole or Deep patwa is a ritual language and formerly mother tongue of Jamaican Maroons. It is an English-based creole with a strong Akan component, specifically from the Fante dialect of the Central Region of Ghana. It is distinct from usual Jamaican Creole, being similar to the creoles of Sierra Leone (Krio) and Suriname such as Sranan and Ndyuka. It is also more purely Akan than regular Patois, with little to no contribution from other African languages. Today, the Maroon Spirit language is used by Jamaican Maroons (largely Coromantees). Another distinct ritual language (also called Kromanti) \n\n into being when the island's burgeoning sugar industry created a large demand for field labour. The incoming African slave labourers—who spoke many various languages themselves—and the English speaking plantocracy communicated through the formation of a contact creole language unique to Jamaica. Today we know this creole as patois, and even those Jamaicans who don't speak it on a daily basis can speak it fluently, and fully understand it. Jamaican patois is sometimes written (in song lyrics, reported speech in books and newspapers for example) but because of the lack of standardization, many words may be spelled in many different ways. Standard English is taught in Jamaican schools, although teachers may speak to pupils and their parents in patois outside of the classroom.\n\n the native languages of the many ethnic and cultural groups within the Caribbean including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian and English along with several African languages. Some islands have Creole dialects influenced by their linguistic diversity; French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese and others. Jamaican Patois is also spoken in Costa Rica and French Creole is spoken in Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana in South America. Often these patois are popularly considered \"broken English\" or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a Creole language; in fact, in the Francophone Caribbean the analogous term for local basilectal languages is créole (see also Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole). \n\n In Jamaica, everyone is able to speak and understand the vernacular patois (or Patwa), a centuries-old English derived creole. Many also understand and can speak \"standard\" English; however, in common everyday oral usage, people generally use one or the other exclusively, according to social status and formal education. In everyday commerce, business, banking, media and government—in short, the entire private and public sector—acrolect English is used. This has resulted in a diglossia situation. Situational code-switching, style shifting and code-alternation occur continuously, seamlessly in communication between all Jamaicans of all classes and in all situations, in all speech acts. Recently, Jamaican patois has gone through a process of decreolization, similar to that which happened with AAVE due to the basilect creole variety developing \n\nQuestion: what does jamaican people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Like the Federalists, the Whigs were especially strong in Kent and Sussex County, but were nearly matched by the new Democratic Party majority in New Castle. The upstate /downstate competition continued as before, just under new names. Polk first represented Sussex County, and served two terms in the State House in the 1814 and 1815 sessions. After moving to Kent County he was elected to the State House again, this time from Kent County. He served two more terms in the 1818 and 1824 \n\n Tyler was unfazed when the Whig-controlled Senate rejected his treaty by a vote of 16–35 in June 1844; he felt that annexation was now within reach by joint resolution rather than by treaty, and made that request to the congress. Former President Andrew Jackson, a staunch supporter of annexation, persuaded Polk to welcome Tyler back into the Democratic Party and ordered Democratic editors to cease their attacks on him. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Polk's narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution. Tyler announced in his annual message to Congress that \"a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declared in favor of immediate annexation\". In late February 1845, the House approved a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas by a substantial margin—the Senate approved by a bare 27–25 majority, and three days before the end of his term, Tyler signed the bill into law. After some debate, Texas accepted the terms and entered the union on December 29, 1845, as the 28th state.\n\n Polk was also elected to the Kent County Levy Court in 1819. In 1824 he was elected to the State Senate and served one term including the 1825, 1826 and 1827 sessions. He was the Speaker in the 1826 session. In 1826, the Federalist Party selected Polk as their candidate for governor, and after a hard-fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the Democratic-Republican candidate, David Hazzard. He served one term as Governor of Delaware from January 16, 1827 to January 19, 1830. Legislation was passed in 1829 that called for the creation of school districts in each hundred throughout the state, with small schools placed within \n\n James K. Polk was the 11th president of the United States. He was also the governor of Tennessee from 1839 to 1841. He was a devout follower of Jacksonian democratic values.

James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 – June 15, 1849) was the 11th president of the United States (1845–1849). Polk was born in North Carolina. He later lived in and became Governor of the state of Tennessee. A Democrat, and an ardent supporter of Andrew Jackson, Polk served as Speaker of the House (1835–1839) and Governor of Tennessee (1839–1841) before becoming president. During his single four-year term, Polk accomplished every major goal that he set for his administration and successfully managed the Mexican–American War, obtaining for the United States most of its present contiguous land area. \n\nQuestion: what did james k polk do before he was president?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Chris Dormer played the role from 1970 to 1972 when the 7-year-old actor was written out of the soap due to his parents' emigration to Canada. He did not continue to act and reflected on his time as the young Peter in 2001, \"I really enjoyed the Street. I remember Pat Phoenix and Julie Goodyear kissing and tickling me because they thought I was cute. Most of the actors were nice, but some weren't. Violet Carson, who played Ena Sharples, was very grumpy. She didn't like children and really scared me.\" On-screen Peter and his sister Susan were written out of the soap to live with their grandparents when their mother Valerie Barlow was killed off. One of the seven actors who has portrayed the character is Linus Roache, the real-life son of William Roache who portrays Peter's father, Ken Barlow in the programme. Linus returned to the show in 2010, playing Lawrence Cunningham, another son of Ken Barlow.\n\n Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) is a postman, devoted to his family, but uneasy about his son Ken (William Roache) starting on a university career and acquiring sophisticated ideas. The premature death of his wife Ida (Noel Dyson) brings the two of them together.\n\n Ken (William Roache) is the elder son of Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) and Ida Barlow (Noel Dyson). His clash with his postman father as the first university student in a traditional working-class family forms the opening situation of the series. Although he becomes a political activist with a complex love-life, some critics found the character boring. But Ken went on to become the longest-running character in any soap opera.\n\n Roache has appeared on popular television shows such as Cold Blood and Four Seasons before going on to join the cast of Coronation Street alongside his father and older brother as part of a storyline surrounding Ken Barlow and his long-lost son, played by his real-life son Linus. The characters were introduced as part of the soap's fiftieth anniversary. Linus Roache played Roache's father Laurence on Coronation Street which saw the pair's relationship strained by Laurence's attitudes towards James' homosexuality. The storyline was left open, and both executive producer Phil Collinson and William Roache have expressed interest in revisiting the story in the future. He then appeared in The Road to Coronation Street, playing a younger version of his father William Roache during the time Coronation Street creator Tony Warren was attempting to bring the soap to television. It was announced on 20 December 2010 that Roache would be joining the cast of Coronation Street full-time in 2011 reprising the role of James Cunningham.

The Government of Israel bestowed the honor of the Righteous Among the Nations to Chiune Sugihara in 1985 and to Ho Feng Shan in 2001. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and China in 1992, the connection between the Jewish people and Shanghai has been recognised in various ways. In 2007, the Israeli consulate-general in Shanghai donated 660,000 Yuan, provided by 26 Israeli companies, to community projects in Hongkou District, in recognition of the safe harbour provided by the ghetto. The only Jewish monument in Shanghai is located at Huoshan Park (formerly Rabin Park) in Hongkou District.\n\n in May 1940. The exact number of visas given by Ho to Jewish refugees is unknown. It is known that Ho issued the 200th visa in June 1938, and signed the 1906th visa on 27 October 1938. How many Jews were saved through his actions is unknown, but given that Ho issued nearly 2,000 visas only during his first half year at his post, the number may be in the thousands. Ho died in 1997 and his actions were recognized posthumously when the Israeli organization Yad Vashem in 2000 decided to award him the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\". Many in the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish community were additionally saved by Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, Lithuania, and Jan Zwartendijk, director \n\nThe Chiune Sugihara Memorial Hall 20210723 02.jpgata Tunnel (a.k.a. \"Korea tunnel\"(朝鮮トンネル)), claimed to be a haunted location as it was constructed during World War II by Korean forced labor, some of whom died in the construction and whose bodies were allegedly buried in the walls. ; Chiune Sugihara Memorial Hall, commemorating Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara and aiming to educate Japanese citizens on the history of Judaism in Europe and Japan.

While this was not the 50,000 expected, and those who arrived did not have the expected wealth to contribute to the Japanese economy, the achievement of the plan is looked back upon favorably. Chiune Sugihara was bestowed the honor of the Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1985. In addition, the Mir Yeshiva, one of the largest centers of rabbinical study today, and the only European yeshiva to survive the Holocaust, survived as a result of these events. Inuzuka's help in rescuing Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe was acknowledged by the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States which saved him from being tried as a war criminal.

Andantino (B major, ). 3. Allegro ma non troppo ( – ). Works written in 1784 include, besides this concerto, the five piano concertos 15–19, the Quintet in E for Piano and Winds, and several piano works – the Sonata in C minor being the most noteworthy—one string quartet (the \"Hunt\"), and several sets of orchestral dances. Works by other composers who were known to Mozart from around this time include the 80th symphony (in D minor) and second cello concerto of Joseph Haydn. Michael Haydn had published two sets of quartets the year before, and Carl Stamitz and Ignaz Pleyel each wrote another set of six quartets (Pleyel released a further set in 1784.) A Pleyel cello concerto (in C) was also released at some point between 1782–84 (Pleyel being a composer whose quartets, at least, Mozart rated highly.)\n\n A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra. English horn concertos appeared about a century later than oboe solo pieces, mostly because until halfway through the 18th century different instruments (the taille de hautbois, vox humana and the oboe da caccia) had the role of the tenor or alto instrument in the oboe family. The modern English horn was developed from the oboe da caccia in the 1720s, probably in Silesia. The earliest known English horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann \n\n 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The concerto is in three movements:  Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. M. S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the coda of the finale, starting at measure 315, from 2/4 to 3/8, and subsequent thematic transformations. Joel Galand has noted that the finale, in rondo-ritornello form, avoids use of a new re-entry theme.\n\n1) Allegro, ; 2) Andante, in C major ; 3) Allegretto – Presto, The Piano Concerto No. 17 in G major, KV. 453, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was written in 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. As is typical with concerti, it is in three movements:  According to the date that the composer himself noted on the score, the concerto was completed on April 12, 1784. The date of the premiere is uncertain. In one view, the work is said to have been premiered by Mozart's student Barbara Ployer on June 13, 1784, at a concert to which Mozart had invited Giovanni \n\n Mozart composed the concerto for performance at a series of concerts at the Vienna venues of the Trattnerhof and the Burgtheater in the first quarter of 1784, where he was himself the soloist in March 1784. In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: \"'I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat one beats the one in D for difficulty.'\" Many pianists consider this to be one of the most difficult of Mozart's piano concertos. The concerto is primarily difficult from its many quick scale patterns which must be played perfectly and also from its many fast chord patterns moving up and down. Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \"grand\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble.\n\nQuestion: who did mozart write his four horn concertos for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1873, the Hopkins family purchased the 88 acre of the current village of Bear Lake, Michigan. The \n\n Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation: alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes (such as peanuts, soybeans and cowpeas). These crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption. Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that was similar to the one at Iowa State. To encourage better nutrition in \n\n Tuskegee Institute (now known as Tuskegee University), a black, largely privately funded school, laid much of the foundation for what ultimately would become Cooperative Extension work. Much of the credit for these pioneering efforts can be attributed directly to Booker T. Washington, founder of the institute, and to world-renowned agricultural researcher George Washington Carver. The first annual Tuskegee Farmer Conference, begun at the prompting of Washington in 1892, initially attracted some 500 participants. Still held annually, the conference is regarded not only as the cornerstone of black agricultural outreach work but as a major milestone in the development of Cooperative Extension work in general Nevertheless, much like their counterparts at nearby API and in other and other land-grant institutions, Washington and Carver understood that the insights generated at Tuskegee and other agricultural research facilities throughout the nation could not be fully utilized unless they were successfully imparted to farmers.\n\n George Washington Earle was born in Truxton, New York in 1849. In 1851, his family moved to Huntley, Illinois, and when he was only ten years old Gerge left home on his own. He hired out on a Wisconsin farm owned by Dr. Rollin S. Wooster in 1860, and in 1863 moved with Wooster to Iowa. Earle attended school, and eventually acquired enough education that he became a schoolteacher. However, he was unsatisfied, and in 1868 returned to New York and began doing piecework in a sash and door factory, continuing until he had saved enough money to attend medical college. In 1872, Earle gradualted from Buffalo Medical College, receiving his diploma from Millard Fillmore. He moved \n\n George Washington Carver (c. undefined 1864 – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion. He was the most prominent black scientist of the early 20th century. While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. Although he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts, none became commercially successful. Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism. \n\nQuestion: where was george washington carver from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its basic elements are simple to understand. Take a group of people. Randomly assign them to one of two groups. One receives the real medicine; the other gets a placebo, and the researchers and the patients alike are blind to which is which. Every pill we take, every nasal spray or medical patch we use, has been subjected to the judgment of the blind protocol. It is the price demanded by the Food and Drug Administration before the gates to the American drug market will open.\nDoing science this way is important because what researchers want or expect can influence what they observe, or how they interpret what their data says. If no one knows what he’s observing until the data collection and analysis are completed, then the potential for bias is eliminated. That is why the blind protocol has become the gold standard of the life sciences. But where did the idea come from? Even scientists are surprised to learn that it was created by Benjamin Franklin.\nWe don’t often think of Franklin’s scientific research except in terms of his work on electricity. But beyond his electrical work, diplomacy, and statesmanship, he’s also historically significant for his contributions to a half-dozen other disciplines. He was the first meteorologist in America, the first geographer, the first oceanographer, an inventor of medical apparatus, and, least known of all, the first parapsychologist—a student of extraordinary and anomalous human functioning. It was in this last capacity that he created the blind protocol.\nIn 1778 Franklin was in Paris, as America’s ambassador to the court of King Louis XVI, when the eighteenth century’s greatest medical rogue, Franz Anton Mesmer, arrived from Vienna, in a cloud of celebrity and controversy. Mesmer had left Vienna in a hurry. He had been asked to treat Marie Paradies, a pianist who appears to have suffered from hysterical blindness. After she received his treatment, her eyesight was temporarily restored, but the change was so overwhelming that it shattered her nerves and she lost the ability to play her instrument. Unhappily for Mesmer, Marie Paradies was the goddaughter 66 of the Austro-Hungarian empress, Maria Theresa, and the empress took umbrage at what had happened. Mesmer prudently decamped to Paris, which was where he encountered Franklin.\nWell-trained in both medicine and theology, Mesmer was a charming, rational, cultivated man; he commissioned several works composed by Mozart. But he also had a flamboyantly theatrical style and more than a whiff of the con; he had startling theories of illness and disturbing and erotically tinged methods of treatment.\nHis patients, known as sommambules , were described by one observer as mostly “hysterical bourgeois women,” and he treated them in group “magnetic séances.” Like many eighteenth-century intellectuals, Mesmer was interested in alchemy and astrology, and he cloaked his treatments in the symbols of these already contested fields. The sommambules sat holding hands around a large wooden tub filled with powdered glass and magnetized iron filings. They were relaxed and brought into rapport by the sweet haunting tones of the glass harmonica, an instrument invented, coincidentally, by Franklin. The glass harmonica was played behind a curtain covered with astrological symbols, and it produced ethereal sounds that were the eighteenth century’s equivalent of modern electronic consciousness music. After a while Mesmer, cloaked by a long purple robe, would sweep into the room. The effect was dramatic. In a performance that was a cross between that of a modern entertainment hypnotist and a psychotherapist, he would talk the sommambules into a deep trance and give them healing suggestions. Then he would touch them with a white metal wand, sometimes rubbing them. And finally he would command them to awaken, rested and cured. It often worked, and Mesmer’s success made him popular with laypeople and feared by the medical establishment.\nHow Mesmer discovered the fundamentals of hypnotism and stumbled onto the rudiments of the psychophysical self-regulation that lies at the core of such modern treatments as psychotherapy, hypnotism, and biofeedback is unknown. It may be that he just observed that a relaxed trance state produced a kind of anesthesia that gave subjects physiological control over their bodies and minds. However it happened, he seems to have sincerely believed he had discovered a cure for all illnesses.\nIt is clear, though, that he had no real insight into why the trances worked. Still, he seems to have understood from the beginning that he needed an explanatory model, and his doctoral dissertation, De Planetarium Influxu (\"On the Influence of the Planets\"), which he published in 1766, attempted to provide one. In its 48 pages he connected hypnotism with a kind of primitive description of cyclical activity in the biosphere, such as heat waves or storms; electricity; magnetism; and even a variant on Newton’s understanding of gravity. He later named the resulting model gravitas animalis , or magnetismus animalis —animal magnetism.\nWhat was called for, he realized, was some sort of impartial test. The patients were literally blindfolded.\nIt gave the effects he achieved a certain gloss, electricity, magnetism, and gravity being the high-prestige research areas of the day. We now know that he plagiarized much of this from one of the most prominent and well-regarded English physicians of the previous generation, Richard Meade (1673-1754). He also mixed in some alchemy, proposing that there existed a universal “fluid” in all living forms that could flow from one organism to another and affect a patient’s health. It wasn’t the first time observable phenomena were linked to absurd explanation, and as time went on, Mesmer became more and more invested in it, even as it caused him to be increasingly shunned by more conventional healers.\nWhen he arrived in Paris, the French medical establishment, alarmed as much by his entrepreneurial success as by his unfounded theories, denied him a license to practice medicine in the city. He got around it by partnering with a disciple, the already licensed Charles d’Eslon. Mesmer was soon at the height of Paris society, collecting followers who included the young French aristocrat and American Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette, as well as no less a patron than the queen, Marie Antoinette. He was lionized by the glamorous, and Mozart made references to him and his magnets in his comic opera Così; Fan Tutte . So great was his popularity that his name quickly entered the language, in the form of the verb mesmerize .\nBy 1784, six years later, Mesmer felt secure enough to propose building a hospital for animal magnetism treatments, and he quickly raised 340,000 livres, a prodigious sum. This development, his ever-greater fame, his sway over the queen, and the constant lobbying against him by established physicians finally prompted King Louis to establish a commission to investigate his claims.\nIn March 1784 four doctors were selected, among them Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, for whom the guillotine was named. The four physicians asked the Academy of Sciences to add some scientists to their number, and five were chosen, including Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen, and Franklin, known throughout the world as the man who had discovered electricity. The king asked Franklin to head the commission.\nFranklin was by now arguably the most famous man in the Western world. When Jefferson went to Paris to replace him, he wrote that “more respect and veneration [was] attached to the character of Dr. Franklin than to that of any other person, foreign or native.” He was also a man who lived in considerable pain. He suffered from gout, boils, and decades of hard living and was mostly confined to his house in Passy, a mile from Paris and seven miles from the king’s seat at Versailles. Why he took the assignment is not clear. It may be he felt obligated to the king. He had just talked Louis, the most autocratic and traditional monarch in Europe, into funding a war of liberation fought by the most revolutionary democracy in the world. Or it may be that whatever the condition of his body, his mind and his curiosity were as vigorous as ever.\nFranklin was not up to traveling when the commission began its work, so the first meetings were held without him and without his thoughts about how such an evaluation should be undertaken. Since Mesmer himself could not practice medicine, the commissioners went to d’Eslon’s clinic, where they found a handsome dimly lit room in the center of which stood the wooden tub with its pulverized glass and iron filings. In place of Mesmer’s glass harmonica, a piano in the corner provided music. The patients were seated on chairs around the tub, linked together by cords and each holding the next person’s thumb. Long jointed iron rods projected from the tub; they could be touched to any part of a patient’s body. D’Eslon explained to the commissioners that the tub was the condenser and conductor of the animal magnetism. As they watched, he walked among the patients, touching one or another with a short iron rod and rubbing his hands over their bodies, particularly their lower abdomens.\nThe treatment went on for hours, and the tension in the room grew. Nervous coughs, hiccups, hysterical cries, sobs, and even convulsions were observed, and d’Eslon explained that they were signs that healing was taking place. Nothing was controlled, and the commissioners left with no sense of what might have taken place medically. After attending a number of such sessions, the commissioners, little more enlightened than when they’d begun, passed on their findings to Franklin.\nHe saw none of this as very useful. He might believe in reincarnation and practice meditation, but he never confused interest with evidence. What was called for, he realized, was some kind of impartial test, and since he could not go to them, he arranged for the other commissioners and d’Eslon to come to him. In late April and early May and at least once in June, they came out from Paris to gather at his residence in Passy.\nAmong his other accomplishments, Franklin seems to have been the first scientist to consider demographics. On the theory that class and culture might help explain what was happening, and to allow comparisons between populations, the first session at Passy involved only lower-class patients, whose presence Franklin seems to have arranged. They included an asthmatic widow, a woman with a swollen thigh, a tubercular six-year-old boy, a nine-year-old girl who suffered from St. Vitus’s Dance, a man blind in one eye from a tumor, a woman who had been thrown by a cow and never fully recovered, and a man whose reason for being included is not recorded. After several hours, four of the seven were not affected at all by d’Eslon’s treatments; the remaining three mainly experienced discomfort from having their sore spots pressed. No cures were achieved.\nA few days later the commissioners arranged for four upper-class people to be treated: a Madame de Bory and a Monsieur Romagni, neither of whom had symptoms, or none listed, anyway; a Monsieur Moret, who had a tumor on his knee; and a Madame de V., who had some kind of nervous disorder. To this group were added Franklin, his grandsons, his secretary, an American officer, and a group of patients of d’Eslon.\nDe Bory and Romagni felt nothing, nor did Franklin, the grandchildren, or the American officer. Madame de V. almost fell asleep, although whether from hypnotism or treatment is unclear. D’Eslon’s patients were more responsive, which was not surprising. Franklin then suggested what became the first use of blindness and sham treatments in a scientific test.\nThe d’Eslon patients were literally blindfolded—which is why the protocol came to be known as “blind”—and the treatments continued. As Franklin had hoped, this was very revealing. The patients could not tell when they were being “magnetized” and often thought they were when they’weren’t, or vice versa.\nDuring another session at Franklin’s house they went out into the garden. Mesmer maintained, and d’Eslon agreed, that any living thing could be magnetized, and d’Eslon offered (or more likely Franklin asked for) a demonstration. D’Eslon touched an apricot tree in the garden with his wand, supposedly magnetizing it, and said that afterward anyone who touched the tree would be affected. Franklin, once again, saw the matter not as a question of belief but of getting unbiased evidence.\nOn August 11 Franklin’s commission issued its unanimous report. Mesmerism was dead, and Mesmer soon left Paris.\nD‘eslon was asked to stand several yards away from the tree. Then a 12-year-old boy was blindfolded and led out into the garden. He was taken to stand in front of four trees, three controls and the treated one. At the first tree the boy began to perspire and cough. At the second he said he felt pain in his head and tiredness in his body. At the third he said his headache was much worse and volunteered that he felt he was getting close to the magnetized tree. In fact he was moving away from it. At the fourth tree he fainted, requiring d’Eslon to revive him.\nFranklin and the other members of the commission in attendance were satisfied that the experiments conducted at his house, under the conditions of blindness he had devised, had settled the question of whether animal magnetism was real. It was not.\nOn August 11 they issued their unanimous report to the king. Benjamin Franklin’s signature stood first, and such was his preeminence that throughout Europe and America scientists and laypeople alike felt that it had been he who had settled the issue. Ever after, history has known this study as the Franklin Commission. Mesmerism was dead, and Mesmer soon left Paris. He was lucky. Ten years later Lavoisier would lose his head to the guillotine, and Dr. Guillotin just barely missed going under its blade too. Mesmer ended up in Switzerland, largely forgotten, and years later he died there in poverty.\nAlthough Mesmerism itself died out, the importance of Franklin’s blind protocol was not lost. In 1799 the English physician John Haygarth took the next step with the development of true placebo treatments. The Franklin protocol had compared treatment and no treatment, under blind conditions. Haygarth refined the idea when he was asked to evaluate a medical device invented by a Connecticut doctor, Elisha Perkins. Like Mesmer’s treatments, Perkins’s were based on the manipulation of a mysterious energy.\nWith that addition, the trail blazed by Franklin and his commission has grown to become the roadway in science that largely determines what medicines we take, what chemicals can be used in our environment, and whether we can trust an experiment’s results.\n\n By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called \"pulse hammer\" (Pulshammer). In 1767 Benjamin Franklin visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it. Franklin's pulse hammer consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor. Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb. In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird. See: In 1881 Israel L. Landis got \n\n Since at least 1738, a musical instrument called a Glasspiel or verrillon, created by filling beer glasses with varying amounts of water, was popular in Europe. The beer glasses were struck by wooden mallets shaped like spoons to produce \"church and other solemn music\". Benjamin Franklin was sufficiently impressed by a verrillon performance on a visit to London in 1757 that he created his own instrument, the glass armonica, in 1762. Franklin's armonica inspired several other instruments, including two created by Chladni. In 1791, Chladni invented the musical instrument called the euphon (not to be confused with the brass instrument euphonium), consisting of glass rods of different pitches. Chladni's euphon is the direct ancestor of the modern day musical instrument known as the Cristal Baschet. Chladni also improved on Hooke's \"musical cylinder\" to produce another instrument, the clavicylinder, in 1799. Chladni travelled throughout Europe with his instruments giving demonstrations.\n\n Benjamin Franklin ( –  April 17, 1790) was an American polymath who was active as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first United States postmaster general. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia's first fire department, and the \n\n Franklin was a prodigious inventor.

Richard Milhous Nixon, (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the United States from 1969 to 1974. Nixon's political career started as a California representative. He was Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president for two terms and was defeated in 1960 by John F. Kennedy for the presidential election. In 1968, Nixon won the presidency and was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1972. Nixon was the only person to be elected twice to both the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.

Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded. The reorganization of the Belgian army that had begun in 1913 was only due to be completed in 1926. Consequently at the outbreak of war, the Belgian army was under-strength and largely unprepared. Albert I took personal command of the 265,000-strong Belgian army. However, they could do little against the 1.5 million-strong German invading force. Between August and October 1914, the Germans took the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and occupied \n\n overwhelm the Belgian military and then move quickly through the country and then towards Paris. The general staff believed that none of the signatories would be willing to honor their commitments from the 1839 Treaty of London, which a German diplomat dismissed as a \"scrap of paper\". On 2 August 1914, following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards. Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by the Germans the same day. \n\n  Following its independence in 1830, Belgium had been obliged to remain neutral in perpetuity by an 1839 treaty as part of a guarantee for its independence. Before the war, Belgium was a constitutional monarchy and was noted for being one of the most industrialised countries in the world. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west. Large numbers of refugees also fled to neighbouring countries. In October 1914, the German advance was \n\n  At the start of World War I, Albert refused to comply with Germany's request for safe passage for its troops through Belgium in order to attack France, which the Germans alleged was about to advance into Belgium en route to attacking Germany in support of Russia. In fact, the French government had told its army commander not to go into Belgium before a German invasion. The German invasion brought Britain into the war as one of the guarantors of Belgian neutrality under the Treaty of 1839. King Albert, as prescribed by the Belgian constitution, took personal command of the Belgian Army, and held the Germans off long enough for Britain and France to prepare for the Battle of the Marne (6–9 \n\n The German occupation of Belgium (Occupation allemande, Duitse bezetting) of World War I was a military occupation of Belgium by the forces of the German Empire between 1914 and 1918. Beginning in August 1914 with the invasion of neutral Belgium, the country was almost completely overrun by German troops before the winter of the same year as the Allied forces withdrew westwards. The Belgian government went into exile, while King Albert I and the Belgian Army continued to fight on a section of the Western Front. Under the German military, Belgium was divided into three separate administrative zones.

On July 27, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins \"edged Attorney General Drew Edmondson in the Democratic primary by fewer than six-tenths of 1 percent — about 1,500 votes — with all but three of the state's 2,244 precincts reporting unofficial results.\" \"Edmondson threw his support to Askins in a concession speech that resolved a tightly run contest. In the speech, Edmondson stated, \"To her credit and mine, this primary has been one on the issues, on the record, clean, positive, straightforward. ... I think it will be written down in the history books as a testament to both Jari Askins and Drew Edmondson that the Democratic Party comes out of this primary united and unfractured and ready to win this state.\"\n\n Incumbent Democrat John Glenn won re-election to a fourth term, coinciding with Bill Clinton's narrow win during the presidential election. Glenn's voting percentage of 51% over Republican Lieutenant Governor of Ohio Mike DeWine represented the worst performance of his four runs for the Senate, likely due to the presence of third-party candidate Martha Grevatt of the far-left Workers World Party. , this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from Ohio.\n\n Incumbent Republican Mike DeWine won re-election to a second term, beating Democrat Ted Celeste, real estate developer and brother of former Ohio Governor Dick Celeste.\n\n Two-term Governor John Kasich was term-limited, as Ohio does not allow governors to serve three consecutive terms. Attorney General Mike DeWine and Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor ran for the Republican nomination, which DeWine won. Former U.S. Representative and two-time presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, Ohio Attorney General and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray, and state Senator Joe Schiavoni ran for the Democratic nomination, which was won by Cordray. Green Party nominee for State House in 2016 Constance Gadell-Newton declared her candidacy. Filmmaker and comedian Travis Irvine was the Libertarian Party's candidate for governor. DeWine won the election.\n\n The 2014 Ohio gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2014. Incumbent Republican Governor John Kasich won reelection to a second term in office by a landslide over Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald and Green Party candidate Anita Rios. Primary elections were held on May 6, 2014. Despite FitzGerald's massive defeat, he is as of 2018 the last Democrat to carry the historically Democratic Monroe County, which voted for Republican candidate Mike DeWine four years later. Kasich's landslide victory gave him the highest percentage of the vote since George Voinovich's win in 1994, a large improvement from his narrow victory in 2010. As of 2022, this is the last time the counties of Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Lucas voted for the Republican candidate.\n\nQuestion: who is governor of ohio 2011?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Johnson was dominated by the Vietnam War and the Cold War, a period of sustained geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Johnson took over after the assassination promising to keep Kennedy's policies and his team. The U.S. had stationed advisory military personnel in South Vietnam since the 1950s, but Johnson presided over a major escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, he obtained congressional approval to use military force to repel future attacks by North Vietnam. The number of U.S. soldiers increased from 16,700 soldiers when Johnson took office to over 500,000 \n\n numerous minor diplomatic missions. In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination. As president, Johnson retained senior Kennedy cabinet appointees including Kennedy's younger brother Robert F. Kennedy as Attorney General. Succeeding to the presidency just about a year before the 1964 presidential election, Johnson launched War on poverty and signed Clean Air Act as his initial legislation. Before the primaries begun, Johnson made use of his experience in legislative politics to help pass the Civil Rights Bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1964.\n\n The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. They defeated Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater and vice presidential nominee William Miller. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right. Despite Johnson's uncertainty about running, he was seen as the most likely candidate to get the nomination. He entered the primaries starting with New Hampshire and won the state by almost 29,000 votes. Johnson's main opponent \n\nOn August 27, 1973, the US Post Office issued the 8-cent Lyndon B. Johnson memorial postage stamp, first placed on sale at the Post Office in Austin, Texas. The stamp was designed by Bradbury Thompson. ; Johnson's last appearance (to date) on a U.S. postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on one of the AMERIPEX issues of 1986. Lyndon B. Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973) was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969, served as vice president during the Kennedy administration. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Johnson assumed the presidency. He won election to a full term, in 1964 with 61 percent of the vote and served until January 20, 1969.\n\n Johnson went from his victory in the 1964 election to launch the Great Society program at home, signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and starting the War on Poverty. He also escalated the Vietnam War, which significantly reduced his popularity. As he had served less than 24 months of Kennedy's term, he was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under 22nd Amendment. Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him. Johnson's internal polling showed his trailing to Kennedy. On March 31, 1968, Johnson shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\" While campaigning, Kennedy was assassinated shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After Kennedy's assassination, the Democratic party nominated Vice president Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. Humphrey later lost the election to former vice president Richard Nixon.\n\nQuestion: who was vice president after kennedy died?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines.  Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome.  Given the uncertain health effects of low-dose radiation, cancer deaths cannot be ruled out. However, studies by the World Health Organisation and Tokyo University have shown that no discernible increase in the rate of cancer deaths is expected. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged in the academic literature from none to hundreds.\n\nMany deaths are attributed to the evacuation and subsequent long-term displacement following emergency mass evacuation.  For evacuation, the estimated number of deaths during and immediately after transit range from 34 to \"greater than 50\". The victims include hospital inpatients and elderly people at nursing facilities who died from causes such as hypothermia, deterioration of underlying medical problems, and dehydration.\n\nFor long-term displacement, many people (mostly sick and elderly) died at an increased rate while in temporary housing and shelters.  Degraded living conditions and separation from support networks are likely contributing factors.  , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. \"Disaster-related deaths\" are deaths attributed to disasters and are not caused by direct physical trauma, but does not distinguish between people displaced by the nuclear disaster compared to the earthquake / tsunami.  As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. Reports have pointed out that many of these deaths may have been caused by the evacuation period being too long, and that residents could have been allowed to return to their homes earlier in order to reduce the total related death toll. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”.\n\nAt least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 175 (0.7%) have received significant radiation doses. Workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. After hearing opinions from a panel of radiologists and other experts, the ministry ruled that the man's family should be paid compensation.\n\nThe Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima.\n\nSummary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.\n\nAs the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.\n\nIn the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.\n\nConcerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.\n\nJapanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.\n\nRadiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\".\n\nReports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.\n\nUNSCEAR Report \nAnnex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv).  About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35).  No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38).  Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30).  No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39).  Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv.\n\nWHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.\n\nThe WHO calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, infants, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of cancer (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for thyroid cancer, due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%]. Cancer risks for the unborn child are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.\n\nThe estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.\nAbout one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.\n\nNo increase is expected in the incidence of congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to within the womb radiation exposure. As no radiation induced inherited effects/heritable effects, nor teratogenic effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received radiotherapy, and the children of the Hibakusha, not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants.\n\nOther reports\n\nMajor news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from \"disaster conditions\" following the earthquake. \"The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\"\n\nA Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster.  They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone.\n\nOn 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.\n\nIn a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.\n\nThe wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high.\n\nAccording to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.\n\nIn April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the US, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.\n\n, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.\n\nWorkers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat. , 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure.\n\n, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases. A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.\n\nAccording to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by \"fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster\".\n\nAccording to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.\n\nThese numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.\n\nFinally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died.\nThose who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster.\n\nThe author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. In their final 1981 report, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.\n\nAnother cause of death is the increased number of suicides due to mental stress, despair, anxiety and depression caused by media coverage, and through long periods of evacuation.\n\nPerinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.\n\nSee also\n List of civilian nuclear accidents\n Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents\n Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English\n Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report\n Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report – An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012\n Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4\n Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company\n Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building\n TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company\n NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan\n JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum\n JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency\n IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency\n Nature Journal – Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis\n TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake\n Documentary photographs: residential damage within \"No Go\" Zone\n In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012\n PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster   \n \"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n 2011 earthquake. Due to damages like these, the Fukushima plant released nuclear material into the Pacific Ocean and has continued to do so.

Along the same coastline, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) found trace amounts of Fukushima contaminates 100 miles (150 km) off of the coast of Eureka, California in November 2014.

In 2008, after the opening of 7 brand new nuclear reactors in Japan (3 on Honshū, and 1 each on Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Tanegashima) Japan became the third largest nuclear power user in the world with 55 nuclear reactors. These provide 34.5% of Japan's electricity. Following an earthquake, tsunami, and the failure of cooling systems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on March 11, 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. 140,000 residents within 20 km of the plant were evacuated.

They also have a grid of emergency backup generators to provide power in the event of an outage. An event that could prevent both offsite power, as well as emergency power is known as a \"station blackout\". In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused a loss of electric power at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. The decay heat could not be removed, and the reactor cores of units 1, 2 and 3 overheated, the nuclear fuel melted, and the containments were breached. Radioactive materials were released from the plant to the atmosphere and to the ocean.\n\n In 2013, contaminated groundwater was found in-between some of the affected turbine buildings in the Fukushima Daiichi facility, including locations at bordering seaports that led into the Pacific Ocean. In both locations, the facility typically expulses clean water to feed into further groundwater systems. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the entity that manages and operates the facility, further investigated the contamination in areas that would deem safe to conduct operations. They found that a significant amount of the contamination originated from underground cable trenches that connected to circulation pumps within the facility.

Between 1889 and 1975 Scotland was divided into burghs and counties, which were replaced by regions and districts. Since 1996, for the purposes of local government, Scotland has been divided into 32 council areas. Rockall, a small and uninhabitable rocky islet in the North Atlantic, was annexed by the UK in 1955 and later declared part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972. However, the legality of this claim is disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland and it is probably unenforceable in international law. As one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, Scotland is represented by Members of Parliament at the Parliament of the United \n\n Scotland were legally united by the Acts of Union 1707, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain. However, this union preserved institutions, customs and legal traditions peculiar to Scotland. For example, the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian Church) and Scots law were preserved, while no separate church or legal system for Wales remained. England and Wales integrated, while Scotland retained many of its unique institutions and traditions. To this day, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (the majority of Ireland broke away as the Irish Free State in 1922, which later became the modern Republic of Ireland) remain separate legal jurisdictions within the UK. There are also three Crown dependencies of the UK – the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey – for which the British monarch is responsible but which have not had formal Acts of Union.\n\n The early modern predecessors of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Ireland and later including Scotland) included both an accessory union and aeque principali union. The union between England and Wales was an accessory union. English rules and laws were granted to Wales in the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543, and Wales was thus absorbed into the Kingdom of England. The Lordship and later Kingdom of Ireland were ruled separately in a personal union with the Kingdom of England (and Scotland after 1603; Great Britain after 1707) until they were legally united by the Acts of Union 1800, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Ireland retained its own legal system, which continues today as Northern Irish Law. The Kingdoms of England and Ireland were united with Scotland in a personal union from 1603 (Union of the crowns).

It is the third and final instalment in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation based on the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, following An Unexpected Journey (2012) and The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and together, they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. It was produced by New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros. Pictures and WingNut Films. Warner Bros. served also as the distributor. The Battle of the Five Armies premiered in London on 1 December 2014, and was then released on 11 December 2014 in New Zealand, 12 December 2014 in the United \n\n A teaser trailer for the film was released on 28 July 2014 attached to Guardians of the Galaxy, Into the Storm, and If I Stay. The second theatrical trailer was released on 6 November 2014 attached to Interstellar and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. To promote the film's release, Wellington-based association football club, Wellington Phoenix, wore a special designed jersey to commemorate the opening of The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies. The custom, film-themed jersey was worn only once, on 13 December 2014. In the film's Japanese release on 13 December, Warner Bros. collaborated with mobile gaming company A-Lim to bring Bilbo, Gandalf, and Legolas into the game Brave Frontier at the end of December as Vortex Dungeon units. The campaign only ran until February 2015. Smaug made a guest appearance, animated by WETA and voiced again by Cumberbatch, on the satire show The Colbert Report on 12 December 2014 to promote the film.\n\n (2003), the final wearers of the Three Rings—Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel, appear openly at the Grey Havens wearing the Three, with Galadriel proclaiming the end of its power and the beginning of the Dominion of Men. Four Rings of Power appeared in Jackson's The Hobbit film series. In An Unexpected Journey (2012), the One Ring was found by Bilbo Baggins (portrayed by Martin Freeman). In the extended version of the succeeding film The Desolation of Smaug (2013), Gandalf discovers that Sauron took the Ring of Thrór (a Dwarf-Lord) from Thráin (Antony Sher), who revealed in a flashback \n\n  In the 1977 animated version of The Hobbit, Thorin is voiced by Hans Conried. In Soviet 1985 television play Сказочное путешествие мистера Бильбо Беггинса Хоббита (\"The Fantastic Journey of the Hobbit Mr. Bilbo Baggins\") Thorin was played by Anatoly Ravikovich. In Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Hobbit (2012–2014), Thorin is portrayed by Richard Armitage. The film adaptation adds to Thorin's quest an arch-enemy in the form of the villainous orc leader Azog, as well as a history of enmity with Thranduil which began with a dispute between his grandfather Thrór and the Elvenking over the White Gems of Lasgalen. In his review, Erik Kain from Forbes wrote that Thorin stood out as a remarkable character with shades of dark and light, at once heroic and stubborn to a fault. In the 1982 game The Hobbit Thorin appears as an AI controlled character and one of his seemingly random actions (\"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold\", which occurs when the player does nothing for a while) became quite famous. In the 2003 video game, Thorin is voiced by Clive Revill.\n\n Bilbo is played by Ian Holm, who had played Frodo in the BBC radio series 20 years earlier. Throughout the 2003 video game The Hobbit, the players control Bilbo, voiced by Michael Beattie. The game follows the plot of the book, but adds the elements of platform gameplay and various side-objectives along the main quests. In The Lord of the Rings Online (2007) Bilbo resides in Rivendell, mostly playing riddle games with the Elf Lindir in the Hall of Fire. In Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film series, a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the young Bilbo is portrayed by Martin Freeman while Ian Holm reprises his role as an older Bilbo in An Unexpected Journey (2012) and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).\n\nQuestion: who plays bilbo baggins in the hobbit?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She has been called a civil rights hero for her tenacity in soothing the spirit of her pastor, Martin Luther King Jr. Pollard was an elder of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, during the time of the bus boycott. It was a seminal event in the civil rights movement that produced a political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system in Montgomery. King recounted in his writings that after several weeks of walking to her destinations rather than take the bus, he suggested to Mother Pollard, then about 72, that she might take the bus again for the sake of her health. She replied, \"My feets is tired, but my soul is rested.\" She was dubbed \"Mother\" because of her age; her real first name is unknown.\n\n students; the only black people on campus were the nonacademic workers who served students and faculty. King came during a time when Duke was starting to take part in the activism that had already taken place at many of its contemporary institutions in the North and West. In 1962, six years prior to the Reverend's speech at Duke University, the university's graduate schools had finally desegregated according to a vote by the Board of Trustees; one year later, five African-American undergraduates matriculated at Duke. In 1966, Samuel DuBois Cook became the first tenured black faculty member, while an undergraduate group called the Afro-American Society was unofficially established to advocate for the rights of black \n\n As the center of community life, Black churches held a leadership role in the Civil Rights Movement. Their history as a focal point for the Black community and as a link between the Black and White worlds made them natural for this purpose. Martin Luther King Jr. was but one of many notable Black ministers involved in the movement. He helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957), serving as its first president. King received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through non-violent civil disobedience. He was assassinated in 1968. Ralph David Abernathy, Bernard Lee, Fred Shuttlesworth, C.T. Vivian and Jesse Jackson are among the many notable minister-activists. They were especially important during the later years of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n On November 13, 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered a speech about the Civil Rights Movement at Duke University, declaring that \"[Human progress] comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals who are willing to be coworkers with God...The time is always right to do what is right.\" So many white and black students, faculty, workers, and administrators showed up that campus organizers had to put the speech on loudspeakers so that the overflow audience could listen outside on the Main Quad.

Under the Canadian Constitution, laws related to timekeeping are a provincial and territorial matter. Most of Saskatchewan, despite geographically being in the Mountain Time Zone, observes year-round Central Standard Time (CST). In 2020, the Yukon Territory abandoned seasonal time change to permanently observe year-round Mountain Standard Time (MST). In the regions of Canada where daylight saving time is used, it begins on the second Sunday of March at 2 a.m. and ends on the first Sunday in November at 2 a.m. As a result, daylight saving time lasts in Canada for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, or about 65 percent of the entire year.\n\n Canada and the United States of America use daylight saving time on a wide scale, with only a few states/provinces and parts thereof opting out of the practice or adopting it year-round without the twice yearly switch. The United States territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands remain in Atlantic Standard Time (AST) all year long, meaning that clocks in these regions match those in New York City during the summer and Bermuda in the winter.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus, Augustine went to Carthage to continue his education in rhetoric, though it was above the financial means of his family.

He was warned by his mother to avoid fornication (sex outside marriage), but Augustine persisted in the relationship for over fifteen years, and the woman gave birth to his son Adeodatus (372–388), which means \"Gift from God\", who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare to marry a teenaged heiress. By the time he was able to marry her, however, he had decided to become a Catholic priest and the marriage did not \n\n later, in 388, Augustine completed his apology On the Holiness of the Catholic Church. That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa. Augustine's mother Monica died at Ostia, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property. Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died. Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. He only kept the family house, which he converted into a monastic foundation for himself and a group of friends. Furthermore, while he was known for his major contributions regarding Christian rhetoric, another major contribution was his preaching style. \n\n St. Augustine (354–430), Bishop of Hippo (modern Annaba), was born at Tagaste in Numidia (modern Souk Ahras). His mother St. Monica, a pillar of faith, evidently was of Berber heritage. Augustine himself did not speak a Berber language; his use of Punic is unclear. At Carthage, Augustine received his higher education. Later, while professor of Rhetoric at Milano (then the Roman imperial capital), he pursued his belief in Manichaean teachings. Following his strong conversion to Christianity, and after his mother died at Ostia in Italia, Augustine returned to Africa. Here he served as a priest, and later as bishop of Hippo; as the author \n\n Augustine of Hippo (Aurelius Augustinus Hipponensis; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430), also known as Saint Augustine, was a theologian and philosopher of Berber origin and the bishop of Hippo Regius in Numidia, Roman North Africa. His writings influenced the development of Western philosophy and Western Christianity, and he is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church in the Patristic Period. His many important works include The City of God, On Christian Doctrine, and Confessions. According to his contemporary, Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith\". In his youth he was drawn to the major Persian religion, Manichaeism, and later to Neoplatonism.

On 11 February 2011, the president stepped down and the vice president Omar Suleiman de facto introduced the country to martial law when transferring all civilian powers from the presidential institution to the military institution. It meant that the presidential executive powers, the parliamentary legislative powers and the judicial powers all transferred directly into the military system which may delegate powers back and forth to any civilian institution within its territory. The military issued in its third announcement the \"end of the State of Emergency as soon as order is restored in Egypt\". Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament \n\n the Egyptian parliament. Although women were granted political rights, women's activits were still fighting for equal social rights. During Abdel Nasser's reign, legislation was introduced that all civil society organizations were now under state control. This period is referred to as \"State-feminism\". In 1979, President Anwar Al Sadat issued a law allocating thirty parliamentary seats for women, which increased the amount of women in parliament from eight to thirty-five. This law was later recinded in 1986 due to a revison of electoral laws. During the Mubarak era, the amount of women's organizations increased from 10,000 to 30,000. In 2000, the National Council for Women was established. New laws were established giving women the right to divorce without her husbands \n\n of First Instance Courts of limited jurisdiction Family Court Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority ; Public Prosecution Administrative judiciary The Judiciary of Egypt consists of administrative and non-administrative courts, a Supreme Constitutional Court, penal courts, civil and commercial courts, personal status and family courts, national security courts, labour courts, military courts, and other specialized courts or circuits. Amendments to some articles of the 2014 Constitution passed by a public referendum followed on April 19-22, 2019, provide for the president to appoint the heads of the judicial bodies or authorities and to be head of the Supreme Council for the Judicial Authorities. Other members of that council include the head of \n\n The Parliament of Egypt is the bicameral legislature of the Arab Republic of Egypt. It is composed of an upper house (the Senate) and a lower house (the House of Representatives). The Parliament is located in Cairo, Egypt's capital. Under the country's 2014 constitution, as the legislative branch of the Egyptian state the Parliament enacted laws, approved the general policy of the State, the general plan for economic and social development and the general budget of the State, supervised the work of the government, and had the power to vote to impeach the president of the Republic, or replace the government and its prime minister by a vote of no-confidence. The parliament is made up of 596 seats, with 448 seats elected through the individual candidacy system, 120 elected through winner-take-all party lists (with quotas for youth, women, Christians, and workers) and 28 selected by the president. It is the fifth-largest legislative chamber in the world behind the National People's Congress and the largest parliamentary body in the Arab world.\n\n The judicial system (or judicial branch) of Egypt is an independent branch of the Egyptian government which includes both secular and religious courts. The Egyptian judicial system is based on European and primarily French legal concepts and methods, combined with Islamic (Shariah) law. The legal code is derived largely from the Napoleonic Code. Marriage and personal status are primarily based on the religious law of the individual concerned. Thus, there are three forms of family law in Egypt: Islamic, Christian, and secular (based on the French family laws). The judicial branch plays an important role in the political process in Egypt, as the branch is given the responsibility to monitor and run the country's parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nQuestion: what kind government does egypt have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Many believe them to be the greatest wave of social unrest the United States had experienced since the Civil War. Some of the biggest riots took place in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Kansas City.\n\n Years later, Indianapolis witnessed a historic moment in the Civil Rights Movement. On April 4, 1968, the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy delivered an impromptu speech on race reconciliation to a mostly African-American crowd in a poor inner-city Indianapolis neighborhood. Indianapolis was the only major American city spared the rioting that broke out across the country after the assassination.\n\n The assassinations triggered active unrest in communities that were already discontented. For example, the Memphis sanitation strike, which was already underway, took on a new level of urgency. It was to these striking workers that King delivered his final speech, and in Memphis that he was killed. Negotiations on April 16 brought an end to the strike and a promise of better wages. In Oakland, increasing friction between Black Panthers and the police led to the death of Bobby Hutton.\n\n Martin Luther King Jr. arrived in Memphis, Tennessee to support a strike by black sanitation workers in April 1968. On April 4, one day after delivering his \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech, King was assassinated on the balcony outside room 306 at the Lorraine Motel. At the time of the shooting, he was standing on the second floor balcony. King's last words were to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at a planned event. King said: \"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\" Soloman Jones was a volunteer who often drove King around town when he was in Memphis. After he heard the shots, he ran into the street. He related what he saw to the police that night, \"I could see a person in the thicket on the west side of Mulberry with his back to me, looked like he had a hood over his head.\" The next day, Memphis public work employees removed the bushes, destroying the crime scene.\n\n The conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a prominent leader of the civil rights movement, relate to different accounts of his assassination that took place on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. King was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, the day after giving his final speech \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\". Claims soon arose over suspect aspects of King's assassination and the controversial role of the alleged assassin, James Earl Ray. Although his guilty plea eliminated the possibility of a trial before a jury, within days, Ray had recanted and claimed his confession was forced. \n\nQuestion: what town was martin luther king assassinated in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Baudelaire, like Poe, had a traumatic childhood. After his father's death at a young age, he became traumatized by his mother's marriage to General Aupick. Baudelaire, similar to Modigliani, also engaged in a bohemian lifestyle, visiting prostitutes and experimenting with drugs and alcohol, which may have led to him contracting syphilis and gonorrhea. \n\nOn the other hand, Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, suffered from tuberculosis, which caused her to cough up blood while singing at the piano when she was only twenty years old. She tragically passed away from the disease at the age of twenty-five. Poe himself struggled with depression and alcoholism, and his health deteriorated over time. There are numerous theories surrounding the cause of his death, ranging from alcoholism, rabies, heart disease, and cholera to drug abuse, stroke, epilepsy, suicide, and even accidental suicide. It is unclear what exactly led to his demise, but he was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore and spent four days in a semiconscious state in Washington Medical College before passing away.\n\nOverall, both Baudelaire and Poe faced personal and health-related challenges, which ultimately influenced their creative lives and the works they produced.\n\nBoth were also drug addicts and alcoholics, both suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and both died in sad circumstances, poor and alone in hospital rooms.Both Poe and Baudelaire were, arguably, the pioneers of modernist aesthetics.He spent the last years of his life in a semi-catatonic state in nursing homes and eventually died on 31 August, 1867.Both Baudelaire and Poe suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, contracted tuberculosis, coughing blood while singing at the piano at the age of twenty. She died from the disease five years later and Poe's depression and alcoholism killed him two years after that. As in the death of Austen, there are a number of (conspiracy) theories as to the cause of Poe's death, including alcoholism, rabies, heart disease, cholera, drug-abuse, stroke, epilepsy, suicide, accidental suicide, delirium tremens, syphilis, tubercular meningitis and/or tuberculosis. Whatever it was that killed him, Poe was found delirious on 3 October, 1849 in the streets of Baltimore, wearing someone else's clothes. He spent four days semiconscious in Washington Medical College and died in the early morning of 7 October. Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) — who died four months before Munch's mother coughed her last — grew up and was educated in Lyon and, like Modigliani, was mother-fixated. After his father died when Baudelaire was six years old, he became traumatized by his mother's marriage to General Aupick. After he moved to Paris to study law, Baudelaire, like Modigliani later, became a dandified bohemian, visited prostitutes, experimented with drugs and alcohol and may have caught both syphilis and gonorrhoea. Illness troubled Baudelaire throughout his life, as did alcoholism, laudanum and opium abuse _and_ poverty — these factors, alongside the theory of him being bipolar, may have been the cause of a stroke he had in 1866 which left him aphasic. He spent the last years of his life in a semi-catatonic state in nursing homes and eventually died on 31 August, 1867. Both Poe and Baudelaire were, arguably, the pioneers of modernist aesthetics.

Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.

In 1918, he married Ruth Ellen Tullis. He received his B.S. in chemistry from Mount Union College. After completing his M.S., he served in the Chemical Warfare Service during World War I. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1922 from Ohio State University after starting work at Goodyear in 1919. In 1920 Sebrell isolated mercaptobenzothiazole, an important rubber vulcanization accelerator from various reactions. Although well known since the 1880s, Sebrell's insight was that it is generated in situ during the zinc-catalyzed vulcanization of rubber. He devised ways of producing mercaptothiazole on a commercial scale. \n\n to the Ross brothers for the production of casein glue. The first U.S. postage stamps used starch-based adhesives when issued in 1847. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of \n\n John Sipe's invention was unsuccessful. It was applied to solid rubber tires, rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939. The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process. On roads covered with snow, ice, mud, and water, sipes usually increase traction. A US patent to Goodyear also claimed sipes improve tire traction, and tend to close completely in \n\n Lorin Beryl Sebrell (19 November 1894 – 5 August 1984) was an American scientist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. noted for identifying mercaptobenzothiazole as a vulcanization accelerator. In 1942, Sebrell received the Charles Goodyear Medal.\n\nThe plant-derived latex crosslinked with sulfur that was introduced as a denture base material in 1853 was called vulcanized rubber. Vulcanization is a chemical process by which natural rubber or latex is treated with sulfur and heat to improve its strength, elasticity, and durability. This process was first developed by Charles Goodyear in the mid-19th century and revolutionized the use of rubber in various applications, including denture base materials. Vulcanized rubber offered significant advantages over other materials at the time, as it provided better comfort and durability for denture wearers.\n\nQuestion: when did charles goodyear invented rubber?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Marlon, 11 years-old, Lucia, 8 years-old, and Vivian, who will be 3 years old in March.\nThough we didn't know it at the time, Vivian was born with Angelman Syndrome. AS is a rare neuro-genetic disorder that makes some of the most simple things, like walking, holding a pencil, or feeding one's self into significant challenges. She has fine and gross motor challenges, and other developmental delays but by far her biggest challenge is communication. Many children with Angelman Syndrome never learn to speak and those that do, develop only a few words. Due to the fact that she struggles with fine motor skills, Vivian will not likely learn to sign. Basically, expression just doesn't come easy for her.\nToo often, when a child has speech and language impairments, many assume that they are cognitively impaired. With Vivian and so many others, this is just not the case. Vivian's receptive language and social awareness are quite developed actually. Vivian understands nearly everything her teachers, therapists, parents, and siblings say. This became clear to us even as an infant, when she would bring us objects that we were discussing, or look in the direction of something that was mentioned or when she engaged in play with her brother and sister - she would play along in a way that showed she understood.\nShe has shown such determination in figuring out how to get her message across even without speech. She's invented clever ways of letting us know what she wants and needs and even how she is feeling: Her facial expressions are just amazing and you can get a good idea of how she's feeling just by looking at her; She often pulls us where she wants to go; She grunts and uses various tones to make sure we know how she feels. With lots of specialized speech therapy with Heather and others, called \"prompt therapy\" she has even come up with a few sounds that approximate words. While we have seen important progress we were positive that there was more that we could do to give her a voice.\nIn June, when genetic testing showed that Vivian had Angelman Syndrome, our world expanded. We became part of a very special community that we never knew existed. Through this community we began to learn the ways in which families, therapists, and doctors were supporting kids with AS. It was through this community that we learned of a movement to get kids to use assistive technology to communicate. We started hearing about kids using \"talkers\" and we were compelled to learn more.\nWe learned that a \"talker\" was a device, usually a tablet like an iPad, that had a collection of symbols that when pressed, uttered words or phrases that matched the symbols. These are also referred to as AAC devices or Augmentative and Assistive Communication devices. My wife and I, both educators, were familiar with the idea of using symbols to communicate but had only seen very crude devices that did not allow for complex communication. When we started to see videos of children using talkers and especially upon meeting other children with Angelman Syndrome using their talkers we were filled with hope for Vivian. It was clear this AAC device might be Vivian's voice.\nWhile we still have a lot to learn, we have already gained so much from those that are using talkers with their children and from the research that exists around AAC devices. We initially thought that the AAC device might inhibit Vivian from speaking verbally but the research suggests the exact opposite. Using a talker will actually support her speech! We also fretted about the fact that she would be mocked for having to speak through a computer but her classmates in preschool and other children she interacts with have been fascinated to learn that the AAC device is her voice. We also worried that it might not be something that would be easily portable but other families with AS have found creative ways to harness the talker to their child so that it is always there (no one should ever leave their voice behind!). We were worried that she wouldn't have role models who communicated using devices but we have been inspired by Stephen Hawking, the theoretical physicist, and Micah Fowler, the main character who plays J.J. Dimeo in ABC's Speechless.\nWe believe strongly that AAC, lovingly called her talker, is going to be how Vivian finds her voice and that it is the world's job to figure out how to listen to all kinds of voices.\nDiscovery Times Square is an exhibition center presenting changing exhibits with topics from the Titanic to King Tut to China’s Terracotta Warriors.

This workshop focused on how to manage and treat those clients that we service with motor speech impairments. The primary focus was to determine a series of target phonemes for each individual child and then address motor learning, the practice of the required movements to produce the target sounds. To maximize the progress, Dr. Strand, stressed the importance of increasing opportunities for imitation of a few and short syllables during each session until mastery. This approach is dependent on a child’s ability to maintain attention and imitate oral movements with and without sound. It is a retraining of messages from one part of the brain to the next until it ends in the mouth so the articulators move as intended.

A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.\n\n  Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries beginning on 10 May 1940. German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly-defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks. The invaders forced the British Expeditionary Force to evacuate, and defeated several French divisions before they advanced to Paris, and down the strategic Atlantic coast. By June, the dire French military situation had French politics revolving around whether the Third Republic should negotiate an armistice, fight on from North Africa, or just surrender. Prime Minister Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but was outvoted and resigned. The government relocated several times ahead of advancing German troops, ending up in Bordeaux. President Albert Lebrun \n\n3 June — The Holocaust: Nazi leader Franz Rademacher proposes the Madagascar Plan according to which the Jewish population of Europe would be relocated to the island of Madagascar. ; 3 June — World War II: Paris is bombed by the Luftwaffe for the first time. ; 10 June — World War II: Norway surrenders to German forces. ; 14 June — World War II: Fall of Paris to German occupation. ; 15 June — World War II: Verdun falls to German forces. ; 17 June — A Luftwaffe Junkers 88 bomber sinks the British ship RMS Lancastria, which was evacuating troops from near Saint-Nazaire, France, killing some 5,800 men. (Wartime censorship prevents the story from becoming public.) ; 21 June — World War II: Vichy France and Germany sign an armistice at Compiegne, in the same wagon-lit railroad car used by Marshal Ferdinand Foch to accept the surrender of Germany in 1918. ; 23 June — World War II: German leader Adolf Hitler surveys newly defeated Paris in now occupied France. ; 30 June — World War II: German forces land in Guernsey, marking the start of the 5-year Occupation of the Channel Islands. \n\n The best, most modernised French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost their best heavy weaponry and their best armored formations. Between May and June, French forces were in general retreat and Germany threatened to occupy Paris. The French government was forced to relocate to Bordeaux on 10 June to avoid capture and declared Paris to be an open city the same day. The proposal of a Franco-British Union to shore up support for Paul Reynaud's government following the fall of Paris split support. With many pro-Armistice ministers in the cabinet, such as the Deputy Prime Minister Pétain, and the commander-in-chief of the French Army General Weygand, Reynaud resigned on 16 June. Petain became Prime Minister. While French resistance continued with the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle, the surrender of Metropolitan France ended any further attempts by the British to unite the two countries. By 22 June, the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) had losses of 27,000 dead, more than 111,000 wounded and 18,000 missing. French losses were 92,000 dead and more than 200,000 wounded. The British Expeditionary Force suffered 68,000 casualties, with around 10,000 killed.\n\n France was the largest military power to come under occupation as part of the Western Front in World War II. The Western Front was a military theatre of World War II encompassing Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. From 1940 to 1942, while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France. It was not until 1944 when France was liberated with the allied invasion restoring the French Government.\n\nQuestion: who did france surrender to in ww2?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sujud (prostration) is one of the main pillars of daily prayer in Islam. A single act of sujud is called a sajdah (plural sajdāt). Muslims do sujud several times in each prayer, depending on the number of raka'at of prayer: two sajadat are performed every raka'ah, and prayers vary in obligatory length between two and four raka'at (additional supererogatory raka'at are often performed as sunnah muakkadah, or emulation of the example of Muhammad as represented in the sahih hadith). A raka'ah \n\n The first pillar of Islam is the Shahada, the assertion of faith. There are two shahadas: \"There is no god but God\" and \"Muhammad is the messenger of God\". This set statement is normally recited in Arabic: lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh (لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله) \"There is no god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" It is essential to utter it to become a Muslim and to convert to Islam. The first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God. The Tawhid, which is the prayer that states \"no god but God\" is a major component of the Islamic faith, for it asserts the monotheistic aspect of Islam, promoting unity of God \n\n Sunni Islam requires its adherents to follow the Five Pillars of Islam. The first pillar, the shahadah or profession of faith is the affirmation \"There is no god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is his prophet.\" It is the first step in becoming a Muslim and a significant part of prayer. The second obligation is prayer at five specified times of the day. The third enjoins almsgiving. The fourth requires fasting during daylight hours in the month of Ramadan. The fifth requires a pilgrimage to Mecca for those able to perform it, to participate in the special rites that occur during the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. Most Sudanese Muslims are born to the faith and meet the first requirement. \n\n The Five Pillars of Islam (arkān al-Islām أركان الإسلام; also arkān ad-dīn أركان الدين \"pillars of the religion\") are fundamental practices in Islam, considered to be obligatory acts of worship for all Muslims. They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel. The Sunni and Shia agree on the basic details of the performance and practice of these acts, but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They are: Muslim creed, prayer, charity to the poor, fasting on the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca for those who are able.\n\n adhesion of the disciple (murid). The religion of Islam founded by Muhammad in 7th century Arabia incorporated ideas from Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity, specifically monotheism, Last Judgment, Heaven and Hell. However, it is closer to Judaism than Christianity, since it believes in the Unity of God, and God is seen as powerful rather than loving. The doctrine of Islam is based on five pillars: Shahada, faith; Salat, prayer; Zakat, alms-giving; Sawm, fasting; and Hajj, pilgrimage. Its beliefs are collected in the Quran, composed in its final form by 933. Starting from soon after its foundation, Islam has broken into several strands, including: \n\nQuestion: what are some of the traditions of islam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Murray also represented in Ireland at national level winning a 4 Nations title and three Gold medals for Ireland at the Multi-Nations tournaments. He also won the accolade of \"Young Boxer of the Year\" in 2003.\n\n Murray became frustrated after failing to qualify for the Athens Olympics in 2004 and so decided to switch to the pro ranks and relocate to London under manager Michael Helliet. Murray turned professional in March 2005, winning his first fight at the King's Hall, Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, in which he beat Welshman Jonathan Jones in a fourth-round knockout on a card that included Jim Rock, Neil Sinclair and Eamonn Magee. Murray, who fought out of St. Albans near London, England, won his first nine pro fights and three by knockout. Having returned to his native Country and County to box, Murray signed a promotional deal with Brian Peters Promotions and moved to John Breen's gym in Belfast. Murray was nominated in the 'Prospect of the Year' category for the 2008 irish-boxing.com National Boxing Awards Unfortunately, on 5 June 2011 he fought Gavin Rees of Wales and lost by Unanimous Decision.

In this period Namibian Standard Time was at UTC+02:00 (derived from South African Standard Time) in summer, and UTC+01:00 (equivalent to West Africa Time) in winter. Winter time began on the first Sunday in April at 03:00, and lasted until the first Sunday in September, 02:00 hours. In the Zambezi Region in the far north-east of Namibia clocks were not changed and remained on Central Africa Time all year round so that during winter time, Namibia spanned two time zones. Namibia was one of only a few countries in the world to implement winter time instead of daylight saving time. Ireland still adjusts clocks in Winter since 1971 while Czechoslovakia used the practice only in 1946 and never repeated it. In a regular daylight saving time \n\n half of the country. Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia. The climate is in general mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence. In spite of the high latitude, Sweden often has warm continental summers, being located in between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and vast Russia. The general climate and environment vary significantly from the south and north due to the vast latitudinal difference, and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested and includes a portion of the Scandinavian Mountains. Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats (Götar) and \n\n countries and regions use UTC±00:00 in winter months:  All the above countries except Iceland implement daylight saving time in summer (from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October each year), switching to Western European Summer Time (WEST, UTC+01:00), which is one hour ahead of WET. WEST is called British Summer Time in the UK and is legally defined as Irish Standard Time in Ireland. The nominal span of the UTC±00:00 time zone is 7.5°E to 7.5°W (0° ± 7.5°), but does not include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Gibraltar or Spain (except Canary Islands) which use Central European Time (CET) even though these are mostly or completely west of 7.5°E. Conversely, Iceland and eastern Greenland use UTC±00:00 although both are west of 7.5°W. In September 2013, a Spanish parliamentary committee recommended switching to UTC±00:00.\n\n Stockholm, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.  The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was 38 °C in Målilla in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was -52.6 °C in Vuoggatjålme on 2 February 1966. Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden.

Williams was assigned No. 85, indicating a return to tight end. During the 2015 season, Williams appeared in 15 regular season games (with nine starts) and caught three passes for 26 yards. Williams also appeared in both of the Patriots playoff games and started in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos on January 24, 2016. On June 8, 2016, Williams suffered a torn ACL during practice. On June 10, 2016, he was waived/injured by the Patriots and was reverted to injured reserve, missing the entire 2016 season. On February 5, 2017, Williams's Patriots appeared in Super Bowl LI. In the game, the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime. On March 9, 2017, Williams re-signed with the Patriots on a one-year deal. On May 12, 2017, Williams was released by the Patriots.\n\n The game was postponed to Monday night after Cam Newton tested positive for COVID-19. With Newton out, backup quarterback Brian Hoyer made the start for the Patriots. A low-scoring defensive affair in the first half saw the New England defense shut down Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes for much of the half, though the Patriots offense was likewise ineffective, with Hoyer taking a sack on the last play of the first half that prevented a potential game-tying field goal. Mahomes and the Chiefs offense came to life late in the third quarter, scoring two touchdowns on back-to-back drives as Hoyer was benched for Jarrett Stidham, who threw his first career touchdown but also two interceptions, including a pick-six to Tyrann Mathieu that all but sealed the game and dropped New England to 2–2.\n\n Flynn was signed by the New England Patriots on June 11, 2015.

The Patriots also had Tom Brady under contract, who was recovering from a knee-injury suffered in a 2008 game against the Chiefs. On July 15 the Chiefs signed Cassel to six-year contract extension worth a total of $63 million.\n\n After nearly three months in free agency, Newton signed a one-year deal with the New England Patriots on July 8, 2020. The contract included a base salary of $1.05 million, the minimum salary for a player with his amount of experience, and a maximum value of $7.5 million, including incentives and playing time bonuses.

Frederick is home to three dairies, a 1400-acre industrial park, and Frederick Regional Airport, which includes restored World War II hangars which house the World War II Airborne Demonstration Team. Frederick was visited in April 1905 by then U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt while he was on a wolf hunt.\n\n The Frederick County Council and the Frederick County Executive are, respectively, the elected representatives of the legislative and executive branches of the county government of Frederick County, Maryland, United States. Offices are located in Winchester Hall in the county seat, Frederick.\n\n As the county seat for Western Maryland, Frederick not only was an important market town but also the seat of justice. Although Montgomery County and Washington County were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county. Important lawyers who practiced in Frederick included John Hanson, Francis Scott Key and Roger B. Taney. Frederick was also known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting about a half dozen major churches. In 1793, All Saints Church hosted the first confirmation of an American citizen, by the newly consecrated Episcopal Bishop Thomas Claggett. That original colonial building was replaced \n\n Frederick is located in Frederick County in the northern part of the state of Maryland. The city has served as a major crossroads since colonial times. Today it is located at the junction of Interstate 70, Interstate 270, U.S. Route 340, U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 40 Alternate and U.S. Route 15 (which runs north–south).

Lee based the character on her own father, Amasa Coleman Lee, an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial. Book magazine's list of The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 names Finch as the seventh best fictional character of 20th-century literature. In 2003, the American Film Institute voted Atticus Finch, as portrayed in an Academy Award-winning performance by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, as the greatest hero of all American cinema. In the 2018 Broadway stage play adapted by Aaron Sorkin, Finch is portrayed by various actors including Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris, Greg Kinnear, Rhys Ifans, and Richard Thomas.\n\n Atticus Finch's willingness to support social outcasts and victims of prejudice is the eponymous inspiration for the name of the Atticus Circle, which is an organization composed of \"straight allies\" (that is, heterosexual people supportive of the LGBT rights movement). In 2016, the lawyer Joseph Madison Beck published the memoir My Father & Atticus Finch, in which he noted the numerous parallels between his father Foster Beck's defense of a black man accused of raping a white woman in the 1938 trial State of Alabama vs. Charles White, Alias, and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird. In a letter to the author, Harper Lee herself noted the \"obvious parallels\" between the cases (Lee was 12 at the time of the Charles White trial) and between Atticus Finch and Foster Beck, though she also stated that she could not recall the trial, and that To Kill a Mockingbird was a work of fiction. Former President Barack Obama referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character, and mentioned him during his farewell address to the nation on January 11, 2017.\n\n Georgia-born Augusta Jane Evans (1835-1909) moved to Mobile in 1849 and wrote many popular novels that incorporated aspects of her experience in Alabama. In 1960, Harper Lee, born in Monroeville, published perhaps the most celebrated novel set in Alabama, To Kill A Mockingbird. Winston Groom authored the novel Forrest Gump which was made into the hit movie of the same name.\n\n Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (September 24, 1825 – February 22, 1911) was an American abolitionist, suffragist, poet, teacher, public speaker, and writer. Beginning in 1845, she was one of the first African-American women to be published in the United States. Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. At 67, she published her widely praised novel Iola Leroy (1892), placing her among the first Black women to publish a novel. As a young woman in 1850, she taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the AME Church. In 1851, while living with the family of William Still, a clerk at the Pennsylvania Abolition Society who helped refugee slaves make their way along the Underground Railroad, Harper started to write \n\nQuestion: what highschool did harper lee go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls. Clinton performed well in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast, while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the 1976 election. Bush won a majority of the Southern states and also carried most of the Mountain States and the Plains states. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Several factors were important in Bush's defeat. The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss, \n\n The 2004 United States presidential election in Nebraska took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose five electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. However, this state is one of the two states of the U.S. that, starting in the 2004 election, instead of giving all of its electors to the winner based on its statewide results, just two of them vote based on the statewide results, and the others vote based on their individual congressional district results. Nebraska, a rural Great Plains state, is a Republican and conservative stronghold. Voters here gave an overwhelming victory to George W. Bush, who received more than twice the number of votes of his challenger, John F. Kerry. Bush who carried the state in 2000 increased his margin of victory, from 29% (2000) to 33% in 2004. Bush carried every congressional district, and every county except substantially Native American Thurston County which Kerry won by a narrow 2.43 percent margin. With 65.9% of the popular vote, Nebraska would prove to be Bush's fourth strongest state in the 2004 election after Utah, Wyoming and Idaho.\n\nJanuary 6 – The electoral votes are officially tallied before the 109th U.S. Congress in a joint session, with Vice President Dick Cheney presiding. During the session, however, Ohio Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones and California Senator Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, lodged a protest over alleged voting irregularities in Ohio on the Election Day. That measure was defeated by a vote of 267–31 in the House of Representatives and 74–1 in the Senate. Boxer cast the lone dissenting vote in the Senate. At 22:11 UTC, the Senate officially accepts the results of the U.S. Presidential Election, 2004, re-electing George W. Bush. ; January 20 – At high noon, George W. Bush is sworn into his second term as U.S. President. This occasion marks the 55th U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day, as set by the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n\n  Having served in various government positions, particularly the position of Director of the CIA, Bush sought the presidential nomination in the 1980 Republican primaries. He was defeated by Ronald Reagan, a conservative former governor from California. Seeking to balance the ticket with an ideological moderate, Reagan selected Bush as his running mate. Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Bush enjoyed warm relations with Reagan, and the vice president served as an important adviser and made numerous public appearances on behalf of the Reagan administration. Bush entered the 1988 \n\n M1 Abrams tank and a poor performance at the second presidential debate.  Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the Electoral College, and he took 53.4 percent of the national popular vote.

Ferguson was the son of John Ferguson and Catherine Matilda Pomeroy (Ferguson). His father was a Methodist minister and his mother a schoolteacher. Ferguson attended Albert College in Ontario, Canada and then Boston University, where he graduated in 1886. He was ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church and, in 1887, married Mary Elizabeth Wilson. Their son Douglas Ferguson was a sculptor and political activist. A daughter, Mary, served in the administration of the Peking Union Medical College in the 1930s.\n\n In 1982, Leo married a khasi women named Quinla. They have two sons. His wife and sons live in London, UK. As a people's representative, he lives in Kanaighat. But they travel back and forth. Ferguson celebrates Victory day of Bangladesh quietly at his tea garden.\n\n Ferguson was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where her British-born parents lived before moving to Britain as the Biafran war broke out. Her Scottish father Iain, a trainee pilot turned businessman worked for Dunlop. Iain and her mother Marjorie eloped to his native Scotland to marry despite family disapproval. Ferguson attended New Hall, a Catholic-run private girls school in Boreham, Essex. She later studied English literature at King's College, London. In her early teens, she began a correspondence with the poet Philip Larkin. In a teenage essay she said when she grew up, she wanted to be \"a commando and a librarian in the British House of Commons\". Ferguson's career began in newspapers in the United Kingdom, writing arts reviews for The Independent. Later she moved to Paris and worked as a researcher and production assistant on arts programs for French and British broadcasters. In 1992, Australian journalist and the ABC's London correspondent, Tony Jones, hired Ferguson to help him on a story about French politics. Ferguson and Jones married a year later. In 2017, the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters was conferred on Ferguson by the University of Sydney for excellence in journalism.\n\n In 1966, she married John Ferguson, a sociology lecturer at the University of Strathclyde, and together they adopted two children, a girl and a boy. John Ferguson died of cancer in 1989. She married Professor Gerald Collee, Emeritus Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Edinburgh in 1995. In her youth, Ferguson represented the University of Glasgow in athletics as a middle-distance runner. She was also on the Scottish women's basketball team. She enjoyed hill walking and mountaineering, and once visited the Himalayas with her first husband.

Hitler's death prevents him from rising to power as leader of Nazi Germany, effectively creating a new timeline. Without Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union (USSR) grows powerful under the rule of Joseph Stalin. The USSR seizes land from China, India and then invades Eastern Europe, to achieve Joseph Stalin's vision of a Soviet Union stretching across the entire Eurasian landmass. In response, the countries of Western Europe (including an already-rearmed Germany) form the Allied Nations and start a guerrilla war against the invading Soviet Army. Over the course of the game's story, the Allies and Soviets fight for control over the European mainland in an alternate World War II:\n\nThe deaths of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin within two decades after the Yalta Conference had significant historical and political ramifications. These three leaders played crucial roles in shaping post-World War II Europe during the conference. \n\nPresident Roosevelt's death just two months after the Yalta Conference had a major impact. His passing, caused by a hemorrhagic stroke, affected both the United States and international relations. It may have exacerbated post-WWII miscommunication between America and the Soviet Union, which may have contributed to the onset of the Cold War.\n\nPremier Stalin's death, eight years after the conference, also had significant political implications. As the leader of the Soviet Union, his passing marked a transition in power and potential shifts in Soviet foreign policy. This had implications not only for the Soviet Union but also for international relations and the balance of power during the post-war era.\n\nPrime Minister Churchill's death, twenty years after the conference, had historical significance as well. His illness forced him to resign as British Prime Minister, leading to a period of uncertainty and mistrust with the United States. Additionally, events such as Britain's mismanagement of the Egyptian Suez Crisis unfolded after Churchill's resignation, further impacting international relations.\n\nOverall, the deaths of these three leaders within two decades after the Yalta Conference had far-reaching historical and political consequences. They marked transitions in power, affected international relations, and potentially influenced the trajectory of the Cold War.\n\n Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, dies of a stroke. He is replaced by Nikita Khrushchev, who began a period of De-Stalinization.\n\n According to Richard Pipes, the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for World War II. Pipes argues that both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a \"genius\". According to Pipes, Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to assert Soviet power internationally. Before Hitler took power, Stalin allowed the testing and production of German weapons that were forbidden by the Versailles Treaty to occur on Soviet territory. Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitler's rule began in 1933. During the 1932 German elections, for instance, he forbade the German Communists from collaborating with the Social Democrats. These parties together gained more votes than Hitler and some have later surmised could have prevented him from becoming Chancellor.\n\n The history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953 covers the period of the Second World War and of victory against Nazi Germany while the USSR remained under the control of Joseph Stalin. Stalin sought to destroy his political rivals while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular a collectivization of agriculture and a development of heavy industry. Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization. The Communist Party were Stalin's major tools in molding the Soviet society. Stalin's methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to \n\nQuestion: who was the leader of soviet union during wwii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

GAIAS was established in 2002 at the capital town of the Galapagos province, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, on the island of San Cristobal, one of the largest of the Galapagos Islands. Its 4.5 hectare campus is the only one located on the historically significant Galapagos islands. GAIAS was founded on the principle that would become a first-rate institution for international students and researchers. The Galapagos Islands inspired Charles Darwin to define his evolutionary theory, which revolutionized human understanding in relation to the diversity of species, including humans. His ideas were presented in On the Origin of Species. The Galapagos Islands, are important for the scientific studies that have been developed over the centuries after his visit.\n\n Pinta Island (Spanish: Isla Pinta), also known as Abingdon Island, after the Earl of Abingdon, is an island located in the Galápagos Islands group, Ecuador. It has an area of 60 km2 and a maximum altitude of 777 m. Pinta was the original home to Lonesome George, perhaps the most famous tortoise in the Galápagos Islands. He was the last known representative of the subspecies Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii. Pinta Island is also home to swallow-tailed gulls, marine iguanas, Galapagos hawks, Galapagos fur seals and a number of other birds and mammals. The most northern major island in the Galápagos, at one time Isla Pinta had a thriving tortoise population. The island's vegetation was devastated over several decades by introduced feral goats, thus \n\n The government of Ecuador has designated 97% of the land area of the Galápagos Islands as the country's first national park. The remaining 3% is distributed between the inhabited areas of Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, Baltra, Floreana and Isabela.

In 1974, the Galápagos National Park Service had its first management plan and a team of officials in accordance with the organic structure issued in 1973, with a Superintendent, 2 conservation officers, 40 park rangers to comply with management objectives. On Santa Cruz is the Charles Darwin Research Station. In 1979 UNESCO declared the Galápagos Islands Natural Heritage for Humanity, making the \n\n The Galápagos hotspot is a volcanic hotspot in the East Pacific Ocean responsible for the creation of the Galápagos Islands as well as three major aseismic ridge systems, Carnegie, Cocos and Malpelo which are on two tectonic plates. The hotspot is located near the Equator on the Nazca Plate not far from the divergent plate boundary with the Cocos Plate. The tectonic setting of the hotspot is complicated by the Galapagos Triple Junction of the Nazca and Cocos plates with the Pacific Plate. The movement of the plates over the hotspot is determined not solely by the spreading along the ridge but also by the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the Cocos and Nazca Plates. The hotspot is believed to be over 20 million years old and in that time there has been interaction between the hotspot, both of these plates, and the divergent plate boundary, at the Galapagos Spreading Centre. Lavas from the hotspot do not exhibit the homogeneous nature of many hotspots; instead there is evidence of four major reservoirs feeding the hotspot. These mix to varying degrees at different locations on the archipelago and also within the Galapagos Spreading Centre.\n\n Service through the Superintendent of the Park responsible for performing permanent park conservation and guarding the islands.

According to Islamic belief, Allah is the most common word to represent God, and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. \"He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.\" \"He is unique (wāḥid) and inherently one (aḥad), all-merciful and omnipotent.\" No human eyes can see Allah till the Day Of Judgement. The Qur'an declares \"the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.\" Allah doesn't depend on anything. God is not a part of the Christian Trinity. \n\n and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edward Peters, \"The Qur’ān insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews . The Qur’an's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". Peters states that the Qur'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows Israelites.\n\n God), reported in the Litanias Lauretanas. Islam's most fundamental concept is tawhid meaning \"oneness\" or \"uniqueness\". God is described in the Quran as: \"He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\" Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is transcendent and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, and are not expected to visualize God. Henotheism is the belief and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities.\n\n1) Belief in God ; 2) Belief in the Angels ; 3) Belief in Divine Books ; 4) Belief in the Prophets ; 5) Belief in the Day of Judgment ; 6) Belief in God's predestination It is a fundamental constituent in a Muslim’s belief system to believe in the unseen. As illustrated in the Quran numerous times: \"... it [theQuran] is guidance for the righteous… for those who believe in the unseen\" (2:3-4). These verses are mentioned at the beginning of the Quran as core characteristics of a believer and consequently all six articles of faith are based on this notion of \"the unseen\". The six articles of faith in Islam are: As stated in a narration ascribed to Muhammad \"\"Iman is that you believe in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God].\"\"\n\n  Muslims believe that God (Allah) is beyond all comprehension and equal, and does not resemble any of his creations in any way.

It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.\" Rutherford's theory of neutrons was proved in 1932 by his associate James Chadwick, who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.\n\n megaelectronvolts, and Frisch observed this. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \"fission\". Hahn was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery. The discovery came after forty years of investigation into the nature and properties of radioactivity and radioactive substances. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and \n\n All consideration of nuclear electrons ended with James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an element's atomic number Z was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei.\n\n hence offering a target dense with protons. As in the Paris experiment, the radiation energetically scattered some of the protons. Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton. These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for this discovery. The year 1932 was later referred to as the \"annus mirabilis\" for nuclear physics in the Cavendish Laboratory, with discoveries of the neutron, artificial nuclear disintegration by the Cockcroft–Walton particle accelerator, and the positron.\n\n particles. The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon \n\nQuestion: what did the scientist chadwick discovered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Other titular variations include subtitles like \"A Satire\" and \"A Contemporary Satire\". Orwell suggested the title Union des républiques socialistes animales for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the Latin word for \"bear\", a symbol of Russia. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques. Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in \n\n George Orwell's Animal Farm is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a \"wider application\", according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance. Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably 1984, as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire. Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in Animal Farm and 1984. In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War. Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth \n\n out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination. In the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm: \"I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\" In 1944 the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London home. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact.\n\n George Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944 after his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which he described in Homage to Catalonia (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of Animal Farm, he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.\" This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. Homage to Catalonia sold poorly; after seeing Arthur Koestler's best-selling, Darkness at Noon, about the Moscow Trials, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism. Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the BBC. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had \n\n Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950) known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic.

Meade defeated Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 to 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war and has been called the war's turning point.

After forming a pact with the Soviet Union in 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a \"Phoney War\" in spring 1940, German forces swiftly conquered Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France, and forced the British army out of Western Europe. In 1941, Hitler's army invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. Racism, especially antisemitism, was a central feature of the Nazi regime. In Germany, but predominantly in the German-occupied areas, the systematic genocide program known as the Holocaust killed 17 million people, including 6 million Jews (representing \n\n making a communication.\" In March 1939, Hitler demanded the return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. German forces then invaded Poland, which started World War II. The invasion restored the Prussian territories lost in 1918. When Hitler invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Wilhelm declined Prime Minister Winston Churchill's offer to grant Wilhelm asylum in the United Kingdom. Wilhelm preferred to spend his remaining days at Huis Doorn. He died there on 4 June 1941. In admiration of Hitler's success during the opening months of the war, \n\n  Austrian-born Adolf Hitler had a lifelong romantic fascination with the Alps and by the 1930s established a home at Berghof, in the Obersalzberg region outside of Berchtesgaden. His first visit to the area was in 1923 and he maintained a strong tie there until the end of his life. At the end of World War II, the US Army occupied Obersalzberg, to prevent Hitler from retreating with the Wehrmacht into the mountains. By 1940 many of the Alpine countries were under the control of the Axis powers.

His solo debut album was described as being on the \"folkier side of pop\", incorporating elements of folk music as well as pop rock, soft rock, and country music. In an interview with Digital Spy, Horan cited Michael Bublé as one of his biggest influences because they had similar life histories, as he was discovered by his aunt and the same thing happened to Bublé, except he was discovered by his father. Horan has cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, calling her one of the greatest songwriters of her generation. Horan has also stated that he is a \"big, big swing fan\", citing his favourite artists as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Bublé. Horan has also stated that he is a \"Justin Bieber fan\" and has seen Bieber as a career model. Horan likes pop and rock music and is a fan of The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Jovi, The Script, Take That, and Westlife.\n\n The album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, with positive attention given to Bublé's vocals. Aaron Latham of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars and felt that the album \"mine[d] the rich history of pop music\" as he noted that Bublé applied \"his own technique to classic standards and incorporate[d] his Rat Pack sound into modern pop songs\". The songs \"Home\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Song for You\", and \"You and I\" were called the highlights of the album. Woodrow Wilkins from All About Jazz commended how It's Time was \"relevant to today's audience\" and noted that Bublé \"delivers [the songs] with the heart and passion that only a person who claims ownership of these titles can muster\". However, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian didn't appreciate the album's composition of jazz and pop covers, saying that \"Sinatra is turning in his grave\".

On the week ending December 10, 2011, Christmas rose to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart, becoming Bublé's third chart-topper following 2007's Call Me Irresponsible and 2009's Crazy Love, and spent five weeks at No. 1. As of December 2021 this is Buble's most successful album with more than 14 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. The album also won a Juno Award for Album of the Year, making it the first holiday album to win the award. The album was re-released on November 26, 2012, containing four additional tracks, including a new recording of \"The Christmas Song\". Bublé also released a reworked version of \"White Christmas\", this time featuring Shania Twain, as a single. This version premiered on Bublé's NBC television special, Home for the Holidays, on December 10, 2012.\n\n Dream is the second album by Canadian-Italian Jazz performer Michael Bublé.

As no one candidate won a majority of the electoral vote in the 1824 election, the election was decided by the House of Representatives in a contingent election that Adams won with the support of Clay. Like Monroe, Adams sought a geographically-balanced cabinet that would represent the various party factions, and he asked the members of the Monroe cabinet to remain in place for his own administration. Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the cabinet. Adams presided over a harmonious and productive cabinet. He met with the cabinet as a group on a weekly basis to discuss major issues of policy, and he gave individual cabinet members a great deal of discretion in carrying out their duties.\n\n John Adams Sr. (February 8, 1691 &ndash; May 25, 1761), also known as Deacon John, was a British-North American colonial farmer and minister. He was the father of the second U.S. president, John Adams Jr., and grandfather of the sixth president, John Quincy Adams. He was the son of Joseph Adams Jr. (1654–1737), the grandson of Joseph Adams Sr. (1626–1694), and the great-grandson of Henry Adams, who emigrated from Braintree, Essex, in England to Massachusetts Bay Colony in about 1638. He was also descended from John and Priscilla Alden. Adams worked as a farmer and cobbler (also called a cord-wainer or shoemaker) for most of his life. Adams' descendants include many prominent persons in American history, and his home is a National Park, the Adams National Historical Park. Not only was he the father and grandfather of presidents; he also was a first cousin, once removed, of Samuel Adams.\n\n years, now Quincy). He was a Congregationalist (that is, Puritan) deacon. The younger John Adams wrote of the religion his father was so passionate for, \"[they are] bearers of freedom, a cause that still had holy urgency.\" The future president was first known by reputation as the \"dutiful son of Deacon John\". As a selectman or town councilman, for 20 years, he supervised the poor house, schools, and roads. His wife forced him to resign as selectman after a \"family row\" over his taking in a destitute young female.

The rookie was facing withering insults from opposing players, and a petition by Dodger players protesting Robinson's presence had only recently been quashed by Durocher. Shotton's calm demeanor, however, provided the quiet leadership the Dodgers needed. They won the National League pennant by five games, and took the New York Yankees to seven games in the 1947 World Series. In Game 4, Shotton helped to thwart Bill Bevens' no-hit bid in the ninth inning, sending into the game two pinch \n\n Historic Dodgertown was added and announced on January 31, 2019. In the 1940s, Dodger management, led by Branch Rickey and O'Malley’s father and partner, Walter, took the bold step to break baseball’s color barrier. In 1947, the Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson, the first African-American since 1884 to sign a Major League Baseball contract. Robinson made his Dodgertown debut on March 31, 1948 and hit a home run in his first at-bat. The Dodgers signed five of the first six African-American players of the 20th century to professional baseball contracts. Dodgertown was unique because in addition to being teammates and training on the playing fields, all the \n\n 1946 to play baseball as a member of a white Class AAA International League Team in Daytona Beach, Florida, which was partnered with the Montreal Royals. Unfortunately, this was also during an era of racial segregation and racial tensions, especially in that part of the Southern United States which made up the former Confederacy. By the time Robinson took the field, the crowd of local white citizens in the stands ended up booing him off the field and he was not able to play. The then-Sanford police chief had actually threatened to cancel the game if Robinson took the field. On April 20, 1997, fifty years after Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league \n\n By the time America reached the beginning of the 20th century, nearly all black Americans had been shut out from playing any sort of baseball with white Americans. However, this didn't stop them from creating a league where they get to play themselves. Eventually, black Americans created their own league where persons of color could participate. In the early 1900s the Negro National League grew in popularity, despite the fact that white booking agents often had control over when and where the teams would be able to play or practice. The NNL came to an end due to the financial burdens of the Great Depression, but rearose soon after as the Negro American League. In 1947, Jackie Robinson was the first African American to be integrated into the previously all white world of baseball. Formerly having played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the NAL, a man named Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, sought Robinson as a perfect candidate to finally break the baseball color line. Robinson was still a target of many racist comments and slurs during his time in the majors. Despite this, Jackie Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\n\n Jackie Robinson Stadium is a college baseball park on the West Coast of the United States, located in Los Angeles, California. It is the home field of the UCLA Bruins of the Pac-12 Conference. Opened 41.48113076398402 years ago in 1981, it is the smallest ballpark in the conference, with a seating capacity of 1,820.

The first LP to be produced by the Yekos was a recording of selections from the musical The Baker's Wife by Stephen Schwartz, which was then touring prior to a much-anticipated Broadway opening. After hearing about the show, the Yekos had travelled to Boston to see it and, impressed by its score, subsequently telephoned Schwartz to discuss a possible recording. \n\n The opening number was \"Wanna Sing A Show Tune\". The special number was \"Forty Years of Broadway Show Music\", which included songs from musicals including Annie, Big River, Finian's Rainbow, Hello, Dolly!, Fiddler on the Roof, La Cage aux Folles, and Sweet Charity.

On December 1, a small notice in the local newspapers announced the show would be closing that night, prior to its official opening. The demand for tickets was immediate. Theatre buffs who revel in the calamitous as much as the classical were determined to see what was destined to go down in the Broadway annals as one of the all-time biggest flops.

The President can be seen wearing a black mourning band on his arm in photographs of him later signing the declaration of war against Japan. His mother's memory is commemorated with the Sara Delano Roosevelt Park in New York City's Lower East Side, which was dedicated during her lifetime, in 1934. She was buried next to her husband at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park.

Delano grew up in Newburgh, New York, and spent three years in Hong Kong. She gave birth to Franklin in 1882, and was a devoted mother to him for the remainder of her life, including home schooling and living close by in adulthood. She had a complex relationship with her daughter-in-law Eleanor, which has led to media portrayals of her as a domineering and fearsome mother-in-law, though these are at odds with other views.

The fall of Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit empire in late 15th century marked the end of dharmic civilization dominance in Indonesia. By the end of the 16th century, Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra. After that for 450 years, there is no significant Buddhist adherence and practice in Indonesia. Many of Buddhist sites, stupas, temples, and manuscripts are lost or forgotten, as the region has become more predominantly Muslim. During this era of decline, there were only small numbers of people practicing Buddhism, most of them are Chinese \n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country, with Islam being practiced by around 88% of the population, or over 200 million people. Despite this there are several areas of Indonesia where Muslims are the minority: ; 84% of the population of Bali practice a form of Hinduism called Balinese Hinduism, although Hindus only form 1.7% of Indonesia's overall population. ; Catholics form the majority of East Nusa Tenggara at 51%, although Catholics only form about 3% of Indonesia's overall population. ; Protestants form the majority in three Indonesian provinces: West Papua at 60%, Papua at 68%, and North Sulawesi at 64%. Overall though Protestants only form about 7% of Indonesia's population. ; Several neighborhoods and communities in major Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Medan and Yogyakarta are of predominantly of Chinese origin, although people of Chinese descent do not form more than 10% in any of these cities overall population and only form about 1-2% of Indonesia's overall population. \n\n About 86.91% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (10.05%), Christianity (2.35%), and Buddhism (0.68%) as for 2018. The general beliefs and practices of Agama Hindu Dharma mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of Pancasila. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, \n\n The Indonesian Constitution states \"every person shall be free to choose and to practice the religion of his/her choice\" and \"guarantees all persons the freedom of worship, each according to his/her own religion or belief\". It also states that \"the nation is based upon belief in one supreme God.\" The first tenet of the country's national ideology, Pancasila, similarly declares belief in one God. Government employees are required to swear allegiance to the nation and to the Pancasila ideology. While there are no official laws against atheism, a lack of religious belief is contrary to the first tenet of Pancasila, and atheists have been charged and prosecuted for blasphemy. Other laws and policies at the national and regional levels restrict certain types of religious activity, particularly among unrecognized religious groups and \"deviant\" sects of recognized religious groups. The government officially only recognises six religions, namely Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.\n\n Buddhism has a long history in Indonesia, and is recognized as one of six official religions in Indonesia, along with Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism and Confucianism. According to the 2018 national census roughly 0.8% of the total citizens of Indonesia were Buddhists, and numbered around more than 2 million. Most Buddhists are concentrated in Jakarta, Riau, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, North Sumatra, and West Kalimantan. These totals, however, are probably inflated, as practitioners of Taoism and Chinese folk religion, which are not considered official religions of Indonesia, likely declared themselves as Buddhists on the most recent census. Today, the majority of Buddhists in Indonesia are Chinese, however small numbers of native (such as Javanese and Sasak) also exist.\n\nQuestion: what are the religions practiced in indonesia?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1898 James was arrested, and stood trial in 1899 for the robbery of a Missouri Pacific train. Defended by noted progressive lawyer Frank P. Walsh, James was acquitted of the robbery charge.

Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election. Now Vice President-elect, Johnson was eager to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union \n\n for vice president. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, \"having Johnson, the southern War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country.\" Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State William Seward to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of fellow New Yorker and former senator Daniel S. Dickinson, a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New \n\n became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy. To sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution \n\n other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". \n\n Johnson, a War Democrat, had been elected Vice President in the 1864 presidential election as the running mate of Abraham Lincoln, a Republican. (The Republicans had chosen not to re-nominate Hannibal Hamlin for a second term as Vice President). Lincoln and Johnson ran together under the banner of the National Union Party, which brought together Republicans (with the exception of some hard-line abolitionist Radical Republicans who backed John C.

After the assassination of Lincoln, Johnson became President.

Over 100 locations are featured including from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight, numerous London locations, from Chatham to Broadstairs, to Folkestone, to Barnard Castle, and to St George's Hall in Liverpool. Many of the locations, such as the interior of 58 Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Dickens first read in public, the All the Year Round offices in Covent Garden where he lived and worked, and Gads Hill Place in Kent, are not open to the public and have rarely been filmed.\n\n the press's best-known editions were the collected works of William Congreve and William Wycherley and translations of Miguel de Cervantes and Dante. A number of illustrated editions were also produced. Nonesuch's editions are prized by collectors; particularly rare and well-designed editions can sell for more than £1000 ($1774 U.S.). In November 2005, Barnes & Noble issued reprints of the Nonesuch editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including Bleak House, Great Expectations and Hard Times, the Christmas Books, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby. A second set of reissues was released in November 2008, including A Tale of Two Cities, Martin Chuzzlewit and Little Dorrit. Nonesuch editions of Dickens' novels have also been republished by Duckworth in the UK.\n\n Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today. Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a blacking factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he was returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Despite \n\n Dickens began by writing seventeen episodes, which were printed in All the Year Round between 28 January and 13 October 1860 and these were published in a single edition in 1861. He sporadically produced eleven more articles between 1863–65 and an expanded edition of the work was printed in 1866. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875. The work is not markedly different from articles he contributed to Household Words, an earlier journal, or the contents of Sketches by Boz written near the start of his literary career. They display his wit, humour and occasionally his righteous \n\n Museums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Overthrowing the pre-existing Provisional Government, the Bolsheviks established a new administration, the first Council of People's Commissars (see article \"Lenin's First and Second Government\"), with Lenin appointed as its governing chairman. Ruling by decree, Lenin’s Sovnarkom introduced widespread reforms confiscating land for redistribution among the permitting non-Russian nations to declare themselves independent, improving labour rights, and increasing access to education. The Lenin party continued with the previously scheduled November 1917 election, but when it produced a Constituent Assembly dominated by the rival Socialist Revolutionary Party the Bolsheviks lambasted it as counter-revolutionary and shut it down. The Bolshevik government banned \n\n With the October Revolution in 1917 the Bolsheviks took power from the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks established the first socialist state based on the ideas of soviet democracy and Leninism. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in World War I and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the White Movement and several independence movements in the Russian Civil War. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of Marxism–Leninism. In 1919, the nascent Soviet Government established the Communist Academy and the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the Russian Communist Party. With Lenin's death in 1924, there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the form of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition respectively. These struggles were based on both sides different interpretations of Marxist and Leninist theory based on the situation of the Soviet Union at the time.\n\n soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks, who were led by Vladimir Lenin, and the Mensheviks, who were led by Julius Martov. However, many Marxist argue that unlike in capitalism the Soviet elites did not own the means of production, or generated surplus value for their personal wealth like in capitalism as the generated profit from the economy was equally distributed into Soviet society. Even some Trotskyist like Ernest Mandel criticized the concept of a new ruling class as an oxymoron, saying: \"The hypothesis of the bureaucracy’s being a new ruling class leads to the conclusion that, for the first time in history, we are confronted with a 'ruling class' which does not exist as a class before it actually rules.\"\n\n In 1943, during the Second World War, three great powers come together at the Tehran Conference to decide the state of the Allied war effort. One of the three powers that has emerged as a key player is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, led by Joseph Stalin. The effectiveness of their Allied cooperation depends heavily on the United States and the United Kingdom having an understanding of the nature and history of their other partner, the Soviet Union. In First World War, after the October Revolution of November 1917, Communist Party leader Vladimir Lenin overthrew the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II. The Soviet Union was subsequently officially established in December 1922. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin emerged as the new leader. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, with great sacrifices made by the working class and peasants, the Soviet \n\n Following the establishment of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin was left incapacitated by a stroke and a Troika made up of Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin and Grigory Zinoviev assumed control of the state. The Troika government was briefly opposed by the council communists of the Workers' Group, but they were swiftly expelled from the Communist Party and eventually repressed entirely. When Lenin died of his ailments, a power struggle broke out between the Communist Party's various factions: the right-wing led by Nikolai Bukharin, the centre led by the Troika and the left-wing led by Leon Trotsky. When Stalin allied himself with the right-wing policy of socialism in one country, the Troika \n\nQuestion: who was the first dictator of the soviet union?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Modern peso and dollar currencies have a common origin in the 16th–19th century Spanish dollar, most continuing to use its sign, \"$\". The current ISO 4217 code for the peso is MXN; prior to the 1993 revaluation, the code MXP was used. The peso is subdivided into 100 centavos, represented by \"¢\". The Mexican peso is the 15th most traded currency in the world, the third most traded currency from the Americas (after the United States dollar and Canadian dollar), and the most traded currency from Latin America. , the peso's exchange rate was $23.51 per euro and $20.06 per U.S. dollar.\n\n This is a list of Puerto Rico locations by per capita income. In 2017, Puerto Rico had a per capita income of $12,081 — lower than any state and one of the lowest in the United States. In 2017, Puerto Rico had a median household income of $19,775 — the lowest of any state or territory in the United States. Puerto Rico is the only U.S. territory whose data is recorded annually in American Community Survey estimates (as if it were a state) — the other U.S. territories have their data recorded only once every 10 years.\n\n main export is copper to China and India. The currency strength has resulted in over-high wages, and high inflation. The East Caribbean dollar is the most used currency by the number of countries in the Caribbean utilizing it. The East Caribbean dollar is pegged to the United States dollar, and has been for over 35 years since 1976, having previously been pegged to the pound sterling. In 1965, the East Caribbean Currency Authority was established (coming after the British Caribbean Currency Board), to distribute currency, but The Bahamas withdrew from the organisation to create its own bank. The East Caribbean dollar is used in all \n\n Spanish is the first official language of Puerto Rico, while English is the second official language. Spanish has been an official language in Puerto Rico since it was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. English was introduced as an official language when the United States acquired Puerto Rico as a territory after the Spanish–American War and the Treaty of Paris in 1898. Spanish is the most widely spoken and written language, and the vast majority of Puerto Ricans do not use English regularly other than some borrowed English words in their ordinary Spanish speech. Various surveys have found that the majority of Puerto Ricans are not fluent in English. Out of those age five and older, 76.6% of Puerto Rico did not speak English \"very well,\" and 94.5% spoke a language other than English at home.\n\n Lower levels of currency cooperation have been practiced in the Americas before. Some nations such as Argentina and Brazil have at times tied their currency to the U.S. dollar. Some of them, such as Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, and the Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean, still do. The U.S. dollar is officially accepted alongside local currencies in El Salvador (since 2001), Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras, Panama, Bermuda and Barbados, and in practice two of these countries (El Salvador and Panama) are fully dollarized. In 2000, Ecuador officially adopted the U.S. dollar as its sole currency. In a few areas of Canada, the U.S. dollar can be accepted as currency alongside the Canadian Dollar, particularly in areas near border crossings. An example of this effect is Niagara Falls, Ontario, with large numbers of U.S. tourists (businesses still may not accept U.S. currency depending on their policy).

The borough is in the Allegheny Plateau region of the United States, and is situated 5 mi south of the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River. Due to its position between the Great Lakes and the windward side of the Allegheny Mountains, Brentwood, along with the rest of the region, receives plentiful precipitation which supports lush vegetation. Also, because it is on the windward side of the mountains, it is often cloudy, having 203 cloudy days per year. The winter is particularly cloudy, with only 28 percent sunshine in December and 23 cloudy days. In the winter, when a northwest flow establishes itself over the Great Lakes, the wind blows from Lake Erie across eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. That wind carries moist air from the lake, producing clouds and heavy snow squalls.\n\n The Little Harpeth River is a 16.3 mi tributary of the Harpeth River in Tennessee, just south of Nashville.

After about a month long march, the army finally arrived in Nashville. His actions earned him respect and praise from the people of Tennessee. Jackson faced financial ruin, until his former aide-de-camp Thomas Benton persuaded Armstrong to order the army to pay the expenses Jackson had incurred. On June 14, Jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer William Carroll against Jesse Benton, the brother of Thomas. On September 3, Jackson and his top cavalry officer, Brigadier General John Coffee, were involved in a street brawl with the Benton brothers. Jackson was severely wounded by Jesse with a \n\n advantage of more than 2 to 1, engaged them on March 27 at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. A subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the allied Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.  The campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as McQueen fled to East Florida. On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the United States Army, and 10 days later became a major general, in command of the Seventh Military Division. Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's \n\n  The Second Battle of Bull Run or Battle of Second Manassas was fought August 29–30, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia Campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas) fought on July 21, 1861 on the same ground. Following a wide-ranging flanking march, Confederate Maj. Gen.

Withdrawing a few \n\n After winning the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia lost Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson to pneumonia following a friendly fire accident. His death was a blow to the morale of the Confederate army, as he was one of its most popular and successful commanders. Two months later, Robert E. Lee had no general with Jackson's audacity available at the Battle of Gettysburg. Many historians argue that Jackson might have succeeded in seizing key battlefield positions (such as Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill at the end of day one) that his replacements were unable or unwilling to take. Lee himself shared this belief and is said to have told his subordinate generals on different occasions that they should have acted like Jackson would have.\n\n stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".

The Akiek language is said to be a moribund language: only a few elderly speakers are left. The Akiek in Tanzania now speak Maasai, and those in Kenya speak kalenjin. The Akiek are a subgroup of the Ogiek or Okiek, who intermarried and lost contact with the core of the Ogiek. The terms Akiek and Okiek are sometimes used interchangeably and confusingly. The correct name of the original people is Ogiek.\n\n The Samburu are a Nilotic people of north-central Kenya. Samburu are semi-nomadic pastoralists who herd mainly cattle but also keep sheep, goats and camels. The name they use for themselves is Lokop or Loikop, a term which may have a variety of meanings which Samburu themselves do not agree on. Many assert that it refers to them as \"owners of the land\" (\"lo\" refers to ownership, \"nkop\" is land) though others present a very different interpretation of the term. Samburu speak the Samburu dialect of the Maa language, which is a Nilotic language. The Maa language is also spoken by other 22 sub tribes of the Maa community otherwise known as the Maasai. Many Western anthropologists tried to carve out and create the Samburu tribe as a community of its own, unaffiliated to its parent Maasai community, a narrative that seems to have sunk into the minds of many Samburu people today. There are many game parks in the area, one of the most well known is Samburu National Reserve. The Samburu sub tribe is the third largest in the Maa community of Kenya and Tanzania, after the Kisonko (Isikirari) of Tanzania and Purko of Kenya and Tanzania.\n\n way of life is embedded in their language. Specifically, the economic systems of trade that the Maasai rely on in order to maintain their nomadic way of life, relies on the survival of the Maasai language, even in its minority status. With language endangerment, Maasai peoples would continue to be threatened and its cultural integrity threatened. The minority status that the language currently faces has already threatened traditional Maasai practices. Fewer and fewer groups of Maasai continue to be nomadic in the region, choosing to settle instead in close knit communities to keep their language and other aspects of their culture alive.\n\n The Maasai people make up the majority of Namuncha's population followed by the Kikuyu and Turkana peoples. The predominant languages are Maa (the Maasai language), Kikuyu, and Swahili. Agriculture and pastoralism are the main sources of subsistence. There is an open-pit mine located near the river that employs a number of residents. Joseph Mutete ole Kishau is Namuncha's elected community chairman.\n\n  Maasai (Masai) or Maa (autonym: ɔl Maa) is an Eastern Nilotic language spoken in Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania by the Maasai people, numbering about 800,000. It is closely related to the other Maa varieties: Samburu (or Sampur), the language of the Samburu people of central Kenya, Chamus, spoken south and southeast of Lake Baringo (sometimes regarded as a dialect of Samburu); and Parakuyu of Tanzania.

He acknowledged in his memoirs, Up Late With Joe Franklin, (which was written with R. J. Marx), that his press materials had long said, purposely, that he had been born in 1928, but he planned to come clean about his real birth date. As a teenager, Franklin \"followed around\" Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor, the latter of whom eventually began buying jokes from the young Franklin and whose Carnegie Hall show he later produced. At age 18, Franklin was drafted into the United States Army, serving in World War II.\n\n Born Sarah Franklin and known as \"Sally\" throughout her life, she was the only surviving child of her parents, Deborah Read and Benjamin Franklin. Their son Francis Franklin died of smallpox at age four. Also in their household was her older half-brother William Franklin, her father's illegitimate son whom her parents raised from infancy. When Sarah was born in 1743, Benjamin Franklin was thirty-seven and intently focused on furthering his career and wealth. Growing up, Sarah did not have a very close relationship with her father. Franklin's reserved nature towards his daughter may have been partially due to the previous loss of \n\n Franklin was born on Milk Street, in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 17, 1706, and baptized at Old South Meeting House. As a child growing up along the Charles River, Franklin recalled that he was \"generally the leader among the boys.\" Franklin's father wanted him to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although \"his parents talked of the church as a career\" for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded The New-England Courant, which was one of the first American newspapers. \n\n agreed to. He then asked for a further loan four days later and, on 3 March begged Franklin for \"a small allowance by week or month, in order to assist my slender Circumstances\". A further request for money was made on 12 May, shortly before the \"Melmoths\" returned to England, to which Franklin replied that he found the requests for money \"a greater inconvenience to myself than you perhaps imagined\", but agreeing to the further loan, relying \"on your Honour and Punctuality for the speedy Repayment\". On 22 June 1778 Pratt wrote to Franklin from London regretting that he and Melmoth were unable to repay the money, whereupon the friendship with Franklin appears to have abruptly ended. By 1781 Pratt and Melmoth had separated, and Melmoth, retaining her 'married' surname, continued her acting career in Ireland. In 1793 she emigrated to the United States.\n\n Bache loved music and reading, and was considered a skilled harpsichordist. Sarah Franklin Bache's relationship with her father was strained throughout her adulthood. After her marriage to Richard Bache without her father's knowledge, Benjamin Franklin had a detached attitude towards his only daughter. Evidence exists in The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin which \"constructs an image of a strong, powerful, and savvy patriarch, written for a male audience.\" The autobiography hardly mentions Franklin's wife, Deborah Read, and fails to mention his daughter Sally at all. When the American Revolutionary War ended, Benjamin returned to Philadelphia and lived with his daughter and her family for the remaining years of his life.

Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the \"great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the cinquecento\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian. His most famous works are elaborate narrative cycles, executed in a dramatic and colorful style, full of majestic architectural settings and glittering pageantry. His large paintings of biblical feasts, crowded with figures, painted for the refectories of \n\n are more Gothic than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the three Meisterstiche (master prints) Knight, Death and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514), and Melencolia I (1514). His watercolours mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his woodcuts revolutionised the potential of that medium. Dürer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions.\n\n When he received the commission for The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci had never worked on a piece of this great a size, fifteen feet high by almost twenty-nine feet wide. He also had very limited experience working in the technique known as fresco, mixing pigment into wet plaster to create a permanent bond. Traditionally, fresco painters applied many successive layers of plaster before and during the painting process. This method requires fresco painters to work quickly and with a pre-set plan. However, this is not how Leonardo worked, and for this reason, he chose a new technique of putting a mixture of oil and tempera paints onto a dry wall. According to Ross King, “In essence, [Leonardo] took tempera paints and mixed emulsifying oils into \n\n Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa has become one of the most recognizable paintings in the world since it was created in 1503. In 1963, the painting made a rare voyage across the Atlantic from Paris for exhibitions at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Andy Warhol, the leading artist of the pop art movement, was an enthusiast of pop culture. In response to the US tour of the Mona Lisa, Warhol created his own multicolored depiction, Colored Mona Lisa. It is an early example of his prowess of inextricably linking high art and consumer culture. Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler came up with the idea for the painting and the work's source image was taken from a brochure published by the museum. In May 2015, Warhol's painting sold for $56.2 million at Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale, surpassing its high estimate of $35 million.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings hold great significance in his exploration of Nature and contribute to his overall legacy as an artist and scientist. These drawings serve as a testament to his deep interest in anatomy and medicine. Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings.\n\nHis anatomical drawings are a remarkable display of his observational skills, meticulous attention to detail, and commitment to scientific accuracy. They demonstrate his ability to dissect and examine cadavers, as well as his keen eye for capturing anatomical structures, proportions, and relationships. These drawings were not merely artistic representations but rather scientific records of his discoveries, reflecting his curiosity to uncover the secrets of the human body.\n\nDa Vinci's anatomical studies were groundbreaking during his time and greatly advanced the understanding of human anatomy. He made several important discoveries, including the first accurate depiction of the human spine and the detailed representation of individual organs and systems. His anatomical drawings laid the foundation for later advancements in medical knowledge and have provided invaluable insights for anatomists, physicians, and scientists throughout history.\n\nFurthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. His understanding of human anatomy enabled him to create more lifelike figures, capturing their grace, movement, and proportions with unparalleled accuracy. The anatomical knowledge he gained improved his ability to portray the human form, leading to the creation of masterpieces such as \"The Last Supper\" and the iconic \"Vitruvian Man.\"\n\nIn addition to his artistic and scientific contributions, da Vinci's anatomical drawings also highlight his multidisciplinary approach as a true \"uomo universale\" or \"universal man.\" These drawings demonstrate his ability to bridge the gap between art and science, showing that the study of nature and the human body were intricately interconnected. Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist.\n\nBy virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form.\n\nQuestion: what works of art did leonardo da vinci produce?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

First attempts at the formation of Greater Vienna already date back to the times of the Habsburg monarchy. After the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938, Vienna was expanded to \"the largest city of the Reich by area\". Nowadays the term \"Greater Vienna\" is mainly used to distinguish the larger region around Vienna, which was enlarged during the Nazi era, from the present-day city. In 1954 during the Allied occupation of Austria, the extensions were mostly reverted to its pre-annexation state.\n\n The largest city within the Alps is the city of Grenoble in France. Other larger and important cities within the Alps with over 100,000 inhabitants are in Tyrol with Bolzano (Italy), Trento (Italy) and Innsbruck (Austria). Larger cities outside the Alps are Milan, Verona, Turin (Italy), Munich (Germany), Graz, Vienna, Salzburg (Austria), Ljubljana, Maribor, Kranj (Slovenia), Zurich, Geneva (Switzerland), Nice and Lyon (France). Cities with over 100,000 inhabitants in the Alps are:\n\n Catholicism is the largest religion in Austria, representing 57.9% of the total population in 2017. The Catholic Church's governing body in Austria is the Austrian Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of the two archbishops (Wien, Salzburg), the bishops and the abbot of territorial abbey of Wettingen-Mehrerau. Nevertheless, each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Pope. The current president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who belongs to the Central European noble family of Schönborn. Although Austria has no primate, the archbishop of Salzburg is titled Primus Germaniae (Primate of Germany). The organization Call to Disobedience (Aufruf zum Ungehorsam) is an Austrian movement mainly composed of dissident Catholic priests which started in 2006. The movement claims the support of the majority of Austrian Catholic priests and favours ordination of women, married and non-celibate priesthood, allowing Holy Communion to remarried divorcees and non-Catholics in contrast to teachings of the Catholic Magisterium.\n\n The city of Vienna, Austria is home to a long-established Czech population. During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 1800s and early 1990s, Czechs were the largest non-German speaking population in Vienna. After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the independence of Czechoslovakia, many of the Viennese Czechs returned to their homeland. Today, Vienna is home to a small Czech population that has grown in numbers since the Czech Republic's admission to the European Union in 2004.\n\nVolksgarten, Vienna.

The two were married the following year. Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina in June 1946; during the next six years, Eva Perón became powerful within the pro-Peronist trade unions, primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights. She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party. In 1951, Eva Perón announced her candidacy for the Peronist nomination for the office of Vice President of Argentina, receiving great support from the Peronist political base, low-income and working-class Argentines who were referred to as descamisados or \"shirtless ones\". \n\n María Eva Duarte de Perón (7 May 1919 – 26 July 1952), better known as just Eva Perón or by the nickname Evita, was an Argentine actress, politician, activist, and philanthropist who served as First Lady of Argentina from June 1946 until her death in July 1952, as the wife of Argentine President, Juan Domingo Perón (1895–1974). She was born in poverty in the rural village of Los Toldos, in the Pampas, as the youngest of five children. In 1934, at the age of 15, she moved to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires to pursue a career as a stage, radio, and film actress. She met Colonel Juan Perón on 22 January 1944 during a charity event at the Luna Park Stadium to benefit \n\n from the nation's military and bourgeoisie, coupled with her declining health, ultimately forced her to withdraw her candidacy. In 1952, shortly before her death from cancer at 33, Eva Perón was given the title of \"Spiritual Leader of the Nation\" by the Argentine Congress. She was given a state funeral upon her death, a prerogative generally reserved for heads of state. Eva Perón has become a part of international popular culture, most famously as the subject of the musical Evita (1976). Cristina Álvarez Rodríguez claims that Evita has never left the collective consciousness of Argentines. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the first woman elected President of Argentina, claims that women of her generation owe a debt to Eva for \"her example of passion and combativeness\".\n\n Despite the hysterectomy, Péron's cervical cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly. She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy – a novel treatment at that time. She became emaciated, weighing only 36 kg by June 1952. Péron died at 8:25 p.m. on Saturday, 26 July 1952. Radio broadcasts throughout the country were interrupted with the announcement that \"the Press Secretary's Office of the Presidency of the Nation fulfills its very sad duty to inform the people of the Republic that at 20:25 hours, Mrs. Eva Perón, Spiritual Leader of the Nation, died.\"\n\n On 9 January 1950, Evita fainted in public and underwent surgery three days later. Although it was reported that she had undergone an appendectomy, she was, in fact, diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer. Fainting episodes continued through 1951 (including the evening after \"Cabildo abierto\"), with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding. By 1951, it had become evident that her health was rapidly deteriorating. Although her diagnosis was withheld from her by Juan, he knew she was not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical. Only a few months after \"the Renunciation\", Evita secretly underwent a radical hysterectomy, performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack, of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in an attempt to eradicate her advanced cervical cancer. In 2011, a Yale neurosurgeon, Daniel E. Nijensohn, studied Evita's skull x-rays and photographic evidence and said that Perón may have been given a prefrontal lobotomy in the last months of her life, \"...to relieve the pain, agitation and anxiety she suffered in the final months of her illness.\"\n\nQuestion: what type of cancer did eva peron have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–483 BCE in Lumbini. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. The date for the celebration of Buddha's birthday varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment (on the day of the full moon) and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays.\n\n Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam. In the earliest form of Buddhist art, the Buddha was not represented in human form but instead was represented using signs and symbols such as footprints or an empty throne. From the fifth century B.C. to the first century B.C., Indian \n\n Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE). He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay. His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction \n\n Anomadassi Buddha was born in Chandawatinagara. His parents were King Yasavā and Queen Yasodharā. He was married to Queen Sirimādevi and reigned the country for 10,000 years. His son was Upavāna. As soon as his son was born, he decided to leave the palace to practise asceticism. Thirty million servants followed him to become fellow ascetics. He practised for ten months. After practising for ten months, he left his servant ascetics and went to the Terminalia elliptica tree. He began to practise peacefully under the tree and gained enlightenment the next morning.\n\n Buddhism in Nepal started spreading since the reign of Ashoka through Indian and Tibetan missionaries. The Kiratas were the first people in Nepal who embraced Gautama Buddha’s teachings, followed by the Licchavis and Newar people. Buddha was born in Lumbini in the Shakya Kingdom. Lumbini is considered to lie in present-day Rupandehi District, Lumbini zone of Nepal. Buddhism is the second-largest religion in Nepal. According to 2001 census, 10.74% of Nepal's population practiced Buddhism, consisting mainly of Tibeto-Burman-speaking ethnicities, the Newar. However, in the 2011 census, Buddhists made up just 9% of the country's population. It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince Siddhartha, the birth name of the Buddha, was born, it is usually placed at around 563 BCE. In Nepal's hill and mountain regions Hinduism has absorbed Buddhist tenets to such an extent that in many cases they have shared deities as well as temples. For instance, the Muktinath Temple is sacred and a common house of worship for both Hindus and Buddhists.\n\nQuestion: what country did buddha come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the years which followed he served as an elder adviser to the group of Russian composers known as \"The Five\". He also warmed to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky after hearing the composer play the finale of his Little Russian Symphony at a Christmas 1872 gathering at Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's home. Shortly after this gathering, Stasov prompted Tchaikovsky to write a piece based on Shakespeare's The Tempest. He also drafted a program, initially for Hector Berlioz, that Tchaikovsky eventually used for his Manfred Symphony. In between those two works, Stasov suggested an opera based on Alfred de Vigny's historical romance Cinq-Mars. Tchaikovsky was then intent on writing Eugene Onegin, and Charles Gounod had already written an opera based on Cinq-Mars.\n\n embracing their Russian national identity and the RMS being musically more conservative. However the RMS founded Russia's first Conservatories in St Petersburg and in Moscow: the former trained the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–93), best known for ballets like Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker. He remains Russia's best-known composer outside Russia. Easily the most famous successor in his style is Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943), who studied at the Moscow Conservatory (where Tchaikovsky himself taught). The late 19th and early 20th century saw the third wave of Russian classics: Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915), Sergei Prokofiev (1891–1953) and Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975). They \n\n Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2 in C minor, Op. 17 was composed in 1872. One of Tchaikovsky's joyful compositions, it was successful right from its premiere and also won the favor of the group of nationalistic Russian composers known as \"The Five\", led by Mily Balakirev. Because Tchaikovsky used three Ukrainian folk songs to great effect in this work, it was nicknamed the \"Little Russian\" (Малороссийская, Malorossiyskaya) by Nikolay Kashkin, a friend of the composer as well as a well-known musical critic of Moscow. Ukraine was at that time frequently called \"Little Russia\". Despite its initial success, Tchaikovsky was not satisfied with the symphony. He revised the work extensively in 1879–80, substantially rewriting the opening movement and shortening the finale. This revision is the version of the symphony usually performed today, although there have also been supporters of the original version. Among those advocates was the composer's friend and former student, Sergei Taneyev, who was himself a noted composer and pedagogue.\n\n Tchaikovsky wrote much of the Little Russian Symphony during his summer holiday at Kamianka (Kamenka) in Ukraine with his sister Aleksandra's family, the Davydovs. The Davydov estate had become the composer's favorite refuge. Alexandra had, in fact, encouraged the composer to make Kamenka his second home. His affection for the estate bore fruit in his using local songs in the symphony he was writing. He even once wrote, in jest, that true credit for the Little Russian's finale should have gone \"to the real composer of the said work&mdash;Peter Gerasimovich.\" Gerasimovich, the elderly butler in the Davydov household, sang the folk-song \"The Crane\" to Tchaikovsky while the composer was working on the symphony. One of Tchaikovsky's favorite anecdotes resulted from his nearly losing the sketches for the Little Russian on the way back to Moscow. To persuade a recalcitrant \n\n Tchaikovsky may not be a nationalist composer in the manner of the Russian composers known as \"The Five\" or \"The Mighty Handful\", but he retained a love for Russian folk song and Orthodox chant his entire life. His liturgical music includes a setting of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and an All-Night Vigil which draw upon traditional chant. His affinity for folk song led him in 1868–69 to publish Fifty Russian Folksongs arranged for piano duet. All but one he transcribed himself came from the collections of Villebois and Balakirev.\n\nQuestion: what did peter tchaikovsky do?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In fact, in cities such as Hanover and Berlin, the dialect started disappearing with the exception of a small minority of Low German speakers that only make up 5 million people. Austria also experienced the same situation, where less than 1,500,000 speakers of the dialect still remain. In most of Germany (except southern German Bundesländer Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, where Bavarian and Swabish are commonly spoken), people generally use Standard German, while most people in  Austria generally use Austrian Standard German rather than their local dialect in both informal and formal situations.

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996. The \"sharp s\" (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany. Because of the German language's pluricentric nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of Standard Austrian German spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of Germany or Switzerland. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions.

In May, during the Montreal portion of the bed-in, counterculture figures from across North America visited Lennon, including American psychologist Timothy Leary, an early advocate of LSD whom Lennon admired. Leary intended to run for Governor of California in the following year's election and asked Lennon to write him a campaign song based on the campaign's slogan, \"Come Together – Join the Party!\" The resulting chant was only a line long: \"Come together and join the party\". Lennon promised to finish and record the song, and Leary later recalled Lennon giving him \n\n withdrawing from Paul and The Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep?'. I don't really go 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time ...\" The track \"Imagine\" became Lennon's signature song and was written as a plea for world peace. Years later he acknowledged Ono's role in the song's creation and stated his regret that he had not credited her as a co-writer. \"Jealous Guy\" has also had enduring popularity; it was originally composed as \"Child of Nature\" during the songwriting sessions in India in 1968 that led to the Beatles' double album \n\n Beatles. \"Oh My Love\" and the song \"How?\" were influenced by his experience with primal therapy. Lennon also indulged his love of rock and roll with \"Crippled Inside\" and \"It's So Hard\". \"Gimme Some Truth\", first heard during the Let It Be sessions in early 1969, appears on the album with a new bridge. The politically themed \"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier\" closes the first half of Imagine in a cacophonous manner. The last song on the album was \"Oh Yoko!\"; EMI pushed for this track to be issued as a single, but Lennon thought it was too \"pop\".\n\n a Chuck Berry-styled rocker that details the Lennons' early months in their new home, as well as \"John Sinclair\", his musical plea for Sinclair's release from a ten-year sentence for giving two marijuana joints to an undercover policewoman. Ono, a feminist, responds musically with \"Sisters, O Sisters\", tackles the lacking education system with \"Born in a Prison\", and celebrates a culture of one in \"We're All Water\". The album is generally seen as the beginning of Ono's emergence as a songwriter. Together, Lennon and Ono lament police brutality in \"Attica State\", the hardships of war-torn Northern Ireland in \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"The Luck of the Irish\" (see Bloody Sunday (1972) article), and pay tribute to Angela Davis with \"Angela\".\n\n Imagine is the second studio album by English musician John Lennon, released on 9 September 1971 by Apple Records. Co-produced by Lennon, his wife Yoko Ono and Phil Spector, the album's lush sound contrasts the basic, small-group arrangements of his first album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), while the opening title track is widely considered to be his signature song. Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, Abbey Road Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with supporting musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner. Its lyrics reflect peace, love, politics, Lennon's experience with primal scream therapy, and, following a period of high personal tensions, an attack on his former writing partner Paul McCartney in \n\nQuestion: what type of music did john lennon sing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The delegation has a total of 7 members, including 4 Democrats, and 3 Republicans as of 2018.\n\n The 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado were held on November 8, 2016, to elect the seven U.S. Representatives from the state of Colorado, one from each of the state's seven congressional districts. The elections coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate and various state and local elections. The primaries were held on June 28.\n\n Currently, Democrats control both the House and the Senate. The 64th Colorado General Assembly was the first to be controlled by the Democrats in forty years, as the Republican Party traditionally held control of the state government. Colorado now being a swing state has seen increased competitiveness and consequently, variation in partisan control of the statehouse from election to election. The current Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives is Alec Garnett. The Colorado Senate is the upper house of the Colorado General Assembly, composed of 35 seats of approximately 143,000 people each. Senators are constitutionally limited to two consecutive four-year terms. The Senate is currently composed of 19 Democrats and 16 Republicans. The Senate is led by President of the Senate, Leroy Garcia, Majority Leader Steve Fenberg, and Minority Leader Chris Holbert. The Colorado House of Representatives is the lower house of the Colorado General Assembly, composed of 65 seats of approximately 77,000 people each. Representatives are constitutionally limited to four consecutive two-year terms. The House is currently composed of 41 Democrats and 24 Republicans and is led by Speaker of the House Alec Garnett, Majority Leader Daneya Esgar, and Minority Leader Hugh McKean.\n\n  Colorado is divided into 7 congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. The districts are currently represented in the 117th United States Congress by 4 Democrats and 3 Republicans. Starting in the 2022 mid-term elections, per the 2020 United States census, Colorado will gain a new congressional seat.\n\n 1913. Colorado was represented by four United States representatives elected from two districts and two at-large in the 63rd United States Congress from 1913 until 1915. Since the 1914 United States House of Representatives elections, all U.S. Representatives from the State of Colorado have been elected from congressional districts. Colorado has been represented by four United States representatives from 1913 until the end of the 92nd United States Congress in 1973, five United States representatives from 1973 until the end of the 97th United States Congress in 1983, six United States representatives from 1983 until the end of the 107th United States Congress in 2003, and seven United States representatives since 2003.\n\nQuestion: who are the colorado representatives?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Based in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, the organization was founded on 19 July 1989 by the Government of Greenland.\n\n Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  (LGBT) rights in Greenland are some of the most extensive in the Americas and the world, relatively similar to those in Denmark proper in Europe. Same-sex sexual activity is legal, with an equal age of consent, and there are some anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBT people. Same-sex couples had access to registered partnerships, which provided them with nearly all of the rights provided to married opposite-sex couples, from 1996 to 2016. On 1 April 2016, a law repealing the registered partnership act and allowing for same-sex marriages to be performed came into effect. In 1979, Denmark granted Greenland home rule and in 2009 extended self-government, although it still influences the island's culture and politics. Greenland is considered to be very socially liberal towards LGBT people. Acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex relationships is high, and reports of discrimination against LGBT people are rare. Nonetheless, due to Greenland's small and scattered population, many Greenlandic LGBT people have moved to Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\n In addition to Denmark proper, the Kingdom of Denmark comprises two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Both use the Danish krone as their currency, but form separate economies, having separate national accounts etc. Both countries receive an annual fiscal subsidy from Denmark which amounts to about 25% of Greenland's GDP and 11% of Faroese GDP. For both countries, fishing industry is a major economic activity. Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union. Greenland left the European Economic Community in 1986, and the Faroe Islands declined membership in 1973, when Denmark joined.\n\n Greenland is considered an alpine region of the North American Arctic. Vegetation that grows in this area is confined to mostly narrow coastal ice-free fringes which constitutes about 14% of the total area. Poor floras occur in the colder coastal areas in the northern parts of the country while rich floras occur in the southwest parts and inland in the south.\n\n Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat, ; Grønland, ) is an autonomous territory within the Danish Realm and the world's largest island, located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers) for more than a millennium, beginning in 986. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada, gradually settling across the island by the 13th century. Today, the population is concentrated mainly on the southwest coast, while the rest of the island \n\nQuestion: which country does greenland belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the latitude and longitude of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data.The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for \n\n In the United States, the basic ZIP Code is composed of five numbers. The first three numbers identify a specific sectional center facility—or central sorting facility—that serves a geographic region (typically a large part of a state). The next two numbers identify a specific post office either serving an area of a city (if in an urban area or large suburban area) or an entire village, town, or small city and its surrounding area (if in a small suburban or rural area).

Ray Kay, known for Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\" and Justin Bieber's \"Baby\", directed the clip. In an interview with Rap-Up, Kay said \"I'm certain people that are watching the video will feel inspired to develop their own individuality and freedom and express their own art after seeing Willow in this video.\" Kay also confirmed that the shooting would take two days, and require a lot from Smith, although the director was confident that Smith would \"kill it\" in front of the camera. Later, Kay commented to Rap-Up in a separate piece, \"I think this video will be considered iconic in the future.

Pinkett Smith is of Jamaican and Bajan descent on her mother's side and African-American descent on her father's side. From 2003 to 2005 she resided with her uncle Thomas Pickett outside Jackson, Mississippi. Her parents are Adrienne Banfield-Jones, the head nurse of a Baltimore inner-city clinic, and Robsol Pinkett Jr., who ran a construction company. Banfield-Jones, who during the 2010s became Adrienne Banfield-Norris, became pregnant in high school; the couple married but divorced after several months. Banfield-Jones raised Pinkett with the help of her own mother, Marion Martin Banfield, a Jamaican-born social worker. Banfield noticed her granddaughter's passion for the performing arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons.

A writer for Rap-Up said that Smith \"is in a class of her own in the breakout video for her empowering anthem\", calling the video \"the birth of more B.S.\".\n\n In the summer of 2010, Smith's mother, Jada Pinkett Smith, revealed on Lopez Tonight that her daughter was recording an album. On September 27, 2010, Smith's single was leaked onto the Internet. Time magazine, CNN, and Billboard each featured the song the evening it surfaced. Several celebrities applauded the new single on Twitter, including Ciara, Brandy, Solange Knowles, Britney Spears, and Alfredo Flores.\n\n Madagascar films (2005–2012), Hawthorne (2009–2011), Magic Mike XXL (2015), Bad Moms (2016), and Angel Has Fallen (2019).

The earliest of these is dated to around 1200 BC. There have recently been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings dating back to c. 6000 BC, like Jiahu Script, Banpo Script, but whether or not the carvings are complex enough to qualify as writing is under debate. At Damaidi in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 3,172 cliff carvings dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, featuring 8,453 individual characters, such as the sun, moon, stars, gods, and scenes of hunting or grazing. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script.\n\n Xiao'erjing can be divided into two sets, the \"Mosque system\" and the \"Daily system\". The \"Mosque system\" is the system used by pupils and imams in mosques and madrasahs. It contains much Arabic and Persian religious lexicon, and no usage of Chinese characters. This system is relatively standardised, and could be considered a true writing system. The \"Daily system\" is the system used by the less educated for letters and correspondences on a personal level. Often simple Chinese characters are mixed in with the Arabic script, mostly discussing non-religious matters, and therewith relatively little Arabic and Persian loans. This practice can differ drastically from person to person. The system would be devised by the writer himself, with one's own understanding of the Arabic and Persian alphabets, mapped accordingly \n\n including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. Singapore, which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the de facto standard for younger ethnic \n\n Chinese calligraphy is the stylized, artistic writing of Chinese characters; the written form of Chinese that unites the languages spoken in China. Calligraphy is considered supreme among the visual arts in China and sets the standard for which Chinese painting is judged. Chinese calligraphy and painting are closely related.\n\n There are and have been several Chinese alphabets, that is pre-existing alphabets adapted to write down the Chinese language. However, the standard Chinese writing system uses a non-alphabetic script with an alphabet for supplementary use. There is no original alphabet native to China. China has its Pinyin system though sometimes the term is used anyway to refer to logographic Chinese characters (sinograms). It is more appropriately used, though, for phonemic transcriptions such as pinyin. However, there were attempts to replace the whole Chinese script with alphabets but failed in the end, so the Chinese characters were kept. Simplified Chinese characters replaced Traditional Chinese characters, which the original form is still used today in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. Simplified Chinese is used in mainland China and Singapore.\n\nQuestion: what do you call the chinese writing system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While on Burnett, producer Norman Lear offered Kling the position of head writer on a new emerging show called All in the Family. Ironically, Lear had offered the starring role in the show to Kling's previous star Gleason, and then to Mickey Rooney, who 12 months later toured the country with a play written by Kling. Under Kling, All in the Family became a huge hit for CBS and Lear. Kling drew some of the show's most memorable episodes from his personal life. They included the February 23, 1976 episode \"Joey's Baptism\" in which Archie Bunker's baptizing his grandson (against the wishes of agnostic parents Mike and Gloria), which Kling, who was born atheist, based upon the baptism of his son Anthony at the time. In less than half a decade, Burnett and All in the Family brought Kling seven Emmy nominations, and two Emmy Awards.

Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, and complex systemic problems in the command economy, Soviet output stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the proxies of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic Regions republics and Eastern Europe. Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader and General Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, created \n\n reform to galvanise the economy. However, by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. The industrial production system in the Soviet Union suffered a political and economic collapse in 1991, after which a transition from centrally planned to market-driven economies occurred. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic integration of the Soviet republics was dissolved, and overall industrial activity declined substantially. A lasting legacy remains in the physical infrastructure created during decades of combined industrial production practices.\n\n oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership. Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was succeeded by Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Vasili Kuznetsov, the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was succeeded by Andrei Gromyko, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Several Soviet Socialist Republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The USSR's trade gap progressively emptied the coffers of the union, leading to eventual bankruptcy. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when Boris Yeltsin seized power in the aftermath of a failed coup that had attempted to topple reform-minded Gorbachev.\n\n time created conscious nations. Furthermore, the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet Union's federative system—that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples – eased the task of secession and independence. On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\". An opinion piece by Gorbachev written in April 2006 stated: \"The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" The collapse of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise. Before 1991, many thought that the collapse of the Soviet Union was impossible.\n\n The dissolution of the Soviet Union (1988–1991) was the process of internal political, economic and ethnic disintegration within the USSR as an unintended result of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's effort of reform of the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to end the Era of Stagnation, which resulted in the end of its existence as a sovereign state. In late 1991, the leaders of three of the Union’s founding and largest republics (the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR) declared that the Soviet Union no longer existed, and 11 more republics joined them shortly thereafter. Gorbachev had to first retire as leader of the Communist Party since it \n\nQuestion: what made the soviet union fall?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although the acceptance of human antiquity and natural selection originated from separate intellectual traditions, they had a powerful influence on scientific thinking during this time.\n\nThe consensus on 'the antiquity of man' was established by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, just two months before the publication of Charles Darwin's influential work, \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. This consensus, including the understanding that humans had a long history on Earth, provided a crucial foundation for the intelligibility and eventual acceptance of evolution by natural selection.\n\nIn the Australian colonies, the understanding of human antiquity was not widely recognized until much later, around the 1960s with the introduction of radiocarbon dating and professional archaeology. However, recent reassessments challenge this narrative and shed light on the early decades of human antiquity's dissemination in Australia.\n\nBy examining the complex relationship between human antiquity and natural selection, scholars have started to highlight how the acceptance of human antiquity influenced the understanding and acceptance of evolution by natural selection in the nineteenth century. These intertwined theories expanded scientific perspectives and opened up new possibilities for understanding human origins and development.\n\nOverall, the acceptance of human antiquity in Australia, along with the broader understanding of evolution by natural selection, revolutionized scientific thinking and laid the groundwork for further exploration and discoveries in the field of anthropology and evolutionary biology.\n\n He carefully argues out this theory by presenting accumulated scientific evidence from his voyage on the Beagle in the 1830s, and from his continuing studies up to the date of publication. His studies continued with the book being revised accordingly; the most extensive revisions were the 6th and final edition. ; Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences.

In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. It was first published on November 24, 1859 and the initial print run was oversubscribed by booksellers at Murray's Autumn sale the day before. ; Darwin presents a theory of natural selection that is in most aspects identical to the theories now accepted by \n\n  Charles Darwin's studies at the University of Cambridge included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing \"books to be read\", including \"Paley's Nat. Theology\". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend \"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\" He later stated in \n\n After his seminal work in developing theories of natural selection, Charles Darwin devoted much of his final years to the study of animal emotions and psychology. He wrote two books;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872 that dealt with topics related to evolutionary psychology. He introduced the concepts of sexual selection to explain the presence of animal structures that seemed unrelated to survival, such as the peacock's tail. He also introduced theories concerning group selection and kin selection to explain altruism.

The scandal stemmed from the Nixon administration's continual attempts to cover up its involvement in the June 17, 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Washington, D.C. Watergate Office Building. After the five perpetrators were arrested, the press and the U.S. Justice Department connected the cash found on them at the time to the Nixon re-election campaign committee.

The issue was designed by Daniel Schwarz, and printed in combination offset-intaglio process by the Banknote Corporation of America. Richard Milhous Nixon, (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the United States from 1969 to 1974. Nixon's political career started as a California representative. He was Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president for two terms and was defeated in 1960 by John F. Kennedy for the presidential election. In 1968, Nixon won the presidency and was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1972. Nixon was the only person to be elected twice to both the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. He was also the only U.S. president to resign the office. Nixon was instrumental in ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and establishing U.S. relations with communist China.\n\n On April 22, 1994, Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th president of the United States, died after suffering a stroke four days earlier, at the age of 81, which causes to brain damage and cerebral edema.

He had previously served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963 under President John F. Kennedy. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level. Born in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked \n\nOn August 27, 1973, the US Post Office issued the 8-cent Lyndon B. Johnson memorial postage stamp, first placed on sale at the Post Office in Austin, Texas. The stamp was designed by Bradbury Thompson. ; Johnson's last appearance (to date) on a U.S. postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on one of the AMERIPEX issues of 1986. Lyndon B. Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973) was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969, served as vice president during the Kennedy administration. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Johnson assumed the presidency. He won election to a full term, in 1964 with 61 percent of the vote and served until January 20, 1969.\n\n Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the 17th president of the United States, serving from 1865 to 1869. He assumed the presidency as he was vice president at the time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson was a Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, coming to office as the Civil War concluded. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote. Johnson was born into \n\n The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. They defeated Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater and vice presidential nominee William Miller. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right. Despite Johnson's uncertainty about running, he was seen as the most likely candidate to get the nomination. He entered the primaries starting with New Hampshire and won the state by almost 29,000 votes. Johnson's main opponent \n\n Johnson went from his victory in the 1964 election to launch the Great Society program at home, signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and starting the War on Poverty. He also escalated the Vietnam War, which significantly reduced his popularity. As he had served less than 24 months of Kennedy's term, he was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under 22nd Amendment. Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him. Johnson's internal polling showed his trailing to Kennedy. On March 31, 1968, Johnson shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\" While campaigning, Kennedy was assassinated shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After Kennedy's assassination, the Democratic party nominated Vice president Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. Humphrey later lost the election to former vice president Richard Nixon.\n\nQuestion: who was vice president when jfk was president?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Exacerbated by the Yugoslav Wars that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalists on all sides resumed insisting Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin were distinct languages in their own right, undermining the project of Serbo-Croatian linguistic unity. The Bosnian language was originally primarily expressed in the Cyrillic-type Bosančica since the 11th century (originally alongside the older Glagoljica), but it was gradually driven extinct in the 18th century after the Ottoman introduction of the Perso-Arabic script-type Arebica (15th–20th century). Eventually, most Bosnians adopted the Croatian-derived Latinica or Latin script –originally introduced by the Catholic Franciscans – in the course of the 20th century, standardised in the 1990s.\n\n Cyrillic is in official use in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although Bosnian \"officially accept[s] both alphabets\", the Latin script is almost always used in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas Cyrillic is in everyday use in Republika Srpska. The Serbian language in Croatia is officially recognized as a minority language; however, the use of Cyrillic in bilingual signs has sparked protests and vandalism. Cyrillic is an important symbol of Serbian identity. In Serbia, official documents are printed in Cyrillic only even though, according to a 2014 survey, 47% of the Serbian population write in the Latin alphabet whereas 36% write in Cyrillic.\n\n The Serbian language is officially used in 23 cities and municipalities in Croatia. In April 2015 the United Nations Human Rights Committee urged Croatia to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet. The committee report stated that particularly concerns surrounded the use of Serbian Cyrillic in the town of Vukovar and municipalities concerned. Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dačić stated that Serbia welcomed the UN Human Rights Committee's report. Although the 2011 census in Croatia listed Serbs as the largest national minority in Croatia, with 4.4% of the total population, the number of people who had declared Serbian language as their native was only 1.23% of the total population (52,879).\n\n Serbian Language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet is the second official language in the municipality of Borovo alongside with the Croatian language which is official at the national level. Both Serbian and Croatian language are standardized varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. According to the municipal Statute, individuals who are members of the Serbian national minority are ensured the freedom of expression of national belonging and freedom to use their language and script in public and private use on the whole territory of the Municipality of Borovo.

Serbian is an official language in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and is a recognized minority language in Montenegro (although spoken by a plurality of population), Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The decades that followed became known as the Golden Age of Athenian democracy, during which time Athens became the leading city of Ancient Greece, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for Western civilization. The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates. \n\n (c. undefined 1600–c. undefined 1100 BC) Mycenaean Greece (or the Mycenaean civilization) was the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, spanning the period from approximately 1600–1100 BC. It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system. The most prominent site was Mycenae, in the Argolid, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the coast of Asia Minor, the Levant, Cyprus, and Italy.\n\n Athens (Αθήνα ; (pl.) ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent—particularly Ancient Rome. In modern times, Athens \n\n The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages in the 8th century BC. Greece became divided into small self-governing communities, and adopted the Phoenician alphabet, modifying it to create the Greek alphabet. By the 6th century BC several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes, of which Athens, Sparta, and Corinth were closest to the Aegean Sea. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC many Greeks emigrated to form colonies in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy and Sicily), Asia Minor and further afield. The Aegean Sea was the setting for one of the most pivotal naval engagements in history, when on September 20, 480 B.C. the Athenian fleet gained \n\n Historical city-states included Sumerian cities such as Uruk and Ur; Ancient Egyptian city-states, such as Thebes and Memphis; the Phoenician cities (such as Tyre and Sidon); the five Philistine city-states; the Berber city-states of the Garamantes; the city-states of ancient Greece (the poleis such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Corinth); the Roman Republic (which grew from a city-state into a vast empire); the Italian city-states from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, such as Florence, Siena, Ferrara, Milan (which as they grew in power began to dominate neighboring cities) and Genoa and Venice, which became powerful thalassocracies; the Mayan and other cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (including cities such as Chichen Itza, Tikal, Copán and Monte Albán); the central Asian cities along the Silk Road; the city-states of the Swahili coast; Ragusa; states of the medieval Russian lands such as Novgorod and Pskov; and many others.

Dunlap printed perhaps 200 broadsides, since known as the Dunlap broadsides, which were the first published versions of the Declaration.

By June, nine Provincial Congresses were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. Richard Henry Lee was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On June 11, a committee was created by the Second Continental Congress to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The Declaration of Independence was drafted largely by Thomas Jefferson and presented by the committee; it was unanimously adopted by \n\n of the Constitution\". The Articles of Confederation 200th anniversary was celebrated with a 13-cent stamp on September 30, 1977. While the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson, Virginian Richard Henry Lee moved for \"a plan of Confederation\". The draft was completed in York Town, Pennsylvania on November 15, 1777, but it was not finally approved until Maryland ratified five years later, after Virginia and other states with western claims ceded territory to the U.S. government.

Congress shortly thereafter officially changed the nation's name to the \"United States of America\" from the \"United Colonies of America\". The new nation was founded on Enlightenment ideals of liberalism and what Thomas Jefferson called the unalienable rights to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\". It was dedicated strongly to republican principles, which emphasized that people are sovereign (not hereditary kings), demanded civic duty, feared corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.\n\n appointed to the committee which drafted the Declaration of Independence, along with himself and Benjamin Franklin.

Genetic tests for these diseases are available to detect whether an unborn baby has a defective gene or whether two potential parents would likely produce an affected baby. And knowing what causes the diseases enables researchers to focus on ways to possibly cure them. Discovering Modern Genetic Principles\n\nGregor Mendel, a mid-19th century Austrian monk, used pea plants to perform the fundamental studies of heredity that serve as the basis for genetic concepts to this day. Because pea plants have a number of readily observable traits — smooth peas versus wrinkled peas, tall plants versus short plants, and so on — Mendel was able to observe the results of cross-pollinating and growing various varieties of pea plants. Through his experiments, Mendel established that genetic factors are passed from parents to offspring and remain unchanged in the offspring so that they can be passed on again to the next generation. Although his work was done before the discovery of DNA and chromosomes, the genetic principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment that Mendel originally defined are still used to this day. Evolving the Theory of Natural Selection\n\nCharles Darwin's study of giant tortoises and finches on the Galapagos Islands led to his famous theory of natural selection (also known as \"survival of the fittest\"), which he published in his 1859 book titled On the Origin of Species. The main point of Darwin's theory is that organisms with traits that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations.Thus, over time, the traits seen in a population of organisms in a given area can change.The significance of Darwin's theory of natural selection can be seen today in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Formulating Cell Theory\n\nIn 1839, zoologist Theodor Schwann and botanist Matthias Schleiden were talking at a dinner party about their research.\n\n the Origin of Species. ; (Online: 6th Edition (text)) ; The Origin of Species is one of the hallmark works of biology. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. It was first published on November 24, 1859 and the initial print run was oversubscribed by booksellers at Murray's Autumn sale the day before. ; Darwin presents a theory of natural selection that is in most aspects identical to the theories now accepted by \n\n Between 1868 and 1872, the life and work of Charles Darwin from Descent of Man to Emotions continued with aspects of his intended \"Big Book\" on evolution through natural selection. He had by then hurriedly published an \"abstract\" of this work as On the Origin of Species in 1859, and following the immediate reaction to Darwin's theory his earlier work included demonstrating the utility of the flowers of Orchids in directing insect pollination to achieve cross fertilisation, and a summing up of thirteen years of experiments in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication which went on sale on 30 January 1868. He now published his ideas on human evolution and on how beautiful but apparently impractical features could have evolved in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. After revising The Origin of Species as the definitive 6th edition, his major works on species culminated in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. This period was followed by extensive work on insectivorous plants and research into worms.\n\n  Charles Darwin's studies at the University of Cambridge included two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing \"books to be read\", including \"Paley's Nat. Theology\". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend \"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\" He later stated in \n\n After his seminal work in developing theories of natural selection, Charles Darwin devoted much of his final years to the study of animal emotions and psychology. He wrote two books;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872 that dealt with topics related to evolutionary psychology. He introduced the concepts of sexual selection to explain the presence of animal structures that seemed unrelated to survival, such as the peacock's tail. He also introduced theories concerning group selection and kin selection to explain altruism.

Serbian Carpathians]] Divisions of the Carpathians are a categorization of the Carpathian mountains system. Below is a detailed overview of the major subdivisions and ranges of the Carpathian Mountains. The Carpathians are a \"subsystem\" of a bigger Alps-Himalaya System that stretches from western Europe all the way to southern Asia, and are further divided into \"provinces\" and \"subprovinces\". The last level of the division, i.e. the actual mountain ranges and basins, is usually classified as \"units\". The main divisions are shown in the map on the right. To generalize, there are three major provinces (regions): Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians, and the Southern Carpathians.\n\nWhite Carpathians (CZ: Bílé Karpaty, SK: Biele Karpaty), which encompasses the Biele Karpaty Protected Landscape Area within Slovakia and the Bílé Karpaty Protected Landscape Area in the Czech Republic ; Javorníky (CZ+SK; \"Maple Mountains\"), including the two highest points in these ranges, Veľký Javorník at 3,514 feet (1,071 metres) and Malý Javorník (1,021 metres) ; Myjava Hills (SK: Myjavská pahorkatina), rugged highlands along the Myjava River ; Váh Valley Land (SK: Považské podolie) along the Váh River ; Vizovice Highlands (CZ: Vizovická vrchovina), rugged highlands within the Zlín Region, including the highest peak, Klášťov  The Slovak-Moravian Carpathians (CZ/SK: Slovensko-moravské Karpaty) are the mountain ranges along the border of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Before the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, it was known in Hungarian as Magyar-morva határhegység 'the Hungarian-Moravian border mountains'. Geologically these ranges are part of the Outer Western Carpathians group of the Western Carpathians, and are composed mainly of flysch sediment.  The Slovak-Moravian Carpathians consist of: \n\n The Western Carpathians are a mountain range and geomorphological province that forms the western part of the Carpathian Mountains. The mountain belt stretches from the Low Beskids range of the Eastern Carpathians along the border of Poland with Slovakia toward the Moravian region of the Czech Republic and the Austrian Weinviertel. In the south the North Hungarian Mountains cover northern Hungary. The area of the Western Carpathians comprises about 70,000 km². The highest elevation is the Gerlachovský štít (2,655m).\n\n range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is Śnieżka (1,602 meters) in the Karkonosze Mountains. The Carpathians in Poland, formed as a discrete topographical unit in the relatively recent Tertiary Era, are the highest mountains in the country. They are the northernmost edge of a much larger range that extends into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary, and Romania. Within Poland the range includes two major basins, the Oświęcim and Sandomierz, which are rich in several minerals and natural gas. To the north of the central lowlands, the lake region includes primeval forests - one of the last remaining in Europe and \n\nQuestion: where is the carpathian mountain range located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, known as Burns Night (Burns Nicht; also called Robert Burns Day or Rabbie Burns Day). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year. Burns suppers are held all around the world.\n\n Biblical, and English literature, as well as the Scottish Makar tradition. Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language. Some of his works, such as \"Love and Liberty\" (also known as \"The Jolly Beggars\"), are written in both Scots and English for various effects. His themes included republicanism, Radicalism, Scottish patriotism, anticlericalism, class inequalities, gender roles, commentary on the Scottish Kirk of his time, Scottish cultural identity, poverty, sexuality, and the beneficial aspects of popular socialising. Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and \n\n be a key cultural heritage event.\"The Parliament welcomes the annual celebration of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns, which is held on 25 January each year to mark the Bard’s birthday; considers that Burns was one of the greatest poets and that his work has influenced thinkers across the world; notes that Burns' first published collection, Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, also known as the 'Kilmarnock Edition', published in 1786, did much to popularise and champion the Scots language, and considers that this is one of his most important legacies; believes that the celebration of Burns Night is an opportunity to raise awareness of the cultural significance of Scots and its status as one \n\n work often celebrated his native Edinburgh, as in his best known poem \"Auld Reekie\" (1773).

Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the famous 17th century microscopist, discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call dental plaque). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or \n\n Before automated cell counters were introduced, cell counts were performed manually; white and red blood cells, and platelets were counted using microscopes. The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, improvements in microscope technology such as achromatic lenses allowed white blood cells and platelets to be counted in unstained \n\nThe invention of the microscope is credited to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. He was a Dutch scientist who lived in the 17th century. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is often referred to as the Father of Microbiology and is renowned for his groundbreaking work in the field of microscopy. He was the first person to develop and use powerful microscopes to observe and document a variety of microorganisms, which were previously unseen by the naked eye. Van Leeuwenhoek's discoveries significantly advanced the understanding of the microscopic world and laid the foundation for modern microbiology. His contributions revolutionized the way we perceive the world and uncover the intricate details of living organisms.\n\nSome notable scientists who contributed to the development of the microscope and its use in scientific research include Marcello Malpighi, Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, and Georgios Nicholas Papanikolaou.\n\nMarcello Malpighi (1628-1694) was an Italian anatomist and biologist who made important contributions to the field of microscopy. He used microscopes to study the structure and function of various organs and tissues in plants and animals, making significant discoveries on topics such as the pulmonary circulation of blood and the structure of the lungs.\n\nAnton Philips van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was a Dutch biologist known as the \"Father of Microbiology.\" He is credited with improving the design of the microscope and making groundbreaking observations using his highly advanced microscopes. Van Leeuwenhoek discovered and described various microorganisms, such as bacteria, protists, and sperm cells, providing valuable insights into the microscopic world.\n\nRobert Hooke (1635-1703), an English scientist, played a crucial role in the advancement of microscopy. His innovative work with compound microscopes allowed him to make detailed observations of various specimens. Hooke's book \"Micrographia\" published in 1665 showcased his observations and discoveries, including the first recorded observation of biological cells, which he named \"cells\" due to their resemblance to living quarters of monks.\n\nGeorgios Nicholas Papanikolaou (1883-1962) was a Greek-American physician and researcher who significantly contributed to the development of the microscope through his work on cytology. Papanikolaou is best known for developing the Pap smear, a technique used for detecting cervical cancer. By utilizing the microscope, he identified cellular changes associated with cancer, revolutionizing the field of cytopathology.\n\nThese scientists played critical roles in improving microscope design, expanding our understanding of microscopic structures, and pioneering various research techniques. Their contributions have paved the way for countless advancements in medicine and scientific research.\n\nThe invention and development of the microscope is attributed to several individuals who played crucial roles in advancing this revolutionary instrument. One of the most notable figures associated with the microscope is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist in the 17th century. Leeuwenhoek is often considered the father of microbiology for his groundbreaking observations using microscopes he designed himself. He was the first to accurately describe and document microorganisms like bacteria, red blood cells, and spermatozoa. His discoveries laid the foundation for our understanding of the microscopic world.\n\nAnother significant contributor to the development of the microscope is Robert Hooke, an English scientist. In 1665, Hooke published \"Micrographia,\" a notable book that detailed his observations using a compound microscope. In this work, he coined the term \"cell\" after observing the cellular structure of cork. Hooke's book not only popularized the microscope but also introduced the concept of cells, which revolutionized the field of biology.\n\nFurthermore, there were other scientists who made important contributions to microscopy, such as Zacharias Janssen and his father Hans Janssen, who are credited with inventing the first compound microscope around 1590. Additionally, scientists like Ernst Abbe, Carl Zeiss, and Rudolf Virchow made significant advancements in microscope technology, leading to the development of more modern and powerful microscopes.\n\nOverall, the microscope has a vast history associated with numerous individuals, including Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Zacharias and Hans Janssen, Ernst Abbe, Carl Zeiss, and Rudolf Virchow, among others. Their collective efforts, discoveries, and inventions have contributed significantly to our understanding of the microscopic world and have paved the way for advancements in various scientific disciplines.\n\nQuestion: what did anton van leeuwenhoek contribute to our knowledge of cells?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wickström led the company until the end of his life, and he was an appreciated manager. He believed that the robust middle engines, which the company produced, would stay competitive on the market; he considered outboard engines to be rubbish and did not believe in their future. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time. After Wickström's death in 1959, the company kept existing for a couple of decades. By then, the Wickström company had lost the spirit of innovation, although the main reason for its decline was the spread of outboard engines and subsequent disappearing of its market.\n\n Gale Products was a manufacturer of several products based in Galesburg, Illinois.

After building over one million motors, the parent company OMC ceased boat motor manufacturing reusing the facility as the new headquarters and factory of Lawn-Boy lawn mowers. Eventually, Lawn-Boy was sold to its competitor Toro where offices were moved to Minnesota and manufacturing was moved to other Toro facilities. The factory was closed in the mid-1980's.\n\n 60 plants in 31 countries and with a sales reach in 190 countries. It even experienced a one-year growth of 33.7 per cent in 2003 with the sales turn over reaching US$16.8157 billion. The next year saw Suzuki becoming the largest small car manufacturer in Japan, The two wheeler division, the third behind Honda and Yamaha and the outboard engine division making rapid strides. Suzuki Corporation made a record profit of ¥107.5 billion and its shares rose 13 per cent against the 3.5 percent decline experienced by the market. Osamu Suzuki led the formation of a capital alliance with competitor Toyota Motor Corp in 2019 in a bid to partner in the development of self-driving vehicles.\n\n The Yamaha V series are two-stroke step-through motorcycles made by the Yamaha Motor Company. There were a number of different engine capacities to suit different sections of the market. The bike was primarily released to compete with the ever-popular Honda Super Cub. It is also very similar to the Suzuki FR50.\n\n The Yamaha 29 was a sailboat manufactured by Yamaha. On request from Yamaha, Group Finot in France designed the boat in 1973. The hull is based on the same classical design as the Morbic III who won the Fastnet the same year. The layout is innovative with a center cockpit and the main cabin in the rear. The Yamaha team with Mr Horinshi was very impressed with the design, and two prototypes were made in 1975. Even though the boat got good reviews from press and owners, only 55 were built in total. About 5 of those were sold to Norway. \n\nQuestion: where are yamaha outboard motors manufactured?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The international community condemned the invasion, and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the Gulf War to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Following the Gulf War, the US and its allies tried to keep Saddam Hussein in check with a policy of containment. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the US and the UK to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shias in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections to ensure \n\n Egypt played a key role during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis. President Mubarak helped assemble the international coalition and deployed 35,000 Egyptian troops against Iraq to liberate Kuwait. The Egyptian contingent was one of the largest in the coalition forces, along with the U.S., U.K. and Saudi Arabia. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Egypt signed the Damascus Declaration with Syria and the Persian Gulf states to strengthen Persian Gulf security. Egypt continues to contribute regularly to United Nations peacekeeping missions, most recently in East Timor, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Egypt, which has itself been the target of terrorist attacks, has been a key supporter of the U.S. war against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, and has supported the Iraqi Governing Council. On \n\n During the Gulf War of 1990–1991, Coalition air forces faced the Iraqi Air Force, the fourth largest air force in the world at the time. In the opening days of the war, many air-air engagements occurred, between Iraqi interceptors and a variety of different Coalition aircraft.\n\n In the biggest mobilisation of Australian Forces since the Vietnam War, the Government committed Australian naval forces to the 1991 Gulf War in support of the United States led coalition against the regime of Saddam Hussein, following the invasion of oil-rich Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August 1990. The United States amassed a 30 nation coalition of some 30,000 troops and the UN Security Council issued an ultimatum to Iraq for the withdrawal. Operation Desert Storm, an air bombardment, followed by a 43-day war followed Iraq's failure to withdraw. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) provided vessels for the multi-national naval force, patrolling the Persian Gulf to enforce the UN sanctions. The Government elected to maintain an Australian naval presence in the Gulf following the surrender of Iraq and 1991 Peace Treaty. Ultimately, though Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, its failure to adhere to other conditions of the 1991 Treaty led to the second Iraq War a decade later. In an address to the nation explaining Australia's involvement, Hawke said that to protect small nations, sometimes \"tragically\", we must fight for peace.\n\n The Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 – 28 February 1991) was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait. The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War, or the First Iraq War, after the term \"Iraq War\" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\").

Written on oracle bones – animal bones or turtle plastrons – it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The bones were believed to have prophecies written on them. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as \"oracle bone inscriptions\" comes in the form of inscribed ox scapulae and turtle plastrons from sites near modern Anyang (安阳) on the northern border of Henan province. The vast majority were found at the Yinxu site in this region. They record pyromantic divinations of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty, beginning with Wu Ding, whose accession is dated by different scholars at 1250 BC or 1200 BC. Though there is no proof that the Shang dynasty was solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place. The late Shang oracle bone writings constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and it is also the oldest known member and ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts, preceding the Chinese bronze inscriptions.\n\n The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script yet discovered is the body of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze from the late Shang dynasty. The earliest of these is dated to around 1200 BC. There have recently been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings dating back to c. 6000 BC, like Jiahu Script, Banpo Script, but whether or not the carvings are complex enough to qualify as writing is under debate. At Damaidi in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 3,172 cliff carvings dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, featuring 8,453 individual characters, such as the sun, moon, stars, gods, and scenes of hunting or grazing. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script.\n\n In ancient China, the oldest known Chinese characters are oracle bone script (甲骨文), carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons, because the rulers in the Shang Dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978). With the development of Jīnwén (Bronzeware script) and Dàzhuàn (Large Seal Script) \"cursive\" signs continued. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most famous and typical Bronzeware scripts in Chinese calligraphic history. It has 500 characters on the \n\n The script was originally used as a prompt for the recitation of ritual texts. For inventories, contracts, and letters, the geba script was used. Milnor concludes it is \"unlikely that it [the Dongba script] would make the minor developmental leap to becoming a full-blown writing system. It arose a number of centuries ago to serve a particular ritual purpose. As its purpose need not expand to the realm of daily use among non-religious specialists—after all, literate Naxi today, as in the past, write in Chinese—at most it will presumably but continue to fulfill the needs of demon exorcism, amusing tourists and the like.\" Tourists to southern China are likely to encounter Dongba in the Ancient City of Lijiang where many businesses are adorned with signs in three languages: Dongba, Chinese, and English.\n\n The Dongba script appears to be an independent ancient writing system, though presumably it was created in the environment of older scripts. According to Dongba religious fables, the Dongba script was created by the founder of the Bön religious tradition of Tibet, Tönpa Shenrab (Tibetan: ston pa gshen rab) or Shenrab Miwo (Tibetan: gshen rab mi bo), while traditional Naxi genealogies attribute the script to a 13th Century king named Móubǎo Āzōng. From Chinese historical documents, it is clear that dongba was used as early as the 7th century, during the early Tang Dynasty. By the Song Dynasty in the 10th century, dongba was widely used by the Naxi people. It continues to be used in certain areas; thus, it is the only pictographic writing system in the \n\nQuestion: what was the ancient chinese writing system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Spanish General Francisco Vásquez de Coronado went to North America to explore the land. While at the Zuni villages, he learned of the Hopi tribe. Coronado dispatched Pedro de Tovar and other members of their party to find the Hopi villages. The Spanish wrote that the first Hopi village they visited was Awatovi. They noted that there were about 16,000 Hopi and Zuni people. A few years later, the Spanish explorer García López de Cárdenas investigated the Rio Grande and met the Hopi. They warmly entertained Cardenas and his men and directed him on his journey. In 1582–1583 the Hopi were visited by Antonio de Espejo’s expedition. He noted \n\n After the Marcos de Niza expedition in south-eastern Arizona in 1539, Coronado also explored several regions of the present state in 1540-1542, while searching for Cíbola. In 1604, Juan de Oñate travelled to the Colorado River from New Mexico. The Oñate expedition traveled by way of Zuñi and Hopi territories, and the Bill Williams River to the Colorado River. Arizona was incorporated into New Spain. Northern Arizona belonged to Las Californias, the Southwest belonged to Sonora, particularly Pimería Alta, and the southeast belonged to Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico. However, only a small settler community formed in Arizona. Father Kino's expedition to Arizona established a mission in Tumacacori, \n\n The Coronado expedition had the primary motivation of finding the silk and spices of the Indies as well as gold, silver, and land for forced-labor encomienda estates. The Coronado expedition was huge in size, with about 350 Spaniard men-at-arms, a large number of spouses, slaves, and servants, and as many as 2,000 Mexican Indian allies, mostly warriors from Aztec, Purépecha, and other tribes from central and western Mexico. The expedition also brought thousands of livestock, including horses, mules, sheep, cattle, and perhaps pigs. As soon as Coronado entered present-day New Mexico, he attacked and conquered the Zuni pueblo of Hawikuh, also known as Hawikku, Cíbola, or Cibola. He was visited there soon after by a delegation from Pecos Pueblo (now Pecos National Historical Park). One of the leaders of this delegation, after exchanging gifts, offered to guide the expedition to Pecos and the buffalo herds of the Great Plains. He had a mustache, which was unusual for a Native American, and so the Spaniards called him Bigotes (Spanish for \"mustaches\"). Coronado sent Hernando de Alvarado as commander for the journey.\n\n Cardenas and his party arrived in Arizona, which at the time was part of \"New Mexico\", in 1540. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado searched for the Seven Cities of Cibola and camped some sixty miles east of what was to become Holbrook. Coronado sent an expedition west to find the Colorado River, and they crossed the Little Colorado River some twenty-five miles east of the future Holbrook site and found a colorful area which they named \"El Desierto Pintada\" (The Painted Desert). The expedition was then led by the Hopis to the Grand Canyon. The area became part of Mexico when Mexico gained its independence from Spain.\n\n Spanish explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado spent the winter of 1541-1542 at what is now the area of Bonner Springs. The diary of Father Juan Padilla records that the expedition reached the 40th degree (Kansas northern border) and came to a great river (the Missouri). An inscription found on a stone near Atchison has been translated as, \"Thus far came Francisco de Coronado, General of an Expedition.\" The explorers traveled downstream to the mouth of another great river, the Kansas, and preceded upstream 16 leagues to camp in what is now Bonner Springs before returning to Mexico. Due to the mineral springs, this legend gave the area its first recorded name, \"Coronado Springs\".\n\nQuestion: where did francisco coronado come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.\n\nEgyptian Arabic is spoken by around 53 million people in Egypt (55 million worldwide). It is one of the most understood varieties of Arabic, due in large part to the widespread distribution of Egyptian films and television shows throughout the Arabic-speaking world ; Levantine Arabic includes North Levantine Arabic, South Levantine Arabic and Cypriot Arabic. It is spoken by about 21 million people in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Cyprus and Turkey. ; Lebanese Arabic is a variety of Levantine Arabic spoken primarily in Lebanon. ; Jordanian Arabic is a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of Levantine Arabic spoken by the population of the Kingdom of Jordan. ; \n\n  Arabic is currently Egypt's official language. It came to Egypt in the 7th century, and it is the formal and official language of the state which is used by the government and newspapers. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Arabic dialect or Masri is the official spoken language of the people. Of the many varieties of Arabic, the Egyptian dialect is the most widely spoken and the most understood, due to the great influence of Egyptian cinema and the Egyptian media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Today many foreign students tend to learn it throughout Egyptian songs and movies, and the dialect is usually labelled by the general public as one of the \n\nQuestion: what language does egyptian people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Haran is the father of Lot, who is Abram's nephew; the entire family live in Ur of the Chaldees. Haran dies in his native city, Ur of the Chaldees. Abram marries Sarah (Sarai), who is barren, and on the death of Terah, Abram, Sarai, and Lot depart for Canaan, but settle in a place named Haran, where Terah died at the age of 205. God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to Shechem in Canaan. Then he pitched his tent in the east of Bethel.\n\n The Patriarchs in Hebrew bible are Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob, also named Israel, the ancestor of the Israelites. These three figures are referred to collectively as the patriarchs of Judaism, and the period in which they lived is known as the patriarchal age. The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation, Isaac, Abraham's son by his half-sister Sarah, inherits God's promises to Abraham. Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebecca and regarded as a Patriarch of the Israelites as his twelve sons became the progenitors of the \"Tribes of Israel\".\n\n to Hagar's son as \"the son of the maidservant\" rather than \"your [Avraham's] son\"; later rabbinic sources deduce from this that a Jewish man's child is considered \"his\" child only if the mother is Jewish. Isaac married Rebekah, who came from the same family as Abraham. Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through his brother, Nahor, and his great-great niece through Milcah, daughter of his brother, Haran. They had Jacob and Esau. Esau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women (neither from the family of Abraham), and a third woman was from the family of Ishmael. Esau's offspring, the Edomites, were considered non-Jewish. Jacob, Isaac's other son, was married to Leah and Rachel, who were Jacob's first cousins. Rachel and Leah were both Abraham's great-great \n\n Sarah died, and Abraham buried her in the Cave of the Patriarchs (the \"cave of Machpelah\"), near Hebron which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from Ephron the Hittite. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a concubine named Keturah, by whom he had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. According to the Bible, reflecting the change of his name to \"Abraham\" meaning \"a father of many nations\", Abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the Bible, among others the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Edomites, Amalekites, Kenizzites, Midianites and Assyrians, and through his nephew Lot he was also related to the Moabites and Ammonites. Abraham lived to see his son marry Rebekah, and to see the birth of his twin grandsons Jacob and Esau. He died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael.\n\n In Jewish tradition, Abraham is called Avraham Avinu (אברהם אבינו), \"our father Abraham,\" signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת). Ḥanan b. Rava taught in Abba b. Aybo's name that Abraham's mother was named ʾĂmatlaʾy bat Karnebo. Ḥiyya b. Abba taught that Abraham worked in Teraḥ's idol shop in his youth.

A few anthems have words by Nobel laureates in literature. The first Asian laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote the words and music of \"Jana Gana Mana\" and \"Amar Shonar Bangla\", later adopted as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh respectively. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson wrote the lyrics for the Norwegian national anthem \"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\". Other countries had their anthems composed by locally important people. This is the case for Colombia, whose anthem's lyrics were written by former president and poet Rafael Nuñez, who also wrote the country's first constitution, and in Malta, written by Dun Karm Psaila, already a National Poet. A similar case is Liberia, the national anthem of which was written by its third president, Daniel Bashiel Warner.\n\n West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem. Tagore thus became the only person ever to have written the national anthems of two nations.

Composed by Rabindranath Tagore, the song originally had lyrics in the Bengali language.  A Hindi-language version was adopted in 1950 as the Republic's anthem. \n\n The National Anthem of India is titled ‘Jana Gana Mana’. The song was originally composed in Bengali by India’s first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on December 11, 1911. The parent song, ‘Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata’ is a Brahmo hymn which has five verses and only the first verse has been adopted as National Anthem. If put forwards succinctly, the National Anthem conveys the spirit of pluralism or in more popular term the concept of ‘Unity in Diversity’, which lies at the core of India’s cultural heritage. The poem was first publicly recited on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta (now \n\n Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore. The first stanza of the song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately 52 seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20 seconds to play) is also staged occasionally. It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.\n\nQuestion: who wrote the jana gana mana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Janny Scott, an author and former New York Times reporter, published a biography about Ann Dunham's life titled A Singular Woman in 2011. Posthumous interest has also led to the creation of The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, as well as the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, intended to fund students associated with the East–West Center (EWC) in Honolulu, Hawaii. In an interview, Barack Obama referred to his mother as \"the dominant figure in my formative years ... The values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how I go about the world of politics.\"\n\n In 1999, when Barack Obama was running for the seat in the House of Representatives, he paid a visit to Sweet and gave her a copy of his book, Dreams from My Father, which she says she put on a bookshelf and never opened it up until June 2004, as his popularity rose and he had given his speech at the Democratic National Convention. In a 2008 interview, Sweet said, \"Obama came in and had a very lucky break to come in 90-something, make some of the right connections, and have an opening.\" Unimpressed with his rise in popularity, she \n\n to hope ... that's the real word God will have us hear from this passage and from Watt's painting.\" Having attended Wright's sermon, Obama later adapted Wright's phrase \"audacity to hope\" to \"audacity of hope\" which became the title for his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and the title of his second book. While a Senate candidate, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, entitled The Audacity of Hope that propelled him to national prominence. In the less than twenty minutes it took to deliver the speech, Obama was catapulted to sudden fame, with many analysts predicting that he might be well \n\n Corsi said his purpose in writing the book was to defeat Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election. In the book, he recounts Barack Obama's upbringing and early political career in Chicago and argues that Obama is an \"extreme leftis[t]\" who should not be elected president. The book claims to document \"Obama's extensive connections with Islam and radical politics\", his \"religious affiliation with ... black-liberation theology\", and his associations with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, fundraiser Tony Rezko, and radical activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, formerly of the Weather Underground. The book also argues that Obama supports \"far-left domestic policy\" and \"naïve... foreign policy predicated on the reduction of the military\", and that he is therefore unsuitable to be the President of the United States. The book opens with a quote by Andy Martin, who The Nation, The Washington Post, and The New York Times have identified as the primary source for the allegations that Obama is concealing an alleged Muslim faith, rumors which began shortly after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.\n\n Obama's mother was born Stanley Ann Dunham. She became an anthropologist, specializing in economic anthropology and rural development. She earned her PhD degree from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa and worked with the United States Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation, and Women's World Banking, to promote the use of microcredit in order to combat global poverty. The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships at the East–West Center (EWC) in Honolulu, Hawaii, are named in her honor.

Fox Foundation’s interest in NRF2 activation solutions for Parkinson’s disease met with a lot of interest, so we decided to do a follow up piece highlighting an additional study that is currently underway.\nThis time, the Michael J. Fox Foundation has provided a grant in its search for a Parkinson’s Disease (PD) cure to Dr. Martin Martinov, PhD. His research project is entitled “Identification of Nrf2 Activators Using an In Silico Modeling Platform, Followed by Evaluation of These Compounds in an Alpha-Synuclein Model of PD”.\nAs demonstrated in numerous medical studies, Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the advancement of many disease conditions. This includes Parkinson’s disease (PD). The aim of this study is to determine whether the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) induces antioxidant protection and phase II detoxification enzymes. Numerous studies have been published on Pubmed which suggests protection to vulnerable neurons through the NRF2/ARE pathway. This neuronal Nrf2 up-regulation study is considered an attractive therapeutic strategy for PD by the Michael J. Fox Foundation.\nGradient Biomodeling, LLC claims to have identified two new potent non-toxic Nrf2 pathway activators. Their approach claims to have higher modulators than two other NRF2 activators, BHQ and Sulforaphane. Their preliminary experiments show evidence of blood brain barrier penetration.. The main objective is to determine whether these Nrf2 activators will result in neuroprotection in pre-clinical Parkinson’s disease conditions.\nThus far the experiments prove that blood brain barrier penetration takes place. Furthermore, the compounds offer protection of dopaminergic neurons in vitro. The researchers are continuing to explore methods to improve solubility of GB822 in the gut, or to bypass the gut via alternative delivery of the compound.\nNrf2 research studies will continue to be the topic of study not just for treatment of Parkinson’s Disease, but also for the other hundreds of diseases associated with Oxidative Stress as well. The recent FDA’s approval of the NRF2 activator, Tecfidera for the treatment of MS symptoms will further the interest in using NRF2 activators to treat disease conditions. It is estimated that more than 4 million people have Parkinson’s Disease. Those impacted by the disease including patients, families, care providers and medical practitioners are interested in finding a solution to slow down or eradicate the disease.\nThis article is educational purposes only, consult with a medical professional to discuss your own medical conditions.\nVisit the Michael J Fox Foundation for more information or to become more involved in finding a cure for Parkinson’s.

It is a 50-kilometre walking route which passes through the five country parks on Hong Kong island. The trail is extremely popular with local residents for its unique combination of well-marked paths (with reassuring trail markers every half-kilometre) through verdant woods that offer relief from the sun on sunny days, and featuring numerous streams and waterfalls. The trail offers a wide variety of terrain—it can be steep at some parts, flat at others, with both gradual ascents and descents. The trail takes a very indirect route; termination points Victoria Peak and Big Wave Bay are less than 11 km apart. Because the trail is composed of eight sections, much shorter runs or hikes are possible.

However, in Galicia and neighboring regions of Asturias and León in 1200–1500, the local languages remained the usual written languages in any type of document, either legal or narrative, public or private. Spanish was progressively introduced through Royal decrees and the edicts of foreign churchmen and officials. This led, from the late 15th century on, to the end of legal documents in Galician; the last ones were issued around 1530. Also, from 1480 on, notaries of the Crown of Castile were required to obtain their licenses in Toledo, where they had to prove their mastery of Spanish. In spite of Galician being the most spoken \n\n The historic and official language is Catalan, a Romance language. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra (Catalan: Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan. Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, Portuguese and French are commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities. According to mother tongue percentage statistics by the Andorran Government released in 2018 the principality has the following:\n\n It is supposed by law to be taught bilingually, alongside Spanish, in both primary and secondary education, although the accomplishment of this law is allegedly doubted. It is also used at the three universities established in Galicia, having also the consideration of official language of the three institutions. Galician has also legal recognition in the Bierzo region in León, and in four municipalities in Zamora. The other languages with official status elsewhere in Spain are Spanish, Catalan (or Valencian), Basque and Aranese. Galician has also been accepted orally as Portuguese in the European Parliament, being used by some Galician representatives, \n\n territory. The Statutes of Autonomy of the respective autonomous communities have declared Basque the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, Catalan the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as Valencian—and Galician to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional languages in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan/Valencian by 17%, and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards. A 2016 Basque Government census revealed 700,000 fluent speakers in Spain (51,000 in Basque counties in France) and 1,185.000 total when passive speakers are included.\n\n Language politics in Francoist Spain declared Spanish as the only official language in Spain, and to this day it is the most widely used language in government, business, public education, the workplace, cultural arts, and the media. But in the 1960s and 1970s, the Spanish parliament agreed to allow provinces to use, speak, and print official documents in three other languages: Catalan for Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencia; Basque for the Basque provinces and Navarre, and Galician for Galicia. Since 1975, following the death of Franco, Spain has become a multi-party democracy and decentralized country, constituted in autonomous communities. Under this system, some languages of Spain—such as Aranese (an Occitan language of northwestern Catalonia), Basque, Catalan/Valencian, and Galician—have gained co-official status in their respective geographical areas. Others—such as Aragonese, Asturian and Leonese—have been recognized by regional governments.\n\nQuestion: what are the four main languages spoken in spain?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Other than this passage, there is no evidence hinting of a connection between Gofraid and Iceland. The chronicle elsewhere states that Gofraid died on Islay, although the island's name is rendered \"Ile\" in this case.

First defined in 1975, they gave the UK \"several years lead over other countries\" but were intended as \"interim standards\" until international agreement was reached. The design of the Transmission Control Program incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. In version 3 of TCP, written in 1978, the Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Internet Protocol (IP) as connectionless layer and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a reliable connection-oriented service. Originally referred to as IP/TCP, version 4 was installed \n\n In the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), OSI's data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer, the link layer. The TCP/IP link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to, and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware (MAC) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link. The link-layer functionality was described in RFC 1122 and is defined differently than the data link layer of OSI, and encompasses all methods that affect the local link. The TCP/IP model is not a top-down comprehensive design reference for networks. It was formulated for the purpose of illustrating the logical groups and scopes of functions needed in the design of the suite of internetworking protocols of TCP/IP, as needed for the operation of the Internet. In general, direct or strict comparisons of the OSI and TCP/IP models should be avoided, because the layering in TCP/IP is not a principal design criterion and in general, considered to be \"harmful\" (RFC 3439). In particular, TCP/IP does not dictate a strict hierarchical sequence of encapsulation requirements, as is attributed to OSI protocols.\n\n On the ARPANET, the starting point for host-to-host communication in 1969 was the 1822 protocol which provided a reliable packet delivery procedure via an Interface Message Processor. The Network Control Program (NCP) for the ARPANET was first implemented in 1970. The designers of the NCP envisioned a hierarchy of protocols to enable Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) functions across the ARPANET. Networking research in the early 1970s by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf led to the formulation of the first version of the Transmission Control Program (TCP) in 1974. Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December as a monolithic (single layer) design. The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London, but it was not installed \n\n SATNET in 1982 and on the ARPANET in January 1983 after the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. This resulted in a networking model that became known informally as TCP/IP. It was also referred to as the Department of Defense (DoD) model, DARPA model, or ARPANET model. Computer manufacturers developed proprietary protocol suites such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options. Therefore, proprietary standards, particularly SNA and DECnet, as well as some \n\n described as a \"battle for access standards\". Several proprietary standards emerged and European postal, telegraph and telephone services (PTTs) developed the X.25 standard in 1976, which was adopted on public networks providing global coverage. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) developed and tested TCP/IP during the 1970s in collaboration with universities and researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and France. IPv4 was released in 1981 and the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. By 1984, an international reference model known as the OSI model had been agreed on, with which TCP/IP was not compatible.

In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth \n\n Bowl victory in 2008. As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The team played its home games at Athletic Park, later known as Borchert Field, on Milwaukee's north side. The team was notable for having many African-American players for the time. After the team folded following the season (largely due to being left broke because of a $500 fine by the NFL for using four high-school players in a  game against the Chicago Cardinals, a game arranged after the Badgers had disbanded for the season), many of its members played for the independent semi-pro Milwaukee Eagles. Some of the players from this team went on to play for the NFL's Pittsburgh Pirates in 1933. This has led some to mistakenly believe that either the Badgers or Eagles became the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Milwaukee market is now claimed by the Green Bay Packers, who played three or four regular season games there from 1933&ndash;94, including the 1939 NFL Championship Game. The Packers still reserve two games a season for their old Milwaukee season ticket holders, and have their flagship radio station there as well.\n\n The Pittsburgh Steelers are an American football franchise representing Pittsburgh. They are the seventh-oldest club in the National Football League (NFL), which they joined in. The only surviving NFL teams with a longer history are the Chicago Bears, Chicago (Arizona as well as St. Louis) Cardinals, Detroit Lions (then the Portsmouth Spartans), Green Bay Packers, New York Giants and Boston (Washington) Redskins. The Philadelphia Eagles joined the league concurrently with the Steelers in 1933. The team was founded by Arthur J. \"Art\" Rooney. The Rooney family has held a controlling interest in the club for almost its entire history. Since its founding the team has captured six league championships and competed in more than a thousand games. In the Steelers became the first NFL team to capture six Super Bowl titles.

His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where \n\n Renn studied physics at the Free University of Berlin and at the Sapienza University of Rome. In 1987 he received his Ph.D in mathematical physics from the Technical University of Berlin. Between 1986 and 1992 he worked as co-editor of the \"Collected Papers of Albert Einstein\" at Boston University. Between 1991 and 1996 he co-directed with Peter Damerow the \"Arbeitsstelle Albert Einstein\" at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. In 1993/94 he was visiting professor at Tel Aviv University and at the ETH Zurich. Since its founding in 1994 Renn is a Director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG) in Berlin. Renn holds an honorary professorship for the history of science at the Humboldt University of \n\n By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 \n\n 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann. When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\".

The Hornets were coached by James Borrego, in his third season as the team's head coach. Following the 2019–20 NBA season, the Hornets qualified as a lottery team, receiving the 3rd overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft lottery. The Hornets selected LaMelo Ball with the 3rd pick in the 2020 NBA draft, followed by Vernon Carey Jr. and Grant Riller in the second round. In a draft-night trade, the Hornets also acquired Nick Richards from the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for a 2024 second-round pick. On November 30, in a sign-and-trade deal with the Boston Celtics, the Hornets acquired Gordon Hayward and two future second-round picks in exchange for a protected 2022 second-round pick. On March 25, the Hornets acquired Brad Wanamaker, a protected 2022 second-round pick, and cash considerations from the Golden State Warriors in exchange for a protected 2025 second-round pick. The Hornets season ended following a 144–117 loss to the Indiana Pacers in the NBA play-in tournament.\n\n In the 1996–97 NBA season, the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as \"Hardwood Classics\". The Toronto Raptors were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct Toronto Huskies, an original BAA team.

The team is mainly owned by Basketball Hall-of-Fame member Michael Jordan, who acquired a controlling interest in the team in 2010. The Hornets play their home games at the Spectrum Center in Uptown Charlotte. The original Hornets franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team, owned by George Shinn. In 2002, Shinn's franchise relocated to New Orleans and became the New Orleans Hornets. In 2004, the NBA established the Charlotte Bobcats, which was regarded as a new expansion team at the time. In 2014, the Bobcats were renamed Charlotte Hornets, and acquired official history and records of the original Hornets (spanning from 1988 to 2002), while the New Orleans team was renamed the Pelicans.\n\n During the off-season, the team picked Gerald Henderson from Duke 12th overall in the 2009 NBA draft. The Bobcats traded Emeka Okafor for New Orleans Hornets' center Tyson Chandler, and through more trades acquired Stephen Jackson and Acie Law from the Golden State Warriors. On February 27, 2010, it was announced that Johnson had decided to sell the team to Jordan, allowing Jordan to become the first former NBA player to become majority owner of a franchise. On April 9, 2010, the Bobcats clinched their first playoff berth since 2002 with a 104–103 road win over the New Orleans Hornets, finishing the 2009–10 season with an overall record of 44–38, their first-ever winning season.

Since governor Haslam, much emphasis has been placed on education and increasing the number of student enrolling in technical and community colleges. Bill Lee has continued this priority by proposing a budget to increase funding for school safety and resource officers. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have carried the belief that a well balanced budget should always be paramount when shaping policy in Tennessee. Governor Sundquist served from 1995 to 2003. In 1996 Sundquist focused heavily on ethic and welfare reforms and played a role in the creation of the Tennessee Regulatory Authority and the Families First Act.

Businessman Bill Lee defeated former Haslam administration official Randy Boyd, U.S. Representative Diane Black, and speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives Beth Harwell for the Republican nomination. Former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean defeated House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh for the Democratic nomination. Bill Lee won the election in a landslide.\n\n Bill Haslam, Republican, was governor from 2011 to 2018, succeeding Phil Bredesen. Because he took office during the Great Recession, he focused on economic recovery. He tightened the state's budgets, called for additional funds for Tennessee's Rainy day fund, and worked on making Tennessee more business-friendly. However, his main legacy is in education. He is most well known for the TN Promise and Reconnect Programs, which allow students to attend a community college for two years with free tuition. This was done to make Tennessee more attractive to businesses and improve the workforce. Additionally, from 2017 to 2018, Haslam served as the chair of the Republican Governors' Association, working to elect Republicans in the 2018 gubernatorial elections.\n\n Bill Lee, Republican, is the 50th governor of Tennessee, succeeding Bill Haslam in 2019. A former president of his company, the Lee Company, his primary focus so far has been job creation and the economy. In his budget proposal, Lee outlined plans for K-12 education, mental health, criminal justice, rural economic development and health care. Like Haslam, Lee also intends to add to the Rainy Day fund. Lee's early executive orders included an order requiring all state executive departments to report rural impact and recommendations for improvement and three regarding ethics and transparency.\n\n The governor of Tennessee is the head of government of the U.S. state of Tennessee.

This became the first commuter line from Savannah to an outlying area. 19th-century development in Savannah was dominated by the emergence of cotton as a widespread cash crop and a subsequent shift in the economy of the city. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney changed the face of agriculture in the American South. Whitney's gin was produced in response to the state of Georgia's appointed commission for the promotion of a gin suitable to remove seed from fibers on the short-staple, green-seed cotton. Whitney developed the gin at Mulberry Grove Plantation outside Savannah while he was a tutor to the \n\n Eli Whitney’s development of the cotton gin in the late 18th century contributed to the development of the area, and the Deep South as a whole, as it made mechanized processing of short-staple cotton profitable. This type of cotton was better suited to the upland areas of the Deep South. Planters in the Natchez District became very wealthy by converting their tobacco plantations to cotton, for which there was a large market between 1785 and 1800. The rich loess soils proved very fertile for cotton cultivation. The planters developed new, more productive strains of cotton, improved cotton gins, and developed a large-scale system dependent upon both machinery and large numbers of slaves. Their model was expanded in the antebellum \n\n Eli Whitney Jr. (December 8, 1765 – January 8, 1825) was an American inventor, widely known for inventing the cotton gin, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the Antebellum South. Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army.

The term is derived from Lusitanian ('person of Lusitania', Lusitano, Luso, fem. Lusitana, Lusa; from Lusitanicus, from Lusitania, the name of a Roman province in the Iberian Peninsula, which encompassed most of modern Portugal). Luso- is a Late Latin prefix used to denote Portugal/Portuguese, in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. A Lusophone (Lusófono/a) is someone who speaks the Portuguese language, either natively or as an additional language. As an adjective it means 'Portuguese-speaking'.

Cuban Spanish is very close to Canarian Spanish, as Canarians have been emigrating to Cuba since the 16th century, especially during the 19th and (early) 20th centuries. Through cross-emigration by Canarians and Cubans, many Canarian customs have become Cuban traditions and vice versa. Cuban music has been integrated into Canarian culture as well, including mambo, son, \n\n The official language of Cuba is Spanish and the vast majority of Cubans speak it. Spanish as spoken in Cuba is known as Cuban Spanish and is a form of Caribbean Spanish.

Cain stated that his movement \"is all about empowering an army of Davids to demand that we replace our twisted tax code with the simplicity of 9–9–9, that we reform the federal regulatory morass, and that we return to a system of sound money.\" The text is written by Herman Cain and Rich Lowrie, and was released on May 1, 2012.

Another of the king's primary objects was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the kingdom in a location protected from sea attack, and distant from the revolt-prone and congested city of Naples. To provide the king with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace.

The structure was originally built in the second half of the ninth century by the Muslims, then extended and enlarged over the centuries, particularly after 1560. It was at this time that the fortress was converted into a royal palace, and Madrid became the capital of the Spanish Empire. Despite being a palace, the great building kept its original arabic title of Alcázar (English: \"castle\"). The first extension to the building was commissioned by King Charles I (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) and completed in 1537. Its exterior was constructed by the architect Juan Gómez de Mora in 1636 on a commission from King Philip IV. As famous for its artistic treasures as it is for its unusual architecture, it was the residence of the Spanish Royal Family and home of the Court, until its destruction by fire during the reign of King Philip V (the first Bourbon king), on Christmas Eve 1734. Many artistic treasures were lost, including over 500 paintings. Other works, such as the painting Las Meninas by Velázquez, were saved.\n\n Saint Jerome the Royal (in Spanish San Jerónimo el Real) is a Roman Catholic church from the early 16th-century in central Madrid (Spain). The church, which has undergone numerous remodelings and restorations over the centuries is the remaining structure of the Hieronymite monastery that once stood beside the royal palace of Buen Retiro, of which a portion now serves as the Prado museum. Its proximity to the royal palace also underscores a connection to royalty, serving for centuries as the church used for the investiture of the Prince of Asturias. In addition, a Mass to celebrate the investiture of King Juan Carlos I was held here. In part, this link was cemented also because Madrid only completed its Cathedral of the Almudena in 1993. For many centuries, the Church of San Isidro served as a de facto cathedral, but while this church was associated with the patron saint of Madrid, St. Isidore was also the patron of manual laborers, not royalty, thereby relegating the role of royal chapel to this church.\n\n  The Salón de Reinos (translated as \"Hall of the Kingdoms\" or \"Hall of Realms\") or salón grande (\"great hall\") is a 17th-century building in Madrid, originally a wing of the Buen Retiro Palace. The Salón de Reinos and the Casón del Buen Retiro are the only survivors of the original grand scheme of the palace. Built between 1630 and 1635, the Hall of Realms housed the largest paintings in the royal collection, now all in the Museo del Prado. It is named after its paintings of the coats of arms of the 24 kingdoms which formed the Kingdom of Spain at the time of Philip IV of Spain. The building served as the Museo del Ejército from 1841 to 2010 when the military collections were put on display at the Alcázar of Toledo. The Prado Museum acquired the vacant building to display part of its collections and made its renovation the subject of an architectural competition. The brief was to redesign the space as part of the campus of the art museum for its 200th anniversary. It was won in 2016 by a scheme from the British firm Foster and Partners and the Spanish firm Rubio Arquitectura.\n\n  For centuries Peñalara has drawn hundreds of sightseers with its magnificent views and landscape.

However, Mauro himself never sought political office again. Eventually, he opened a private law practice in his hometown of Austin. George W. Bush was inaugurated for his second term as Governor of Texas on January 19, 1999. With his brother sworn-in as Governor of Florida earlier that month, George and Jeb Bush became the first two brothers to simultaneously serve as governors since Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller from 1967 to 1971. Five months later, in June 1999, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 2000. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush was nominated for President of the United States and narrowly won the election against Al Gore. On December 21, 2000, less than two years into his second term, George W.

The major party candidates were Democratic Vice President Al Gore of the incumbent administration and Republican Governor of Texas George W. Bush, son of the 41st U.S. president, George H. W. Bush.

The site was buried in 1968 by the construction of California State Route 33. Prior to the freeway's construction, archaeologists excavated and studied the site. A number of foundation stones were moved and used to create the Santa Gertrudis Asistencia Monument which was designated in 1970 as Ventura County Historic Landmark No. 11.\n\n Mission San Buenaventura following the course of the Ventura River. The Santa Gertrudis site was located 5.1 miles north of the mouth of the Ventura River and 220 feet from the river's east bank. According to one account, it was situated near a sycamore tree used in rituals by the Chumash people. Sol N. Sheridan in 1926 described the site as follows:\"The spot had always been a sacred one to the Indians. There at the point where the Casitas Pass road branches from the road to Ojai, stood their own sacred tree - a great sycamore under whose wide-spread boughs they had always assembled to worship their primeval god, and amongst \n\n Mission Basilica San Buenaventura (Misión San Buenaventura) is a Catholic parish in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The parish church in the city of Ventura, California, United States, is a Spanish mission founded by the Order of Friars Minor. Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in Alta California (or Nueva California) and the last to be established by the head of the Franciscan missions in California, Junípero Serra. Designated a California Historical Landmark, the mission is one of many locally designated landmarks in downtown Ventura. The mission was named after St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Franciscan saint, one of the early leaders of the Order to which the friars belonged, and a Doctor of the Church.

This led to the signing of the secret Treaty of London on 26 April by which Italy agreed to enter the war within one month. On 4 May Italy renounced the Triple Alliance, but did not yet enter the war in the side of the Entente as a majority in parliament continued to favour neutrality. The former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was warned that Salandra intended to take the country to war, and on 9 May he returned to Rome to try to prevent this. On 10 May he tried to persuade King Victor Emmanuel that a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies would show that parliament did not support entry into the war. Realising that he could not secure a majority, on 13 May, Salandra resigned.\n\n Fiorenzo Bava Beccaris was born in Fossano, and took part in the Crimean War and the Italian Wars of Independence. In May 1898, when serious riots arising from high food prices broke out in Milan, the Italian government under Antonio di Rudinì declared a state of siege in the city. General Bava Beccaris, as extraordinary commissar of the city, ordered his soldiers to fire on demonstrators, who had erected several barricades during a strike. Artillery was also used. According to official figures 80 people were killed and 450 wounded. However actual deaths may have been twice those recorded. In recognition of his action Bava Beccaris received the Great Cross of the Order of Savoy from King Umberto I in June 1898. He was shortly afterwards appointed to the Italian Senate. During 1914, he warmly supported the interventionist party in Italy who wished to participate in World War I, (as they did on 25 May 1915). In 1922, he recommended that King Victor Emmanuel III grant power to Benito Mussolini and the National Fascist Party. Bava Beccaris retired in 1902. He died in Rome in 1924.\n\n of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. Giuseppe Garibaldi, the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. Pope Pius IX, a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the Vatican walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with Rome as capital. World War I has been \n\n Unlike the German Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini was officially only the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy. Victor Emmanuel III remained Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Royal Armed Forces. Mussolini needed the consent of the King (who always looked at France as the center of European politics) to declare war and enter the Second World War. Initially the King and his staff (conscious of the Italian lack of preparation to war) did not approve Mussolini's intentions, but when France was clearly defeated in June 1940, the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was abruptly sent to war. Mussolini made the mistake to believe that Britain would accept peace agreements with the Axis after France's surrender, and did not anticipate a long lasting war. Consequently, Italy entered the war inadequately prepared.\n\n 1861, Portugal recognized King Victor Emmanuel III of the united Kingdom of Italy. In September 1911, Italy recognized the First Portuguese Republic and in May 1918, Italy recognized the government of Portuguese President Sidónio Pais. In 1946, the last Italian King, Umberto II of Italy, fled to Portugal where he remained for 37 years. During World War I, Portugal remained neutral, however, in 1916 it became an associated member to the allied forces (which included Italy). During World War II, Portugal remained neutral throughout the war. Political relations between Italy and Portugal remain close.

When these directions became common, Diamond Head was the eastern edge of the primary populated area.

One day the bird which had nowhere to light grew tired of flying about, so she stirred up the sea until it threw its waters against the sky. The sky, in order to restrain the sea, showered upon it many islands until it could no longer rise, but ran back and forth. Then the sky ordered the kite to light on one of the islands to build her nest, and to leave the sea and the sky in peace.

Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard.\nDescription: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. SCP-3105 is able to infect almost all animals to some extent, though the infection it causes is asymptomatic in non-human hosts. SCP-3105 can be transmitted by airborne particles, bodily fluids, or an animal vector1.\nIn humans, SCP-3105 enters the bloodstream and infects neural pathways. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. Symptoms of infection will begin to present themselves an average of 5 days after contraction, though this value varies wildly, depending on the location and mode of initial infection, from 2 hours to 14 days. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious.\nOnce SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. It will infect and destroy neurons involved in this process over the course of two days. The method by which SCP-3105 identifies target cells is unknown, and presumed to be anomalous. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia.\nAfter destroying much of the medial temporal lobe, SCP-3105 will infect peripheral glial cells that are left behind, allowing it to remain dormant in the central nervous system for up to 3 months. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days.\nSCP-3105 infection also triggers the secretion of cytokines3, deactivating cytoxic T-cells and preventing an effective immune response. This mechanism also prevents artificial attempts at preemptive immunization.\nRecovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.\nInitial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. Armed Response Force Omega-6 was mobilized with the express purpose of destroying all SCP-3105 instances using incendiary munitions. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline.\nThe following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. Monospaced text represents physical notes4, whereas standard text represents unsent messages and journal entries recovered from an abandoned mobile phone.

Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work.\n\nIn particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. It is important to note that while we recognize these names as eponyms associated with signs, symptoms, diseases, and anatomy, the story of their lives, research, and influence on each other has been relatively unexplored.\n\nVirchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. His emphasis on cellular pathology and his groundbreaking research on disease processes greatly influenced Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen.\n\nKussmaul, a student of Virchow, made notable contributions to clinical observation. He is well-known for his studies on the stomach and its function, as well as his work on respiratory physiology. Kussmaul's keen observations and systematic approach to clinical examination were influenced by Virchow's emphasis on meticulous observation and accurate documentation.\n\nQuincke, another student of Virchow, is renowned for his discoveries and advancements in the field of medical diagnostics. He is particularly known for his descriptions of Quincke's edema (angioedema) and his work on the lumbar puncture technique. Quincke's ability to recognize and describe clinical manifestations of diseases was undoubtedly influenced by Virchow's teachings on clinical observation.\n\nVon Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. He is best known for his description of neurofibromatosis, Von Recklinghausen's disease, and his research on the connective tissues. Von Recklinghausen's ability to correlate pathological findings with clinical presentations was likely influenced by his mentor's emphasis on the importance of integrating anatomical and clinical knowledge.\n\nIn summary, the influential physicians in Germany during the 19th century, namely Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen, had their contributions to medicine and clinical observation shaped by their relationships with Virchow. Virchow's mentorship and his emphasis on cellular pathology, meticulous observation, and accurate documentation influenced these individuals in their respective fields. Their collective work left a lasting impact on the medical community and continues to be recognized and appreciated today.\n\nRudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. His microscopic studies revealed cells dividing into two equal parts, which contributed to the development of the cell theory. This theory states that all living things are made up of one or more cells and that cells are the basic units of life. Alongside German physiologist Theodor Schwann and German botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden, Virchow played a vital role in establishing the cell theory.\n\nIn addition to his work on cell division, Virchow was the first to accurately identify leukemia cells in blood, which advanced our understanding of cancer. His observations and descriptions of cancer cells in the blood have had a lasting impact on the field of oncology.\n\nAlthough Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection. He also disagreed with the germ theory proposed by Pasteur, believing that diseased tissues were caused by cellular malfunction rather than the invasion of foreign microbes.\n\nOverall, Virchow's studies on cell division and his identification of leukemia cells in blood were instrumental in advancing our knowledge of cells and cancer. His contributions laid the foundation for further research in the field of biology and continue to influence the fields of molecular biology and genetics today.\n\nIn 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. He emphasized that diseases arose, not in organs or tissues in general, but primarily in their individual cells. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843. As an intern at the Charité Hospital, he studied pathological histology and in 1845 published a paper in which he described one of the two earliest reported cases of leukemia. This paper became a classic. In 1849 Virchow was appointed to the newly established chair of pathological anatomy at the University of Würzburg—the first chair of that subject in Germany. At Würzburg Virchow published many papers on pathological anatomy. He began there the publication of his six-volume _Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie_ (\"Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"), most of the first volume of which he wrote himself. At Würzburg he also began to formulate his theories on cellular pathology and started his anthropological work with studies of the skulls of cretins (dwarfed, mentally deficient individuals) and investigations into the development of the base of the skull. In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin. During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.In 1861 Virchow was elected to the Prussian Diet.He was a founder of the Fortschrittspartei (Progressive Party) and a determined and untiring opponent of Otto von Bismarck, who in 1865 challenged him to a duel, which he wisely declined.In the wars of 1866 and 1870 Virchow confined his political activities to the erection of military hospitals and the equipping of hospital trains.\n\nSome of the contributions and accomplishments of Virchow during his time in Berlin include:\n\n1. Pathological Anatomy: Virchow published numerous papers on pathological anatomy and began his six-volume \"Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie\" (Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics) while at Würzburg. He played a significant role in advancing the understanding of diseases through detailed examination and classification of tissue changes.\n\n2. Cellular Pathology: Virchow formulated theories on cellular pathology during his time at Würzburg. He emphasized the importance of cells in understanding disease processes and helped establish the field of cellular pathology, which paved the way for further advancements in medicine.\n\n3. Anthropological Work: Virchow started his anthropological work, studying the skulls of cretins and investigating the development of the base of the skull. His anthropological research contributed to the understanding of human anatomy and the effects of various conditions on skeletal structures.\n\n4. Political Involvement: While in Berlin, Virchow actively engaged in politics and was elected to the Berlin City Council in 1859. He focused on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, hospital design, meat inspection, and school hygiene. He supervised the design of two new Berlin hospitals, opened a nursing school, and designed the city's sewer system.\n\n5. Hospital Trains: During the Franco-German War and the wars of 1866 and 1870, Virchow played a prominent role in the establishment and operation of hospital trains. He personally led the first hospital train to the front in the Franco-German War and worked on equipping military hospitals during other conflicts.\n\nVirchow's contributions had a profound impact on medicine and public health, shaping our understanding of diseases, promoting advancements in anatomical research, and advocating for healthcare improvements.\n\n The center derives its name from the pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who was a professor in Würzburg from 1849 to 1856 and was the first to postulate that diseases originated in dysfunctions of cells. Researchers at the Rudolf Virchow Center aim to trace diseases back to dysfunctions of proteins. These are called target proteins because they may serve as targets for diagnostic tools or for therapeutic drugs. Research is organized in four fields: (1) Protein structure and function (2) Proteins in cellular signaling (3) Nucleic acid-binding proteins (4) Proteins in cell-cell interactions. The Rudolf Virchow Center also organizes a graduate program and several undergraduate programs in biomedicine and experimental medicine,. Its Public Science Center offers courses for children and high school students and public events.\n\nQuestion: where did rudolf virchow conduct his research?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He along with Kirsty McNeill developed Brown's \"No time for a novice speech\" at the 2008 Labour Party Conference which was \"warmly received\". Muir worked closely with Peter Mandelson and Philip Gould on the Labour Party's 2010 general election campaign. He was the lead negotiator of the historic British TV Election Debates and was an early proponent of them. He is believed to have argued for a hard edged attack on the Conservatives and their threat to middle income earners. In particular he pushed for the campaign to focus on the threat the Conservative's posed to child tax credits. It is also believed that he supported Gordon Brown's decision not to serve a full term. The campaign denied the Conservatives an overall majority and Muir was part of small team that spent the next five days in discussions with the Liberal Democrats.

After the 2010 election he helped run Ed Miliband's campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party, and served as an adviser to Ed Miliband, the Labour party's leader, from 2010 to 2015.\n\n George Brown was born in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, Peter Brown, ran a wholesale business in Edinburgh and managed a glassworks in Alloa. His mother was Marianne. George was the eldest of six children. He lived in Alloa until he moved to Edinburgh before he turned eight. He attended Royal High School and upon his graduation he worked in his father's business ventures. Peter mismanaged funds while working as a collector of assessments. Although he was not accused of corruption, he sought to repair his reputation and recoup lost funds. During the 1837 economic depression, Peter decided to emigrate to New York City to seek business opportunities and rebuild his reputation. George accompanied his father to North America.\n\n James Gordon Brown (born 20 February 1951) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2010.

Greece's large coastline and multiple islands mean that policing migrants' entry is very difficult. Additionally, Greece's reliance on tourism means that the borders have never been adequately policed (though this has begun to change, as with the rest of the continent). The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008. For these reasons, many immigrants enter Greece to try to gain access to the rest of the European Union.\n\n Greece (Ελλάδα, ), officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country located in Southeastern Europe.

Sherman had his famous postgame interview immediately afterwards, calling out 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree and claiming to be the \"best corner in the game\". Seattle went on to defeat the Denver Broncos 43–8 in Super Bowl XLVIII to win their first Super Bowl championship. San Francisco had represented the NFC in a losing effort in Super Bowl XLVII the previous season. The Seahawks lead the all-time series 30–17. Since drafting Russell Wilson in 2012, the Seahawks have completely dominated the rivalry, holding a 17–4 record against the 49ers in that span.\n\n The Legion of Boom's crowning achievement was their team's 43–8 win in Super Bowl XLVIII, a blowout victory over the 2013 Denver Broncos, who were considered the best single season passing offense of all time and one of the best offenses in league history. The Seahawks became the fastest team to score in a Super Bowl when they had a safety 12 seconds into the game. They also became the first team to ever score with a safety, interception return for a touchdown and kickoff return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl. They led the game for 59 minutes, 48 seconds, which is the longest lead in Super Bowl history. It was the 3rd largest point \n\n yards for a second-quarter touchdown), and Byron Maxwell forced a fumble. The 2013 Seahawks allowed just one 300-yard passer, Matt Schaub in Week 5, and a second in the divisional round against Drew Brees. Eleven times in the regular season they held an opposing quarterback to less than 200 yards passing, then did it once more in the NFC Championship game. The team's 28 interceptions were most in the league, and 16 passing touchdowns allowed the second fewest.

The game was played in Lumen Field (known as CenturyLink Field at the time), Seattle, Washington and, being the NFC Championship Game, was televised nationally on Fox. With the score 23–17 in favor of the Seahawks, the 49ers had driven the ball all the way to the Seahawks' 18 yard line. With 0:30 left in regulation, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick threw a pass to Michael Crabtree in the right corner of the endzone. Before Crabtree could catch the ball, cornerback Richard Sherman deflected the ball directly into linebacker Malcolm Smith's hands for an interception, all but sealing the Seahawks victory.

He's pictured delivering a lecture to mark NASA's 50th anniversary in 2008.\nWhen ALS begins, its symptoms are often hard to notice. Some people may become clumsier than usual. Others may experience muscle weakness or stiffness. Still others may slur their words.\nWhich symptoms appear first depends on the muscles affected. When the disease damages lower motor neurons, muscles in a particular part of the body (like the hand or foot) will be affected. When ALS impacts upper motor neurons, people will experience general clumsiness, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing. Eventually, the disease will spread to all of the body's muscles and lead to total paralysis.\nIn the early stages of the disease, symptoms may include muscle weakness in one part of the body (an arm or leg); clumsiness, such as tripping and dropping things; difficulty speaking or swallowing; muscle twitches (fasciculations) and cramps; fatigue in the arms or legs; weight loss and the loss of muscle mass; and uncontrolled laughing or crying, called emotional incontinence.\nHow the disease progresses varies from person to person. But as it worsens, people may experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes (including a strong gag reflex).\nEventually people may lose the ability to breathe on their own and will need to be put on a ventilator. Most people with the disease eventually die from respiratory failure or pneumonia -- because they can't swallow properly, they aspirate food and fluid into the lungs.\nWhile ALS can devastate the body, it doesn't affect involuntary muscles (such as bowel and bladder function), the senses (smell, taste, hearing and sight), or the ability to think.\nALS isn't an easy disease to diagnose. Its symptoms mimic those of other diseases (such as Parkinson's) and there isn't one test to spot it. Often doctors will rule out other diseases to arrive at a diagnosis. For the very small percentage of people with familial ALS, there's a genetic test to look for the faulty SOD1 gene. However, because most people with ALS don't have this gene, the test isn't very useful.\nElectromyogram (EMG) inserts a thin electrode into the muscle to detect electrical activity and see how well the muscles are working.\nNerve conduction velocity (NCV) passes a small shock through a nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.\nSpinal tap inserts a needle into the spinal canal and removes fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) for testing.\nX-rays, CT scans and MRI create images of the brain and spinal cord to look for any abnormalities.\nBlood and urine tests look for abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood and urine.\nMuscle or nerve biopsy removes a small sample of tissue, which is sent to a lab for testing.\nOnce a person is diagnosed, the average survival time is only three to five years. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS live for 10 years or more, and the lifespan for ALS patients is increasing as new treatments are introduced [source: ­ALSA].\n­­Most people who receive a diagnosis of ALS can expect to live just three to five years. British physicist Stephen Hawking has defied the odds, living for more than 45 years with the disease. Hawking was diagnosed at 21, while a graduate student at Cambridge University. He has been wheelchair-bound since the 1970s. In 1985, he developed pneumonia and had to have a tracheotomy operation, which robbed him of his ability to speak. When a computer whiz in California heard of Hawking's plight, he sent him a computer program called Equalizer that could speak for him. Since then, Hawking has become known for the synthesized, computer-generated voice that enables him to speak. Determined early on not to let the disease steal his life, Hawking went on to become one of the world's preeminent physicists. He published the best-selling book, \"A Brief History of Time,\" and he has made great contributions to the fields of quantum gravity and cosmology.\n\n A Brief History of Time is a 1991 biographical documentary film about the physicist Stephen Hawking, directed by Errol Morris. The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but, whereas the book is solely an explanation of cosmology, the film is, additionally, a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with some of his family members and colleagues. The music is by frequent Morris collaborator Philip Glass.\n\n The Universe in a Nutshell is a 2001 book about theoretical physics by Stephen Hawking. It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller A Brief History of Time was published in 1988.\n\n In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\"\n\n For four years starting in 1982, Hawkings covered federal courts and city hall, was a metro section columnist and then an assistant city editor for the San Antonio Light. In 1986 he became press secretary for Texas Republican Lamar Smith during his initial campaign for the House of Representatives and remained for Smith’s first term. He returned to journalism for good in 1989 and was a Washington correspondent for Thomson Newspapers for six years. He was managing editor of the CQ Daily Monitor before joining the CQ Weekly in 1999, first as congressional leadership editor, then economic affairs editor, then senior editor for legislative affairs.

Caldecott was his father's third child by his first wife, Mary Dinah Brookes. In 1848, the family moved to Challoner House, Crook Street, Chester, and in 1860 to 23 Richmond Place, Boughton, a village just outside the city. From his early childhood, Caldecott drew and modelled, mostly animals. His main education came with five years at the King's School, Chester, a grammar school then in the cathedral precinct in the city centre, which he left at the age of fifteen. In that same year, 1861, he first had a drawing published, a sketch of a disastrous fire at the Queens \n\n Geisel wrote more than 60 books over the course of his long career. Most were published under his well-known pseudonym Dr. Seuss, though he also authored more than a dozen books as Theo LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone. His books have topped many bestseller lists, sold over 600 million copies, and been translated into more than 20 languages. In 2000, Publishers Weekly compiled a list of the best-selling children's books of all time; of the top 100 hardcover books, 16 were written by Geisel, including Green Eggs and Ham, at number 4, The Cat in the Hat, at number 9, and One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, at number 13. In the years after his death in 1991, two additional books were published \n\n In 1928, Flit, then marketed by a newly formed subsidiary of Jersey Standard, Stanco Incorporated, became the subject of a very successful long running advertising campaign. Theodor Seuss Geisel created the artwork for this campaign, years before he started writing the children's books that made him famous as Dr. Seuss. The ads typically showed people threatened by whimsical, menacing insect-like creatures that would look familiar to fans of Dr. Seuss's later work and contained the tagline \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" Seuss's artwork associated with Flit included numerous racial caricatures which, although not unusual for the 1930s, are now seen as racially insensitive. This advertising campaign continued for 17 years and made \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" a popular catchphrase in the United States.\n\n And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book published under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows a boy named Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father at the end of his walk. However, when he arrives home, he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon. Geisel conceived the core of the book aboard a ship in 1936, returning from a European vacation with his wife. The rhythm of the ship's engines captivated him and inspired the book's signature lines: At \n\n Theodor Seuss Geisel ( March 2, 1904 – September 24, 1991) was an American children's author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, and filmmaker.

Queensland has the largest onshore oil and gas potential in the country as the state is relatively under-explored. Oil was discovered in the south west of the state in the early 1980s, leading to the construction of an oil pipeline from the Cooper Basin and Eromanga Basins to Brisbane. A series of gas pipelines, which began operating in the late 1990s, connects users in Mount Isa and Brisbane to the south west. Gemstones such as sapphire, opal and chrysoprase are also mined in commercial quantities. In the 2008-09 financial year Queensland collected A$3 billion in mining royalties.\n\n The economy of Queensland is the third largest economy within Australia. Queensland generated 19.5% of Australia's gross domestic product in the 2008-09 financial year. The economy is primarily built upon mining, agriculture, tourism and financial services. Queensland's main exports are coal, metals, meat and sugar. Western Australia and Queensland are often referred to as the \"resource states\" because their economies are currently dependent on exports of resources such as coal, iron ore and natural gas.

Ten of Australia's thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, with the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns and Toowoomba. A high proportion of the state's population is multicultural, with 28.9% of inhabitants being immigrants. Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians \n\n The Gold Coast is a coastal city in the state of Queensland, Australia, approximately 66 km south-southeast of the centre of the state capital Brisbane and immediately north of the border with New South Wales.

Though Belgium as a whole is multilingual, the four language areas into which the country is divided (Flanders, francophone Wallonia, bilingual Brussels and the German-speaking Community) are largely monolingual. The Netherlands and Belgium produce the vast majority of music, films, books and other media written or spoken in Dutch. Dutch is a monocentric language, at least what concerns its written form, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the Dutch Language Union) based on a Dutch orthography defined in the so-called \"Green Booklet\" authoritative dictionary and \n\n Wallonia; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German.

The last two correspond to the language areas in Belgium, Wallonia hosting both the bulk of the French-speaking population and the German-speaking minority. In Brussels, ca. 80% of the population speaks French and ca. 20% Dutch with the city being an enclave of the Flemish region and officially a bilingual area. ; Flanders is the region associated with Belgium's Dutch-speaking majority, i.e. the Flemish Community. ; Due to its relatively small size (approximately one percent) the German-speaking Community \n\n French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking. The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking bourgeoisie who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the Flemish movement, which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the Flemish people. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921. The Frenchification of Brussels was at that time in full expansion. To this day, French remains the language of the aristocracy. While a Walloon industrial and mining base developed during the 19th century, the largely agrarian Flanders area \n\n As no census exists, there are no official statistics on Belgium's three official languages or their dialects. Various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may affect suggested figures.

Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.

It is operated by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department. The airport opened on November 18, 1967, replacing Tamiami Airport, next to the Tamiami Trail. Growth of the surrounding area and the nearby flight path to Miami International Airport had forced the move to the southwest, near the community of Kendall. Florida International University is now on the site of the old Tamiami Airport. Kendall-Tamiami airport is owned and operated by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department. 450 aircraft are based there, mostly single-engine \n\n Southwest Airlines began service in May 2010 with eight daily Boeing 737 flights, two each to Baltimore-Washington (BWI), Houston–Hobby (HOU), Nashville (BNA), and Orlando (MCO). Southwest Airlines then started daily seasonal nonstop service to St. Louis (STL) on June 3, 2012. Effective in early March 2016, Delta Air Lines was operating up to six nonstop flights a day to Atlanta (ATL) operated with Boeing 717, McDonnell Douglas MD-88 and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 jetliners. Delta has also operated Boeing 737 jets into the airport in the past. Delta Connection had operated regional jet aircraft on their flights to Atlanta but currently does not serve the airport. United Express utilizes Mesa Airlines and CommutAir regional jets on their nonstop flights to George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). Seasonally, flights are operated by Air Wisconsin to O'Hare International Airport. On January 18, 2018, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport announced the beginning of American Airlines nonstop flights to Charlotte Douglas (CLT) and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), which commenced on June 7, 2018. There are two flights per day to both destinations operated by American Eagle regional carriers PSA Airlines and Mesa Airlines, respectively.\n\n Airports serve as a terminus for air transport activities, but most people and cargo transported by air must use ground transport to reach their final destination. Airport-based services are sometimes used to shuttle people to nearby hotels or motels when overnight stay is required for connecting flights. Companies provide rental car, private bus and taxi services while mass transportation is usually provided by a municipality or other source of public funding. Several major airports, including Denver International and JFK International, provide many types of ground transportation, often by working with livery companies and similar businesses. Smaller airports might only have a few private rental companies and a bus service. Larger airports tend to offer several different transportation options. Larger airports also sometimes have light rail and/or roads that loop around an airport to provide access from multiple terminals.\n\n scene and reported beer bottles falling out of the aircraft as they arrested the teens, all of whom were charged with various felonies relating to the unauthorized use of the aircraft, theft, and alcohol impairment.

In this Congress, Class 1 meant their term began in this Congress, facing re-election in 1880; Class 2 meant their term ended in this Congress, facing re-election in 1876; and Class 3 meant their term began in the last Congress, facing re-election in 1878.\n\n The Senate is the upper house of the bicameral legislative branch of Liberia, and together with the House of Representatives comprises the Legislature of Liberia. Each of the fifteen counties are equally represented by two senators, elected to serve staggered nine-year terms. The Senate meets at the Capitol Building in Monrovia. The Senate is largely modeled on the United States Senate. The Constitution vests the legislative power of Liberia in both the Senate and the House, which must both concur on a bill prior to it being sent to the president. In addition, the Senate possesses several exclusive powers under the Constitution, including the power to advise and consent to the president's appointments to both the executive and judicial branches and the duty to try all public officials impeached by the House of Representatives.\n\n The Ohio Senate is the upper house of the Ohio General Assembly. The State Senate, which meets in the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, first convened in 1803. Senators are elected for four year terms, staggered every two years such that half of the seats are contested at each election. Even numbered seats and odd numbered seats are contested in separate election years. The president of the Ohio Senate presides over the body when in session, and is currently Matt Huffman. Currently, the Senate consists of 25 Republicans and eight Democrats, with the Republicans controlling three more seats than the 22 required for a supermajority vote. Senators are limited to two consecutive terms. Each senator represents approximately 349,000 Ohioans, and each Senate district encompasses three corresponding Ohio House of Representatives districts.\n\n The Connecticut State Senate is the upper house of the Connecticut General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Connecticut. The state senate comprises 36 members, each representing a district with around 99,280 inhabitants. Senators are elected to two-year terms without term limits. The Connecticut State Senate is one of 14 state legislative upper houses whose members serve two-year terms; four-year terms are more common. As in other upper houses of state and territorial legislatures and the federal U.S. Senate, the Senate is reserved with special functions such as confirming or rejecting gubernatorial appointments to the state's executive departments, the state cabinet, commissions and boards. Unlike a majority of U.S. state legislatures, both the Connecticut House of Representatives and the State Senate vote on the composition to the Connecticut Supreme Court. The Senate meets within the State Capitol in Hartford.\n\n The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, with the House of Representatives being the lower chamber. Together they compose the national bicameral legislature of the United States. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety. Each state is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years.

The Soviet Union reoccupied the Baltic states in 1944–1945 as the war drew to a close. Immediately after the war, a major influx from other USSR republics primarily of ethnic Russians took place in the Baltic states as part of a de facto process of Russification.

The influx included the establishment of military bases and associated personnel with the Baltic states now \n\n territory it occupies\"). The convention was adopted in 1949, including by the Soviet Union. However, as the Soviet Union maintained the Baltic States joined the USSR voluntarily, it did not consider the convention applicable to the Baltic states. Continuing the position of their legations or governments in exile, and based on international law and treaties in effect at the time of initial Soviet occupation, the Baltic states view the Soviet presence in the Baltic states as an illegal occupation for its full duration. This continuity of the Baltic states with their first period of independence has been used to re-adopt pre-World War II laws, constitutions, and \n\n The Soviet Baltic Fleet was the largest of the four fleets which made up the Soviet Navy during World War II, and was commanded by Vladimir Tributs throughout the war. Though initially having bases only in the eastern corner of the Gulf of Finland, the Red Banner Baltic Fleet was the largest naval power in the Baltic Sea. As World War II progressed, it was able to make use of naval bases in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, first under the terms of agreements forced by the Soviet Union in autumn 1939, then by direct access to the bases following the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in June 1940. Gains from the peace treaty after the Winter War further helped the Baltic Fleet, as it acquired a base at Hanko, Finland, as well as the coast of the Karelian Isthmus. Liepāja and Tallinn were the main naval bases of the Baltic Fleet prior to Operation Barbarossa.\n\n war, all of Lithuania was surrendered to the Soviet Union, along with the other Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia, as a consequence of the Yalta Agreement. Although the United States maintained after Yalta that the Baltic states had been illegally annexed to the Soviet Union, this meant little until the administration of Mikhail Gorbachev conceded that the departure of the Baltic states was inevitable, and the Soviet Union, at last, recognized their independence on 6 September 1991. The last Soviet troops withdrew in August 1994. In 1945, the Soviets denied the existence of the Lithuania Minor ethnographic region, out of political advantage, and declared the Klaipėda region a part of Žemaitija.\n\n This region is located in Northern Europe around the Baltic Sea.

Trump suggested that those who partake in the practice were disrespecting the country's heritage, and asked his audience, \"wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired!'\" During the subsequent weekend of games, over 200 players protested the remarks, by either kneeling or locking arms during the playing of the national anthem. The Pittsburgh Steelers (with the exception of offensive tackle and former Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva), Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks chose to not go out on field at all during the anthem.\n\n Taking the knee (or taking a knee) is a symbolic gesture against racism whereby an individual kneels upon one knee in place of standing to attention for an anthem or other such occasion. It was originated by American football player Colin Kaepernick on September 1, 2016, in protest against the lack of attention given to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Kaepernick's protest led to a wider series of national anthem protests. It has since been adopted by sports players in countries around the world, including soccer in the United Kingdom, in solidarity with Kaepernick's protest against racism, and has been seen worldwide in non-sporting contexts such as the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n On September 24, 2017, prior to a game against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, the Steelers did not take the field for the national anthem in order to avoid getting caught up in the controversy related to players kneeling or displaying other signs of racial protest around the NFL started by Colin Kaepernick. Villanueva was the lone member of the Steelers to appear publicly for the national anthem, standing in front of the entrance tunnel for the performance while the rest of the team remained in the tunnel. Head coach Mike Tomlin stated a wish to simply play the game and not allow for any show of support one way or the other on the issue. Likely as a result of this, Villanueva's jersey became the top selling \n\n The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. \"After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,\" said Reid. \"We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture.

Its architect was J. Cleaveland Cady, who was just beginning his career and would go on to design the original Metropolitan Opera House, the American Museum of Natural History, buildings at Yale University, Trinity College, and 23 other churches, but he never designed any other churches in the Carpenter Gothic style. The congregation which dates back to 1842, is noted for its association with Theodore Roosevelt Sr., his wife, Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, and their children including their son, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the future President of the United States. The funeral of Theodore Roosevelt Sr., was held in this building in 1878. On December 12, 1976, the church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n that the Democratic nominee, Franklin Roosevelt, was not her son. Edith had disliked Eleanor since Eleanor's childhood, and there had been bad blood between the two since the 1920s when Eleanor campaigned against Theodore Roosevelt Jr. during his run for governor of New York. Before her death, Edith destroyed almost all of her correspondence with her husband. However, Edith was a prodigious letter writer and her letters survive in archives such as the Houghton Library. Edith died at Sagamore Hill on September 30, 1948, at the age of 87. She is buried next to her husband at Youngs Memorial Cemetery in Oyster Bay.\n\n Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site preserves the Ansley Wilcox House, at 641 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, New York.

Overcoming the opposition of much of the military establishment, who doubted Britain's ability to remain in the war against Germany, Roosevelt pursued policies designed to maximize arms transfers to Britain and overcoming the opposition of much of the government, Roosevelt rejected the convoy escort across the Atlantic for one more year. In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up the American military, but Roosevelt himself sided with the isolationists in not getting the \n\n The conference brought together the top British and American military leaders, as well as Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt and their aides, in Washington from December 22, 1941, to January 14, 1942, and led to a series of major decisions that shaped the war effort in 1942–1943. Arcadia was the first meeting on military strategy between Britain and the United States; it came two weeks after the American entry into World War II. The Arcadia Conference was a secret agreement unlike the much wider postwar plans given to the public as the Atlantic Charter, agreed between Churchill and Roosevelt in August 1941. The main policy achievements of Arcadia included the decision for \"Germany First\" (or \"Europe first\"—that is, the defeat of Germany was the highest priority); the establishment of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, based in Washington, for approving the military decisions of both the \n\nDuring both the Great Depression and World War II, Franklin Roosevelt garnered popular support due to a variety of factors. Firstly, his leadership style and communication skills played a crucial role in winning the public's confidence. Roosevelt was known for his ability to connect with the American people through his fireside chats, where he explained his policies and reassured citizens during times of crisis.\n\nSecondly, Roosevelt's implementation of various economic recovery programs, such as the New Deal, helped alleviate the hardships faced by the American people during the Great Depression. These programs aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform by creating jobs, regulating the financial system, and fostering economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, Roosevelt's decisive actions and strong leadership during World War II were instrumental in garnering support. He led the nation through this challenging time, effectively mobilizing and uniting the American people towards a common goal. His administration's efforts in creating war industries, implementing rationing, and promoting patriotism fostered a sense of solidarity among citizens.\n\nRegarding the role of economic class in shaping support, it is noteworthy that Roosevelt's approval ratings during peacetime were divided along class lines. Different economic classes had varying interests and concerns, which influenced their opinions of his policies. However, during the war, class divisions blurred as the nation faced a common enemy, and the focus shifted towards patriotism and national unity.\n\nOverall, Roosevelt's popular support was influenced by his leadership, effective communication, and the tangible impact of his policies in alleviating the hardships of the Great Depression. Additionally, his strong leadership during World War II further solidified his support among the American people, with economic class playing a role in shaping opinions, particularly during peacetime.\n\n Military strategy for the war as a whole was discussed among the Big Three powers, and especially among the United Kingdom and the United States, who were especially close, with numerous calls and meetings held between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In addition, the leaders of the Big Three met at conferences during the war to decide on overall military strategy. The Arcadia Conference held in Washington, D.C. from December 22, 1941 to January 14, 1942 followed the American and the British declarations of war on Japan; Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States. The main policy decisions of Arcadia included the \"Germany First\" (also known as \"Europe first\") policy that the defeat of Germany had higher priority than the war with Japan. The Second Washington Conference in June 1942 confirmed a decision not to open a second front \n\n President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace won the election of 1940, and were at the helm of the nation as it prepared for and entered World War II. Roosevelt sought and won a fourth term in office in 1944, but this time with Harry S. Truman as his Vice President. Roosevelt, who had been a victim of polio early in life, died in April 1945, and Truman assumed the Presidency through the end of the war.\n\nQuestion: who was the leader of the us during wwii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He moved to Paris in 1957. There he became a disciple of Pablo Picasso. He exposed his artwork in many countries, including Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. His most important works are titled Dona i lluna (woman and moon), Montblanc and Guer-Blanc. He signed his works Palau Ferré. Palau Ferré was known for his sudden swings of humor and became notorious in 1974 for burning his oil paintings as a protest against the unfavorable resolution of a legal conflict he had with an art dealer. Clamoring against the \"prostitution of art\", he kept burning all of his paintings he was able to lay his hands on \n\n Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (, ; ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist. Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. Gauguin was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.\n\n design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. Later, he influenced Arthur Frank Mathews and the American Arts and Crafts movement. John Rewald, recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin (1956) and an essay, Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and André Fontainas (included in Rewald's Studies in Post-Impressionism, 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.\n\n The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Matisse's second version of The Dance signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism. Pablo Picasso \n\n The unofficial art mouvement of Fauvism (Fauves is the French word for \"wild beasts\"). Henri Matisse (1869–1954) was the leader of the small group, with other major artists including André Derain (1880–1954) and maurice de Vlaminick (1876–1958). The mouvement was never made official with documents signed by members of a list of criteria in order for work to be considered Fauvism, but it was simply a small group of mainly French painters who used brilliant colour and unexpected brushstrokes, similar to the German Expressionism mouvement. Matisse created the Fauve style after experimenting with post-impressionistic painters, such as Gauguin, Cézanne and Van Gogh, as well as the Neo-impressionism of Cross, Signac and Seurat. All these painters inspired Matisse to reject 3D uses of spaces and use colour and mouvement to create 2D planes of space.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In April and May 2011, a combination of heavy rainfall and melting snow caused a flood that closed the Mississippi River to navigation, threatened Caruthersville, and prompted evacuation of Cairo, Illinois, due to concerns that its flood protection levees might fail. To protect Cairo, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway, which lowered the river by flooding more than 100,000 acres of farmland in Missouri. Later that spring, heavy rains and rapid snowmelt upstream led to flooding along the Missouri River, which damaged property and closed the river to navigation. Although springtime in Missouri is likely to be wetter, summer droughts are likely to be more severe. Higher evaporation and lower summer rainfall are likely to reduce river flows. The drought of 2012 narrowed navigation channels, forced lock closures, and caused dozens of barges to run aground on the Mississippi River along the Missouri shoreline. The resulting impact on navigation cost the region more than $275 million. The drought of 2012–2013 also threatened municipal and industrial water users along the Missouri River\".\n\n claimed locations ultimately drain into the Jefferson. Lewis on August 12, 1805 said he visited the headwaters on Trail Creek just above Lemhi Pass on the Continental Divide in the Beaverhead Mountains at around 8,600 feet which he described:  In 1888 Jacob V. Brower, who had championed turning the headwaters of the Mississippi River into a Minnesota state park, visited another site which today is also claimed to be the furthest point on the Missouri. Brower published his finding in 1896 in \"The Missouri: Its Utmost Source.\" Brower's Spring, as the site is now known, is at around 8,800 feet in the Centennial Mountains. The site is commemorated by a rock pile at the source of Hellroaring Creek which flows into Red Rock River and then into Clark Canyon Reservoir where it joins the Beaverhead then the Big Hole River before ultimately hooking up with the Jefferson.\n\n Below the Highway 136 bridge at Livonia, Missouri, the river has been channelized and dredged. The largest amount of this happened in 1948 and 1949 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, \"public use of Chariton River watershed streams is very low, largely because instream habitat has been so adversely affected by channelization and sedimentation\". Major tributaries are Mussel Fork Creek and Shoal Creek. Because of extensive channeling the Little Chariton River, formerly a tributary, now flows directly into the Missouri about 7 mi from the main branch. A branch of the Little Chariton was dammed in Macon County, Missouri to create Long Branch Reservoir.\n\n The Missouri River is a long stream that originates in southwest Montana and flows southeasterly for 2,522 miles; passing through six states before finally entering the Mississippi River at St. Louis.

Inflation was kept reasonably low within a range of 3.4–5.7%. The baht was pegged at 25 to the U.S. dollar. On 14 and 15 May 1997, the Thai baht was hit by massive speculative attacks. On 30 June 1997, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said that he would not devalue the baht. However, Thailand lacked the foreign reserves to support the USD–Baht currency peg, and the Thai government was eventually forced to float the Baht, on 2 July 1997, allowing the value of the Baht to be set by the currency market. This caused a chain reaction of events, eventually culminating into a region-wide crisis.

However, according to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The 1905 law on secularity was highly controversial at the time, but today is held as a founding document of French secularism or laïcité. Some French politicians and communities have more recently questioned the law, arguing that, despite its explicit stance for state secularism, it de facto favors traditional French religions, in particular the Catholic Church, at the expense of more recently established religions, such as Islam.

In 2016, Hawking et al. proposed new theories of information moving in and out of a black hole. The 2016 work posits that the information is saved in \"soft particles\", low-energy versions of photons and other particles that exist in zero-energy empty space. Significant progress was made in 2019, when Penington et al. discovered a class of semiclassical spacetime geometries that had been overlooked by Hawking and subsequent researchers. Hawking's calculation appears to show that the Hawking radiation's entropy increases throughout the lifetime of the black hole. However, if the black hole formed from a known state (zero entropy), the entropy of the Hawking radiation must decrease back to zero once \n\n to the award. Hawking's argument that he solved the paradox has not yet been wholly accepted by the scientific community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens. Hawking had earlier speculated that the singularity at the centre of a black hole could form a bridge to a \"baby universe\", into which the lost information could pass; such theories have been very popular in science fiction. But according to Hawking's new idea, presented at the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation, on 21 July \n\n In 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation at a temperature ℏc3/(8πGMkB); this effect has become known as Hawking radiation. By applying quantum field theory to a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect black body spectrum. Since Hawking's publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches. If Hawking's theory of black hole radiation is correct, then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles. The temperature of this \n\n In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics).

They enjoy popularity even among non-Egyptians. The Egyptian national football team won the African Cup of Nations seven times, setting a new record in Africa (years: 57, 59, 86, 98, 06, 08, 10). Egypt was the first African country to join FIFA, but it has only made it to the FIFA World Cup three times, in 1934, 1990 and 2018.

In ancient Egypt, Upper Egypt was known as tꜣ šmꜣw, literally \"the Land of Reeds\" or \"the Sedgeland\". It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during Naqada III and its unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period. Both Upper and Lower Egypt became imbedded within the symbolism of the sovereignty in Ancient Egypt such as the Pschent double crown. Upper Egypt remained as a historical distinction even after the classical period.\n\nNile Valley and Nile Delta ; Western Desert (from the Nile west to the Libyan border) ; Eastern Desert (extends from the Nile Valley all the way to the Red Sea coast) ; Sinai Peninsula Egypt is predominantly desert. 35,000 km2 - 3.5% - of the total land area is cultivated and permanently settled. Most of the country lies within the wide band of desert that stretches eastwards from Africa's Atlantic Coast across the continent and into southwest Asia.

However, when he arrives home, he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.

At this time, conflict began to grow between the Iroquois Confederacy and the tribes supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. Their lands were surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking tribes, all traditional enemies, including the Shawnee to the west in the Ohio Country, the Neutral Nation and Huron confederacies on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, and the Susquehannock to their south.

According to Norse sagas, the Skrælings of Vinland responded so ferociously that the newcomers eventually withdrew and gave up their plans to settle the area. Prior to French settlements in the St. Lawrence River valley, the local Iroquoian peoples were almost completely displaced, probably because of warfare with their neighbours the Algonquin. The Iroquois League was established prior to major European contact. Most archaeologists and anthropologists believe that the League was formed sometime between 1450 and 1600.

Examples preceding European contact include the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, the Blackfoot Confederacy, and Powhatan Confederacy in three different regions. There were other confederacies in New England, New York, and in the Southeast British colonies. Other groups formed later to enter into treaties with colonial governments led by ethnic French, Spanish and English.

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the potlatch. These gatherings were usually organized to commemorate special events such as the raising of a Totem pole or the celebration of a new chief. In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies. Each tribe had seats in a group of 50 sachem chiefs. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the United States government.

These instruments included Hammond organ on some of his songs with the Beatles, and Mellotron on several of the Western selections on his debut solo album, the Wonderwall Music film soundtrack. Described by producer George Martin as the most dedicated of the Beatles in finding and creating new sounds for the band's studio recordings, Harrison became intrigued by the potential of the Moog synthesizer while in Los Angeles in late 1968. He was introduced to the instrument by Bernie Krause, who, along with his Beaver & Krause partner Paul Beaver, was the Moog company's sales representative for the US West Coast. An off-shoot of the Beatles' Apple record label, Zapple Records was intended \n\nQuestion: what kind of guitar did george harrison use?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dene or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Alaska, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the American Southwest as far as northern Mexico. The southwestern division of Athabaskan is also called Southern Athabaskan or Apachean, and includes Navajo and all the Apache languages. Eyak was spoken in south-central Alaska; the last first language speaker died in 2008. Navajo is by far the most widely spoken language of the Na-Dene family, spoken in Arizona, New Mexico, and other regions of the American Southwest.\n\n The NLA organizes efforts of linguists and language instructors to train teachers of Navajo. Summer workshops on the Navajo language, applied linguistics, and general linguistics have been offered every summer since 1997. Undergraduate-level courses are offered for college credit. The NLA differs from such related organizations as the Navajo Nation Division of Diné Education, Diné College, and the Navajo Language Teachers Association in focusing on scientific research on the Navajo language and on teaching Navajo people, especially language teachers, how to carry out linguistic research and to use existing reference materials. The Board of Directors of the NLA includes Navajo linguist Ellavina Perkins. The NLA maintains a comprehensive bibliography on Navajo linguistics, available on its web site, and holds the archive of the Navajo material of linguist Ken Hale.\n\n According to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo. Navajo is an Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Altogether, Navajo speakers make up more than 50% of all Native American language speakers in the United States. Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Navajo has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation, including a Navajo language immersion school in Fort Defiance, Arizona.\n\nQuestion: what language do navajo people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Access to higher education in Latin America shows a massive gap when it comes to income distribution in many Latin American countries. Although higher education is not new to the region; indeed, many institutions date back hundreds of years, but the noticeable growth spurt in the area of higher education has been more recent. Latin Americans value higher education in general, according to the Applicant survey of 2016/2017.

South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean. North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface. As of 2018, its population is more than 430 million, according to estimates of population in The World Factbook. South America ranks fourth among all continents in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). The border between North and South America is at some point in the Isthmus of Panama. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the Darién Mountains watershed that divides along the Colombia–Panama border where the isthmus meets the South American continent (see Darién Gap).

It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces. The UN Security Council mandate for US‑led forces in Iraq will terminate \"if requested by the government of Iraq.\" 59% of those polled in the US support a timetable for withdrawal. In mid-2007, the Coalition began a controversial program to recruit Iraqi Sunnis (often former insurgents) for the formation of \"Guardian\" militias. These Guardian militias are intended to support and secure various Sunni neighborhoods against the Islamists.\n\n the war was unnecessary. When interrogated by the FBI, Saddam Hussein confirmed that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction prior to the US invasion. In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held multi-party elections in 2005. Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki government enacted policies that alienated the country's previously dominant Sunni minority and worsened sectarian tensions.

The Viet Minh drive the French from the border region and begin to receive large amounts of weapons from the Soviet Union and China. The weapons transform the Viet Minh from an irregular large-scale insurgency into a conventional army. \n\n After World War II, Vietnamese revolutionaries under Communist leader Ho Chi Minh sought to gain independence from France. The 1954 Geneva Agreements had partitioned French Indochina into the Kingdom of Laos, the Kingdom of Cambodia, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam, the latter of which was controlled by the Communist Viet Minh. The Vietnam War began in 1955 as North Vietnamese forces, with the support of the Soviet Union, China, and other Communist governments, sought to reunify Vietnam by taking control of South Vietnam.

The North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched the Spring Offensive in March; the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) was quickly defeated. The North Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30, accepting the surrender of South Vietnam. In the final days of the war, the United States, which had supported South Vietnam for many years, carried out an emergency evacuation of its civilian and military personnel and more than 130,000 Vietnamese. At the beginning of the Spring Offensive the balance of forces in Vietnam was approximately as follows; North Vietnam: 305,000 soldiers, 600 armored vehicles and 490 heavy artillery pieces in South Vietnam and South Vietnam: 1.0 million soldiers, 1,200 to 1,400 tanks and more than 1,000 pieces of heavy artillery. The capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, was captured by the Khmer Rouge on April 17. On December 2 the Pathet Lao took over the government of Laos, thus completing the communist conquest of the three Indochinese countries.\n\n The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, occurred from 1959 to April 30, 1975. The term Vietnam Conflict is often used to refer to events which took place between 1959 and April 30, 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam. It concluded with the defeat and failure of the United States foreign policy in Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, the capital of South Vietnam, Saigon fell to the communist forces of North Vietnam, effectively ending the Vietnam War. Over 8.7 million U.S. forces participated in the Vietnam War; of whom slightly over 47,000 were killed in battle and almost 11,000 more died of non-battle causes. During the Vietnam War three Asian Americans received the Medal of Honor, all of them posthumously. Elmelindo Smith, although wounded multiple times was killed while fighting with his unit. Terry Kawamura sacrificed his life by jumping on an explosive charge, saving the lives of two other soldiers, and Rodney Yano sacrificed his life by throwing burning ammunition off of a helicopter after a grenade exploded prematurely.\n\n The Vietnam War was a Cold War military conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from November 1955 to April 1975. In 1954, colonial France surrendered to the Viet Minh rebels ending the First Indochina War, creating the nations of North and South Vietnam along the 17th parallel. The Vietnam War began shortly thereafter and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by such communist allies as China and the Soviet Union, and South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist nations.

The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002 (having been distributed in small amounts in the previous December). Beginning on 1 January 1999, all bonds \n\n Nations were allowed to keep legacy currency in circulation as legal tender for two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany; the Deutsche Mark officially ceased to be legal tender after 31 December 2001. Most member states, though, permitted their legacy currency to remain in circulation the full two months. The legacy currency was exchangeable at commercial banks in the currency's nation for a further period, generally until 30 June 2002. However, even after the official dates, they continued to be accepted for exchange by national central banks for varying periods—and indefinitely in Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Spain. Coins from those four countries, Italy, and Finland remain exchangeable. The earliest coins \n\n members also use the euro as their currency. Additionally, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro. The euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar. , with more than €1.3 trillion in circulation, the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world. The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). \n\n 2 January, all ATMs in 7 countries and at least 90 percent in 4 others were issuing euros rather than legacy currency, with Italy, the worst offender, having only 85% of ATMs dispensing euros. The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency. Some businesses did take advantage of the currency exchange to raise prices. According to a study by the Deutsche Bundesbank, there was a price rise, but consumers refused to buy as much. A coffee bar in Italy that took advantage of the transition to raise coffee prices by a third was ordered to pay compensation to customers.\n\n Before the introduction of the euro notes and coins in January 2002, Ireland used the Irish pound or punt. In January 1999 Ireland was one of eleven European Union member states which launched the European Single Currency, the euro. Euro banknotes are issued in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100 and €200 denominations and share the common design used across Europe, however like other countries in the eurozone, Ireland has its own unique design on one face of euro coins. The government decided on a single national design for all Irish coin denominations, which show a Celtic harp, a traditional symbol of Ireland, decorated with the year of issue and the word Éire which means \"Ireland\" in the Irish language.\n\nQuestion: what is the currency used in italy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Almirola shot across the track and collected several more cars including Patrick, Waltrip, Parker Kligerman, Paul Menard, David Gilliland, Josh Wise, Austin Dillon, Justin Allgaier, Kasey Kahne and Marcos Ambrose. Patrick took the worst hit, as her car got turned by Almirola and slammed the outside wall in the tri-oval in a part of the track that lacked a SAFER barrier; the section of wall where Patrick hit the wall would receive a SAFER barrier before the rain-shortened Coke Zero 400 that summer. Upon exiting her car, Patrick felt \"upset because the car felt really good, it was the best car [she's] had all of Speedweeks\" and that her car \"could catch whoever and move around...and move forward\".

It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than 30 km north of Memphis (Men-nefer), which was the capital city of the first unified Egyptian state from the days of the first pharaoh, Narmer. Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, including the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples.

He had a wealth of both knowledge and books on Canadian subjects and welcomed students to consult his private library. The library eventually expanded beyond the room in his mansion devoted to it, to encompass the house's den, maid's sitting room, and garage as well. After his death, the collection was donated and sold to the university's library system; it was described in 1967 as \"still the most important rare collection in the library\". Rutherford remained on the university's senate until 1927, when he was elected Chancellor. The position was the titular head of the university, and its primary duty was presiding over convocations. According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock, it was the honour that Rutherford prized most. He was acclaimed \n\n Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand-born British physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. Encyclopædia Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday (1791–1867). He also spent a substantial amount of his career abroad, in both Canada and the United Kingdom. In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. This work was performed at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry he was awarded in 1908 \"for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances\", for which he \n\n Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near Ormond, Canada West, on his family's dairy farm. His parents, James (1817&ndash;1891) and Elspet \"Elizabeth\" (1818&ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford, had immigrated from Scotland two years previous. They joined the Baptist Church, and his father joined the Liberal Party of Canada and served for a time on the Osgoode village council. Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a Metcalfe high school. After graduating in 1874, he attended the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist college in Woodstock. He graduated from there in 1876 and taught for a year in Osgoode. He moved to Montreal to study arts and law at McGill University. He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the Ottawa law firm of \n\n the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform the awarded work in Canada. In 1904, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a Nobel laureate. In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. He performed the first \n\n the Mayfair Golf and Country Club. He received honorary doctorates of laws from four universities: McGill, the University of Alberta, McMaster University, and the University of Toronto. In 1911, the Rutherfords built a new house adjacent to the University of Alberta campus. Rutherford named it \"Archnacarry\", after his ancestral homeland in Scotland. Now known as Rutherford House, it serves as a museum. He made several trips to the United Kingdom and was invited to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, but he had to return to Canada before the event. On December 19, 1938, the Rutherfords celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary; tributes and well wishes arrived from across Canada.\n\nQuestion: what school did sir ernest rutherford go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Laos is represented by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Hanoi for ROC-related matters. Relations have consisted of trade and aid, largely focused on road construction in the northern provinces of Laos, without directly challenging the interests of Thailand or Vietnam in the central and southern regions. However, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in December 1978 to unseat the Khmer Rouge regime provoked China into a limited invasion of Vietnam—approximately nineteen kilometers deep—to \"teach Vietnam a lesson.\" Laos was caught in a dangerous bind, not wanting to further provoke China, but not able to oppose its special partner, Vietnam. The Laotian leadership \n\n The people of Laos have a rich literary tradition dating back at least six hundred years, with the oral and storytelling traditions of its peoples dating back much earlier. Lao literature refers to the written productions of Laotian peoples, its émigrés, and to Lao-language works. In Laos today there are over forty-seven recognized ethnic groups, with the Lao Loum comprising the majority group. Lao (part of the Lao-Tai family) is officially recognized as the national language, but owing to the ethnic diversity of the country the literature of Laos can generally be grouped according to four ethnolinguistic families: Lao-Tai (Tai-Kadai); Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic); Hmong-Mien (Miao-Yao), and Sino-Tibetan (primarily Tibeto-Burman). As an inland crossroads of Southeast Asia the political history of Laos has been complicated by frequent warfare and colonial conquests by European and regional rivals. As a result, Laos today has cultural influence from France, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia.\n\n The province is in the valley of the Mae Nam Kong (Mekong River), which also forms the border with Laos. There are highlands to the south. The total forest area is 233 km² or 7.1 percent of provincial area. The Laotian capital, Vientiane, is only 25 km from the provincial capital of Nong Khai. The First Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge, which connects the two countries, was built jointly by the governments of Thailand, Laos, and Australia, and was opened in 1994. Nong Khai is the smallest province in the northeastern after Bueng Kan and other seven districts became Bueng Kan Province in 2011.\n\n Laos developed its culture and customs as the inland crossroads of trade and migration in Southeast Asia over millennia. As of 2012 Laos has a population of roughly 6.4 million spread over 236,800 km2 (91,400 sq miles), yielding one of the lowest population densities in Asia. Yet the country of Laos has an official count of over forty-seven ethnicities divided into 149 sub-groups and 80 different languages. The Lao Loum have throughout the country's history comprised the ethnic and linguistic majority. In Southeast Asia, traditional Lao culture is considered one of the Indic cultures (along with Burma, Thailand and Cambodia). Laos is geographically isolated and mountainous, bounded by the Annamite Range in the east, forming a traditional political and cultural boundary with Vietnam (a more Chinese influenced Sinitic culture). Much of \n\n This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Laos. Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, bordered by Burma and People's Republic of China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south and Thailand to the west. Laos traces its history to the Kingdom of Lan Xang or Land of a Million Elephants, which existed from the 14th to the 18th century. After a period as a French protectorate, Laos gained independence in 1953. A long civil war ended officially when the Communist Pathet Lao movement came to power in 1975.\n\nQuestion: where is laos in world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cato's Origines, the first work of history composed in Latin, described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps. According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the \"walls of Italy\". In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south. The northern area of Cisalpine Gaul was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and de facto part of Italy, but remained politically and de jure separated. It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Italy in \n\n range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as Geneva, the demarcation is less clear. The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Austria (28.7% of the total area), Italy (27.2%), France (21.4%) and Switzerland (13.2%). The highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the Rhône valley, from Mont Blanc to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa on the southern side, and the Bernese Alps on the northern. The peaks in the easterly portion of the range, in Austria and Slovenia, are smaller than those in the central and western portions. The variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the Alps makes classification of the \n\n  The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1200 km across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. The Alpine arch generally extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4809 m is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area \n\n Umbria is bordered by Tuscany to the west and the north, Marche to the east and Lazio to the south. Partly hilly and mountainous, and partly flat and fertile owing to the valley of the Tiber, its topography includes part of the central Apennines, with the highest point in the region at Monte Vettore on the border of the Marche, at 2,476 m; the lowest point is Attigliano, 96 m. It is the only Italian region having neither a coastline nor a common border with other countries. The comune of Città di Castello has an exclave named Monte Ruperto within Marche. Contained within Umbria is the hamlet of Cospaia, which was a tiny \n\n border are parallel to this latter range, with their corresponding depressions occupied by the glaciers of Gorner and Findelen. On clear days the mountainous massif of Monte Rosa provides a striking view from the Po plain, particularly its upper reaches in western Lombardy and eastern Piedmont. It dominates the horizon, towering between other lesser Alpine peaks as a prominent, multi-pointed, razor-sharp bulge, its permanent glaciers shining under the sun.  The massif is the border between Switzerland and Italy, though glacial melt has caused some alterations to the border. These changes were ratified by the two countries in 2009 and will continue to be subject to change as melting continues.\n\nQuestion: what countries are near italy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It flows west to east starting in Colorado and dumping into the Mississippi River. Its length of 1,469 miles allows it to flow through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. It is the sixth-longest river in the US, the second-longest tributary to the Mississippi River System, and the 45th longest river in the world.\n\n  The Columbia Plateau is a geologic and geographic region that lies across parts of the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is a wide flood basalt plateau between the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains, cut through by the Columbia River. In one of various usages, the term \"Columbia Basin\" refers to more or less the same area as the Columbia Plateau. The Basin and Range province covers most of the state of Nevada and parts of the states of Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as much of northern Mexico. It is an extremely arid region characterized by basin and range topography. The Colorado Plateau is an area of high desert located in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, bisected by the Colorado River which flows westward through the southern part, and the Green River which flows south from the northernmost part of the plateau. The Green is a tributary of the Colorado, the confluence being west of Moab, Utah in Canyonlands National Park.\n\n  The South Platte River is one of the two principal tributaries of the Platte River. Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. It joins the North Platte River in western Nebraska to form the Platte, which then flows across Nebraska to the Missouri. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. In its valley along the foothills in Colorado, it has permitted agriculture in an area of the Colorado Piedmont and Great Plains that is otherwise arid.\n\n  The Lower Colorado River Valley (LCRV) is the river region of the lower Colorado River of the southwestern United States in North America that rises in the Rocky Mountains and has its outlet at the Colorado River Delta in the northern Gulf of California in northwestern Mexico, between the states of Baja California and Sonora. This north&ndash;south stretch of the Colorado River forms the border between the U.S. states of California/Arizona and Nevada/Arizona, and between the Mexican states of Baja California/Sonora. It is commonly defined as the region from below Hoover Dam and Lake Mead to its outlet at the northern Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez); it includes the Colorado River proper, canyons, the valley, mountain ranges with wilderness areas, and the floodplain and associated riparian environments. It is home to recreation activities from the river, the lakes created by dams, agriculture, and the home of various cities, communities, and towns along the river, or associated with the valley region. Five Indian reservations are located in the LCRV: the Chemehuevi, Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian Reservations; at Yuma are the Quechan and Cocopah reservations.\n\n This is a list of drainage basins in the U.S. State of Colorado. The U.S. State of Colorado includes the headwaters of several important rivers. The state is divided into two major hydrographic regions by the Continental Divide of the Americas. East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way. West of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow via the Green River, the upper Colorado River (formerly the Grand River), or the San Juan River into the Colorado River and on to the Gulf of California. Colorado also has three significant endorheic basins: the San Luis Closed Basin in the San Luis Valley, and the Bear Creek Basin and the White Woman Basin spanning the Colorado-Kansas border north and south of the Arkansas River.\n\nQuestion: which states does the colorado river run through?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it. While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of \n\n Roman rule, which would have profound cultural and historical impacts. Roman rule brought with it Latin, the language of the Romans. This would evolve into Old French, giving the modern French language its Latin roots. Conquering Gaul enabled further expansion of the Empire into Northwestern Europe. Augustus would push into Germania and reach the Elbe, though settled on the Rhine as the imperial border following the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In addition to facilitating the conquest of parts of Germania, the Roman conquest of Britain led in 43 AD by Claudius also built on Caesar's invasions. The Roman hegemony would last, with only one interruption, until the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 AD.\n\n The Fall of the Western Roman Empire allowed its successor state, the Byzantine Empire, to continue Roman control over the Aegean Sea. However, their territory would later be threatened by the Early Muslim conquests initiated by Muhammad in the 7th century. Although the Rashidun Caliphate did not manage to obtain land along the coast of the Aegean sea, its conquest of the Eastern Anatolian peninsula as well as Egypt, the Levant, and North Africa left the Byzantine Empire weakened. The Umayyad Caliphate expanded the territorial gains of the Rashidun Caliphate, conquering much of North Africa, and threatened the Byzantine Empire's control of Western Anatolia, where it meets the Aegean Sea. During the 820s, Crete was conquered by a \n\n Alexander the Great, spreading throughout Asia. The Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean Basin in a vast empire based on Roman law and Roman legions. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the Western Roman Empire based in Rome, and the Eastern Roman Empire based in Constantinople. The attacks of the Goths led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the \n\n The Romans (Rōmānī; ) were a cultural group, variously referred to as an ethnicity' or a nationality,' that in classical antiquity, from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD, came to rule the Near East, North Africa, and large parts of Europe through conquests made during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire.

Rainfall around the continent is across its southern portion from Eastern India and Northeast India across the Philippines, Indochina, Malay Peninsula, Malay Archipelago and Southern China into Korean Peninsula Taiwan and Japan due to the Monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region. The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. \n\n Central Asia. It is a string of oases along the northern edges of the Qilian Mountains and Altyn-Tagh, with the high and desolate Tibetan Plateau further to the south. To the north are the Longshou, Heli and Mazong Mountains separating it from the arid Badain Jaran Desert, Gobi Desert and the cold steppes of the Mongolian Plateau. At the western end, the route splits into three, going either north of the Tianshan Mountains or south on either side of the Tarim Basin. At the eastern end, the mountains around Lanzhou grants access to the Longxi Basin, which leads east through Mount Long along the Wei River valley into the populous Guanzhong Plain, and then into the Central Plain.\n\n Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62800 km. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically. The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n The Ordos Desert is almost completely encircled in the west, north and east by a great rectangular bend of the middle Yellow River known as the Ordos Loop. Mountain ranges separate the Ordos from the Gobi Desert north and east of the Yellow River. The northern border serves as the southern border of the Mu Us Desert. The mountain chains separating the Ordos from the central Gobi in the north of the great bend of the Yellow River are: the Kara-naryn-ula, the Sheitenula, and the Yin Mountains, which link on to the south end of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the south and east, the Great Wall of China separates the Ordos from fertile loess lands. The Ordos covers the southern section of Inner Mongolia, an Autonomous Region of China; Ningxia, an Autonomous Entity of China; and the Chinese Provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu.\n\n Ömnögovi (Өмнөговь Ömnögovǐ, South Gobi) is an aimag (province) of Mongolia, located in the south of the country, in the Gobi Desert. Ömnögovi is Mongolia's largest aimag. The capital is Dalanzadgad. The province is rich in mineral deposits, including gold and copper. Agriculture is of minor importance. Vegetables are grown in some oases, e.g. in Dal near Dalanzadgad. As the aimag has various sights to offer, tourism is gaining importance. Ömnögovi includes several well known tourist areas, including the Flaming Cliffs, Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park and Khongoryn Els - The Singing Sand Dunes.\n\nQuestion: where are the gobi desert located on a map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition, unlike a direct or \"pure\" democracy in which the majority vote rules, a republic codifies in a charter or constitution a certain set of basic civil rights that is guaranteed to every citizen and cannot be overridden by majority rule. The American interpretation of \"republicanism\" was inspired by the Whig party in Great Britain which openly criticized \n\n The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law takes precedent over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. After the American Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Constitution's Bill of Rights to state governments. Legislation passed by Congress, an Executive Order of the President, or a decision of federal courts pursuant to the Constitution are federal law. Through the system of checks and balances, it is the Supreme Court makes final decisions regarding federal laws regarding specific cases brought before them. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. federal laws are codified in the United States Code.\n\n Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the proposed new government. The new administration under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. James Madison spearheaded Congressional amendments to the Constitution as assurances to those cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution. Rhode Island was the final state to ratify the Constitution in 1790, the first ten amendments were ratified in 1791 and became known as the United States Bill of Rights.\n\n  The law of the United States consists of many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law, of which the most important is the United States Constitution, the foundation of the federal government of the United States. The Constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law, which consists of constitutional acts of Congress, constitutional treaties ratified by Congress, constitutional regulations promulgated by the executive branch, and case law originating from the federal judiciary. The Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land, thus preempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty U.S. states and in the territories. However, the scope of federal preemption is limited, because the scope of federal power is itself rather limited. In the unique \n\n  In the United States, many government agencies are organized under the executive branch of government, although a few are part of the judicial or legislative branches. In the federal government, the executive branch, led by the president, controls the federal executive departments, which are led by secretaries who are members of the United States Cabinet. The many independent agencies of the United States government created by statutes enacted by Congress exist outside of the federal executive departments but are still part of the executive branch. Congress has also created some special judicial bodies known as Article I tribunals to handle some areas of administrative law.

Politically the \"triangle\" consists of:  The Polish portion includes the southernmost \"panhandle\" of the Gmina Bogatynia, where the vast Turów strip mine has extracted lignite resources since 1904. The entire area is framed by mountain ranges which form a local climate, trapping air and intensifying the effects of the air pollution.\n\n Until the early 19th century Germany, a federation of numerous states of varying size and development, retained its pre-industrial character, where trade centered around a number of free cities. After the extensive development of the railway network during the 1840s, rapid economic growth and modernisation sparked the process of industrialisation. The largest economy in Europe by 1900, Germany had established a primary position in several key sectors, like the Chemical industry and steel production. High production capacity, permanent competitiveness and subsequent protectionist policies fought out with the USA and Britain were essential characteristics.

German territory covers 357022 km2, consisting of 348672 km2 of land and 8350 km2 of water. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2963 m) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 m below sea level ) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe.

After their flights in 1905 the Wrights stopped work on developing their aircraft and concentrated on trying to commercially exploit their invention, attempting to interest the military authorities of the United States and then, after being rebuffed, France and Great Britain. Consequently, attempts to achieve powered flight continued, principally in France.

They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, 4 mi south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

The dominance of Arabic and Turkish is the result of the medieval Arab and Turkic invasions beginning with the Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD, which displaced the formerly dominant Aramaic in the region of Syria, and Greek in Anatolia, although Hebrew became the dominant language in Israel in the second half of the 20th century, and Neo-Aramaic (spoken by modern Arameans, Assyrians, and Chaldeans) and Greek both remain present in their respective territories as minority languages. Significant native minorities include, in alphabetical order: Arameans, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Druze, Jews, Lurs, Mandeans, Maronites, Shabaks and Yezidis.\n\n and Mysian. Hurro-Urartian languages were spoken in the southeastern kingdom of Mitanni, while Galatian, a Celtic language, was spoken in Galatia, central Anatolia. The Turkification of Anatolia began under the rule of the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and it continued under the rule of the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and the early 20th century and it has continued under the rule of today's Republic of Turkey. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek. Other ancient peoples in the region included Galatians, Hurrians, Assyrians, Hattians, Cimmerians, as well as Ionian, Dorian, and Aeolic Greeks.\n\n literary and high-court language used by the educated in the Ottoman Empire before being displaced by Ottoman Turkish; and Arabic, which was the legal and religious language of the empire and was also spoken regionally, mainly in Arabia, North Africa, Mesopotamia and the Levant. Throughout the vast Ottoman bureaucracy Ottoman Turkish language was the official language, a version of Turkish, albeit with a vast mixture of both Arabic and Persian grammar and vocabulary. Some ordinary people had to hire special \"request-writers\" (arzuhâlcis) to be able to communicate with the government. The ethnic groups continued to speak within their families and neighborhoods (mahalles) with their own languages (e.g., Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc.) \n\n villages where two or more populations lived together, the inhabitants would often speak each other's language. In cosmopolitan cities, people often spoke their family languages, many non-ethnic Turks spoke Turkish as a second language. Educated Ottoman Turks spoke Arabic and Persian, as these were the main non-Turkish languages in the pre-Tanzimat era. In the last two centuries, French and English emerged as popular languages, especially among the Christian Levantine communities. The elite learned French at school, and used European products as a fashion statement. The use of Ottoman Turkish for science and literature grew steadily under the Ottomans, while Persian declined in those functions. Ottoman Turkish, during the period, gained many \n\n According to The Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, the Turkish language is the third most widely used language in Syria (after Arabic and Kurdish). It is spoken by the Turkmen minority mostly in villages east of the Euphrates, north of Aleppo, and on the northern coast of the country, along the Syrian-Turkish border. In addition, there are Turkish language islands in the Qalamun area and the Homs area. Moreover, Syrian Arabic dialects have also borrowed many loanwords from Turkish.

In July 2010, he joined the Knicks for the 2010 NBA Summer League where he averaged a team-high 15.6 points in addition to 4.8 rebounds and 1.6 steals in five games. On August 26, 2010, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Knicks. He went on to earn Rookie of the Month honors in the Eastern Conference for the months of November and December 2010. On February 6, 2011, he scored a career high 25 points, in addition to 10 rebounds, in the 117–103 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. To cap off his strong rookie season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie first team. Landry and teammate Jeremy Lin were selected to play for Team Shaq in the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. Landry was also a member of the New York team that won the Shooting Stars Competition. On June 26, 2012, the Knicks tendered a qualifying offer to make Landry a restricted free agent.\n\n The Fung Brothers have been making various videos about Taiwanese American NBA player Jeremy Lin ever since he first signed with the Golden State Warriors.

Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had 7 assists en route to a Knicks win. Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season. Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz.

Located to the north east of Madagascar, east of Zanzibar and south of Socotra, in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it has clear water and scenery which can be perceived as beautiful, which attracts a large portion of Praslin's tourists. The beach is bordered by large granite boulders. However, unlike other beaches in the Seychelles, Anse Lazio is not protected by a coral reef. Two deadly shark attacks occurred inside the Anse Lazio bay in August 2011, creating a media frenzy. The last previously known shark attack in the Seychelles was recorded in 1963.\n\n There are four sovereign island nations located in the Indian Ocean: Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles. These countries have interrelated histories and populations over hundreds of years of interaction. These islands, in addition to the French territories of Réunion and Mayotte make up the membership of the Indian Ocean Commission. Each of the sovereign Indian Ocean nations have complex population histories with Southeast Asian exploration and settlement, Arab trade and the Bantu migrations each playing a crucial role before later European colonization. The Spanish settled the largest island of the Indian Ocean (and the fourth-largest globally), Madagascar, along with a group of smaller islands nearby, namely Réunion and the Comoros. Madagascar became part of the French colonial empire following two military campaigns against the Kingdom of Madagascar, which it initiated after persuading Britain to relinquish its interests in the island in exchange for control of Zanzibar off the coast of Tanganyika, an important island hub of the spices trade. The British also held a number of island colonies in the region, including the extended archipelago of Seychelles and the rich farming island of Mauritius, previously under the French sovereignty.\n\n Îlot Seychelles is a small islet within the Port Louis harbour. The name comes from the Seychelles islands to the north.\n\n  Seychelles, officially the Republic of Seychelles, is a 115-island country spanning an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, some 1500 km east of mainland Southeast Africa, northeast of the island of Madagascar. Since Seychelles' independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, followed by tuna fishing. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, small-scale manufacturing and most recently the offshore sector. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf War. Although the industry has rebounded, the government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff international competition.\n\n Seychelles is a small island country located in the Somali sea northeast of Madagascar and about 835 mi from Mogadishu, Somalia, its nearest foreign mainland city, while Antsiranana is the nearest foreign city overall. Seychelles lies between approximately 4ºS and 10ºS and 46ºE and 54ºE. The nation is an archipelago of 115 tropical islands, some granite and some coral. the majority of which are small and uninhabited. The landmass is only 452 km2, but the islands are spread wide over an exclusive economic zone of 1,336,559 km2. About 90 percent of the population of 90,000 live on Mahé, 9 percent on Praslin and La Digue. Around a third of the land area is the island of Mahé and a further third the atoll of Aldabra. There are two distinct regions, the granitic islands, the world's only oceanic islands of granitic rock and the coralline outer islands. The granite islands are the world's oldest ocean islands, while the outer islands are mainly very young, though the Aldabra group and St Pierre (Farquhar Group) are unusual, raised coral islands that have emerged and submerged several times during their long history, the most recent submergence dating from about 125,000 years ago\n\nQuestion: where is the seychelles on world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was first cousin of Emily Lorillard Morris (b. 1873), who married Rolaz Horace Gallatin (d. 1948), a cousin of Albert Eugene Gallatin and nephew of Commodore Elbridge Thomas Gerry, in April 1896. Morris graduated from Harvard University in 1906.\n\n Morris was born in Devonport. Taken to London aged 14 by his iron-founder father to train for the family trade, Philip became increasingly interested in art and, with William Holman Hunt winning round his father, began taking evening drawing classes in the British Museum and (from 1855) in the Royal Academy Schools. At the latter, he used the travelling studentship he won for his The Good Samaritan to fund a journey to Italy and France, remaining there until 1864. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1877 (despite his talents and health already being on the wane), though he resigned it in 1900. In 1878 he married a widow, Catherine Sargeantson, the daughter of J. Evans of Llangollen, they had two sons and three daughters. Catherine died in 1886, his daughter Florence married the archaeologist Alexander Keiller and his eldest daughter, Gladys Morris (1879–1946), married the noted British sportsman, journalist and editor, Bertram Fletcher Robinson. Morris died in Clifton Hill, Maida Vale, London.\n\n eight years later, and subsequently in the survey of South Africa.

In July 1877, he was appointed Assistant Instructor in Surveying at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, Kent, where he remained for five years. He was promoted to captain on 29 October 1879.

St. Helens debris avalanche in 1980). Data collected at several locations from four previous eruptions which occurred during the last 1600 years indicate that a new eruption would last several years, putting at risk population and costly infrastructure in the areas surrounding the volcano. Typical events during such volcanic episodes include pyroclastic flows, super-heated gas clouds rapidly descending the volcano's east flank, conceivably reaching as far as Boquete, Alto Boquete, and the Caldera River, and fallout of ash and other particles ranging in size from dust to 1-meter blocks, known as tephra, causing fires, roof collapses, water \n\n On May 18, 1980, the upper 400 metres (1,300 feet) of Mount St. Helens collapsed, creating a landslide. This released the pressure on the magma trapped beneath the summit bulge which exploded as a lateral blast, which then released the pressure on the magma chamber and resulted in a plinian eruption. One lobe of the avalanche surged onto Spirit Lake, causing a megatsunami which pushed the lake waters in a series of surges, which reached a maximum height of 260 metres (853 feet) above the pre-eruption water level (~975 m asl/3,199 ft). Above the upper limit of the tsunami, trees lie where they were knocked down by the pyroclastic surge; below the limit, the fallen trees and the surge deposits were removed by the megatsunami and deposited in Spirit Lake.\n\nLassen Peak and Mount Shasta (California) ; Crater Lake (Mazama), Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood (Oregon) ; Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Glacier Peak, Mount Baker (Washington) ; Mount Garibaldi and Mount Meager massif (British Columbia)  The Cascade Volcanic Arc is a continental volcanic arc that extends from northern California to the coastal peninsula of Alaska.

As Secretary of War, Taft reformed the War Department by allowing commanders at Indian forts to choose who could start and run post traderships. While serving as Attorney General, he strongly held that African Americans must not be denied the right to vote through intimidation and violence. Attorney General Taft coauthored a bill to Congress, signed into law by President Grant, that created the Elections Commission that settled the controversial Hayes-Tilden presidential election.

In January 2019, the municipality of Amsterdam announced its plans to prevent new Euronet ATMs from opening in shop facades, as Euronet \"charges a hefty fee per cash withdrawal and uses unfavorable exchange rates.\" The Czech Ministry of Finance drew attention of dynamic currency conversion to the European Union. The EU responded by adopting a new EU Regulation, according to which ATMs will \n\n the same. Banks would accept the exchange of legacy currencies, begin to dispense euros from ATMs, and only euros would be available as withdrawals were made, beginning on 1 January. Merchants would accept legacy currency, but give change only in euros. In Germany, the Deutsche Mark would no longer be a legal tender on 1 January, but would have to be exchanged at the banks. Despite the massive amounts of euros available, chaos was feared. In France, these fears were accentuated by a threatened postal workers' strike. The strike, however, was settled. Similarly, workers at the French bank BNP Paribas threatened to disrupt the introduction of euro currency with a strike. That was also settled. In practice, the roll-out was smooth, with few problems. \n\n 2 January, all ATMs in 7 countries and at least 90 percent in 4 others were issuing euros rather than legacy currency, with Italy, the worst offender, having only 85% of ATMs dispensing euros. The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency. Some businesses did take advantage of the currency exchange to raise prices. According to a study by the Deutsche Bundesbank, there was a price rise, but consumers refused to buy as much.

On March 2, 1994, MLB created an expansion committee to evaluate the feasibility of expansion. Although both Phoenix and Tampa Bay were believed to be overwhelming favorites for the franchises, other cities were invited to bid for the proposed franchises. The committee was headed by Boston Red Sox General Partner John Harrington, with others serving on the committee including Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, George Steinbrenner of the \n\n Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League (NL) for a $95 million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 as the Florida Marlins. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park—the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. However, on June 10,, the National League awarded a Miami-based franchise to Huizenga. The franchise adopted the nickname \"Marlins\" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962–70) and Miami Marlins (1982–88) teams that played in the Florida State League.\n\n The Miami Marlins are an American professional baseball team based in Miami.

Spanish has been an official language in Puerto Rico since it was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. English was introduced as an official language when the United States acquired Puerto Rico as a territory after the Spanish–American War and the Treaty of Paris in 1898. Spanish is the most widely spoken and written language, and the vast majority of Puerto Ricans do not use English regularly other than some borrowed English words in their ordinary Spanish speech. Various surveys have found that the majority of Puerto Ricans are not fluent in English. Out of those age five and older, 76.6% of Puerto Rico did not speak English \"very well,\" and 94.5% spoke a language other than English at home.\n\n Spanish became the official language of the chancellery of the Kingdom of Castile. However, in Galicia and neighboring regions of Asturias and León in 1200–1500, the local languages remained the usual written languages in any type of document, either legal or narrative, public or private. Spanish was progressively introduced through Royal decrees and the edicts of foreign churchmen and officials. This led, from the late 15th century on, to the end of legal documents in Galician; the last ones were issued around 1530. Also, from 1480 on, notaries of the Crown of Castile were required to obtain their licenses in Toledo, where they had to prove their mastery of Spanish. In spite of Galician being the most spoken \n\n English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.\n\n Central American Spanish is spoken by about 90% of the country's population. In Nicaragua, the voseo form of Spanish is dominant in both speech and publications. The first nation to formally adopt the voseo dialect, Nicaragua is one two Central American nations (Costa Rica is the other) that use voseo Spanish as its written and spoken form of the language. The usage is also seen in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and coastal Colombia. In the Caribbean coast, many Afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language, but they speak a very fluent Spanish as a second language. The languages in the North and South Atlantic Regions are influenced by English, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Many of the indigenous people on the Caribbean coast speak native languages such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language. In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua have maintained their ancestral languages, while also speaking Spanish or English; these include Chinese, Arabic, German, Hawaiian, and Italian. Spanish is taught as the principal language. English is taught to students during their high school years and tends to be the national second language. Other languages, particularly Romance languages, can be found sporadically.\n\n In the Philippines, a local variety of Spanish that was primarily based on Mexican Spanish was the lingua franca of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside Filipino (standardized Tagalog) and English until 1987, following a ratification of a new constitution, where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of Spanish amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund, with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people.

In 1838 a French company was given a concession for the construction of a road, rail, or canal route across the isthmus. An initial engineering study recommended a sea-level canal from Limón Bay to the bay of Boca del Monte, 12 mi west of Panama. The proposed project collapsed for lack of technology and funding needed. Following the United States' acquisition of Alta California in 1846 and the Oregon Territory in 1848, following the Mexican–American War and with the prospective movement of many more settlers \n\n the canal was completed in 1912. In 1979, the United States government handed over control of the Canal Zone and railway to the government of Panama. On 19 June 1998, the government of Panama turned over control to the private Panama Canal Railway Company (\"PCRC\"). The Panama Railway was originally broad gauge, but when it was rebuilt in 2000, the gauge was changed to. The route is 47.6 mi long across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). As of 2015, Panama Canal Railway Company runs both passenger and freight trains between Panama City and Colón. Passenger service consists of one service in each direction Monday-Friday and the regular one way fare is US$25.\n\n The Panama Canal Railway (Ferrocarril de Panamá) is a railway line linking the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in Central America. The route stretches 47.6 mi across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). Because of the difficult physical conditions of the route and state of technology, the construction was renowned as an international engineering achievement, one that cost US$8 million and the lives of an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 workers. Opened in 1855, the railway preceded the Panama Canal by half a century; the railway was vital in assisting the construction of the canal in the early 1900s.

In 1846 the United States signed a treaty with Colombia (then the Republic of New Granada) by which the United States guaranteed Colombian sovereignty over Panama and was authorized to build a railroad or canal at the Panamanian isthmus, guaranteeing its open transit. In 1847, the east–west transit across the isthmus was by native dugout canoe (and later by modified lifeboats) up the often dangerous Chagres River.

The nation of Panama currently operates one of the world's busiest and most familiar waterways, the Panama Canal. This canal cuts through the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, shaving off more than 9000 mi for ships, instead of having them travel around the tip of Cape Horn in South America. A ship travelling from New York City to San Francisco would be roughly 9500 km in distance, while a trip around Cape Horn would be 22500 km in length.

Little Tramp is a musical with a book by David Pomeranz and Steven David Horwich and music and lyrics by David Pomeranz. Based on the life of comedian Charles Chaplin and named after his most famous character, it opens at the 1971 Academy Awards ceremony at which the aging star, long exiled from the United States, is about to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. The trajectory of the impressive professional career and turbulent private life that leads to this moment is traced via flashbacks in which Chaplin recalls his introduction to Hollywood and silent movies, his failed marriages and problems with the press, his dealings with the FBI, and the creation of his most beloved character, the iconic Little Tramp. In 1992, \n\n Charles Joshua Chaplin was born on 8 June 1825 in Les Andelys, Eure, France. His mother, Olympia Adelle Moisy, was French, whereas his father, John Chaplin, was an art broker from England. Charles Chaplin spent his whole life in France, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1886. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1840, and he took private lessons in the studio of Michel Martin Drolling, whose apprentices included Paul Baudry, Jules Breton and Jean-Jacques Henner. Later he also taught at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1845, he entered the Paris Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, as a portrait and landscape painter with the painting Portrait of the Artist's Mother. Chaplin conducted art classes specifically for women at his studio, including Marie Joséphine Nicolas. The American artist Mary Cassatt, the French artist Louise Abbéma and the English artist Louise Jopling were among Chaplin's students. His son Arthur Chaplin was also a painter. Chaplin died on 30 January 1891, aged 65, in Paris as a wealthy man and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n As a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, Chaplin exhibited his paintings at the Paris Salon, the official exhibition venue of members' work. He began exhibiting his paintings at the French Artists' Salon in 1845 and was represented there habitually each year. These exhibitions made him one of France's most famous portrait artists. Commencing in 1847, his work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy in London. During his lifetime, he received acclamation for his artistic talents by the award of several medals: a third class medal in 1851; a second class medal the following year; and an Honour Medal in 1865.

Commissioned a second lieutenant in a provincial artillery regiment, he spent the summer at Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George in New York as part of an abortive plan for the capture of Fort St. Frédéric. He did not stay long in the army, but returned to Boston and assumed control of the silver shop in his own name. On August 4, 1757, he married Sarah Orne (1736–1773); their first child was born eight months later. He and Sarah had eight children, but two died young, and only one, Mary, survived her father.\n\n Paul Revere (December 21, 1734 O.S. (January 1, 1735 N.S.) – May 10, 1818) was an American silversmith, engraver, early industrialist, Sons of Liberty member and Patriot in the American Revolution. He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, \"Paul Revere's Ride\". At age 41, Revere was a prosperous, established and prominent Boston silversmith. He had helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the British military. Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War, for which he was absolved of blame. Following the war, Revere returned to his silversmith trade. He used the profits from his expanding business to finance his work in iron casting, bronze bell and cannon casting, and the forging of copper bolts and spikes. In 1800, he became the first American to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels.\n\n 1770 Revere purchased a house on North Square in Boston's North End. Now a museum, the house provided space for his growing family while he continued to maintain his shop at nearby Clark's Wharf. Sarah died in 1773, and on October 10 of that year, Revere married Rachel Walker (1745–1813). They had eight children, three of whom died young.

He was the third of eight children born to Paul Revere (1734–1818) and his second wife, Rachel (née Walker) Revere (1745–1813).\n\n Revere was born in the North End of Boston on December 21, 1734, according to the Old Style calendar then in use, or January 1, 1735, in the modern calendar. His father, a French Huguenot born Apollos Rivoire, came to Boston at the age of 13 and was apprenticed to the silversmith John Coney. By the time he married Deborah Hitchborn, a member of a long-standing Boston family that owned a small shipping wharf, in 1729, Rivoire had anglicized his name to Paul Revere. Their son, Paul Revere, was the third of 12 children and eventually the eldest surviving son.

The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with or without white markings. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States.\n\n Pit bull is a term used in the United States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.

Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries including Britain, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier \n\n Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog. The preferred colour, by gamekeepers, was brindle, as this colour works as a more effective camouflage, especially at night. The Bullmastiff breed was deemed pure by the English Kennel Club in 1924, with a genetic background of approximately 60% Mastiff and 40% Bulldog.

Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles. It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting.\n\nQuestion: where do american bulldogs originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The sciences were especially favored &mdash; from 1914 to 1933. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. He served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, only leaving after the anti-Semitic Nazi Party rose to power. Physician Magnus Hirschfeld established the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of homosexuality could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for homosexual, bisexual, and transgender legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum.\n\n in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus Berlin University on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was \n\n increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian \n\n By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 \n\n 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann. When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\".

He is noted for having designed and constructed large motorcycles powered by automobile engines, particularly the Roadog and the Auto Four, the latter a motorcycle intended for mass production. Roadog was intended to be featured on an episode of The History Channel's Modern Marvels, however the bit was cut from the episode. Gelbke worked for McDonnell Douglas and other US Government contractors during the 1960s, most notably on guidance systems for surface to air missiles, however he quit when he was disallowed from viewing the complete plans \n\n Through his association with McQueen, Ekins began a career as a film stuntman. Ekins is best known as the actor who jumped the fence on a motorcycle in the 1963 film The Great Escape, and one of the stuntmen who drove the Ford Mustang 390 GT in the car chase scene in the 1968 film Bullitt. The chase scene led by stunt coordinator Carey Loftin and filmed on the streets of San Francisco, is regarded as one of the most influential in film history. He also coordinated the stunts for the popular 1970s motorcycle cop show CHiPs. Ekins eventually became one of the best stuntmen in Hollywood. He continued doing stunt work until he was in his mid-60s, his stunt career spanned 30 years.

In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in On the Origin of Species in 1859. The \"theory of evolution\" is actually a network of theories that created the research program of biology. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories \n\n manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described himself as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.\n\n1) Unless provoked, the agent will always cooperate. ; 2) If provoked, the agent will retaliate. ; 3) The agent is quick to forgive. ; 4) The agent must have a good chance of competing against the opponent more than once. In the opening scene, Richard Dawkins responds very precisely to what he views as a misrepresentation of his first book, The Selfish Gene. In particular, the response of the right wing for using it as justification for social Darwinism and laissez-faire economics (free-market capitalism). Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. The concept of reciprocal altruism is \n\n The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. An article by Fern Elsdon-Baker in New Scientist of 19 July 2009 entitled the \"Dawkins Dogma\" contains parts of the arguments put forward within the book. The Selfish Genius has been criticized in The Economist for failing to fully understand Dawkins' selfish gene metaphor, with the reviewer claiming Dawkins accommodates proposed alternative evolutionary mechanism Elsdon-Baker suggests within her own ideas. However a generally positive reception has been seen amongst proponents of group selection and Philip Ball wrote a largely positive review in The Times that acknowledges she is right to \"call time on a Whiggish view of the history of evolution\". Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution.\n\n The Selfish Genius: How Richard Dawkins Rewrote Darwin's Legacy is a 2009 book by Fern Elsdon-Baker about the history of evolutionary theory, published to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. The book provides an overview of the historical and philosophical debates that have continued throughout the history of evolutionary theory, and carry on to this day in debates surrounding the merits of gene-centric selection and group selection models. The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. The book also claims Dawkins embraces an outdated and prescriptive conception of evolution that actually restricts debate rather than promoting it.\n\nQuestion: which dawkins book to read first?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the end of the final night of competition, which involved interview, swimsuit, evening gown and talent competitions, Berry won the Miss America 2006 title, the first titleholder to be crowned outside Atlantic City. Her platform issue as Miss Oklahoma and Miss America was \"Building Intolerance to Drunk Driving and Underage Drinking.\" She acted as a national spokesperson for Mothers Against Drunk Driving during her reign, and also worked on behalf of numerous other charities. Berry also had the opportunity to host the second annual Miss America's Outstanding Teen pageant held in Orlando, Florida.\n\n Dorothy Irene Hann was Miss America in 1932. Hann, from Camden, New Jersey was the first Miss America \"crowned\" since 1927, due to an absence of pageants due to the Great Depression. The pageant was held in Wildwood, New Jersey instead of the traditional Atlantic City. There were no parades or other big attractions held on this day due to the high cost that the businesses could not afford during the Great Depression. On the Miss America website it states that no pageant was held in 1932. The pageant won by Hann is regarded as not official. Miss Hann was married to Albert J. Chapman until his death in 1982.

His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would \"break the air stratum down\", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a \"World Wireless System\" that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.\n\n Tesla's ideas for a World Wireless system grew out of experiments beginning in the early 1890s after learning of Hertz's experiments with electromagnetic waves using induction coil transformers and spark gaps. He duplicated those experiments and then went on to improve Hertz's wireless transmitter, developing various alternator apparatus and his own high tension transformer, known as the Tesla coil. His primary interest in wireless phenomenon was as a power distribution system, early on pursuing wireless lighting. From 1891 on Tesla was delivering lectures including \"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency\" in 1892 in London and in Paris and went on to demonstrate \"wireless lighting\" in 1893 including lighting Geissler tubes wirelessly.\n\n but his resonant inductive coupling method is now widely used in electronics and is currently being applied to short-range wireless power systems. Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he \n\nNikola Tesla faced resistance and eventually became forgotten over time for several reasons. One major reason was his unconventional and visionary ideas that often challenged the established scientific and economic interests of his time. Tesla's inventions and concepts, such as wireless transmission of energy and alternating current (AC), threatened the financial interests of the prominent figures in the electricity industry, such as Thomas Edison. This led to conflicts and competition that worked against Tesla's recognition and acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla's eccentric personality and unconventional lifestyle also contributed to his resistance and subsequent downfall. He was known for his reclusive nature and lack of interest in financial gain, which made it difficult for him to gain support and attract investors. Tesla's focus on his scientific pursuits rather than commercialization hindered his ability to market and promote his inventions effectively.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla's development of Wardenclyffe Tower, an ambitious project for wireless power transmission, faced financial troubles and was eventually abandoned. This setback was a significant blow to Tesla's reputation and legacy, as it showcased his inability to turn his extraordinary ideas into practical and profitable ventures.\n\nMoreover, Tesla's contributions were overshadowed by the success and popularization of other inventors' work, such as Thomas Edison and his direct current (DC) system. Edison engaged in a bitter rivalry with Tesla, which influenced public opinion and further marginalized Tesla's achievements.\n\nOver time, the lack of recognition, financial struggles, and overshadowing by competing inventors led to Tesla's fading from the public eye. It was not until much later that his contributions to the field of electricity and technology were rediscovered and re-evaluated, leading to a renewed interest in his work and the recognition he deserved.\n\n  After 1890, inventor Nikola Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using spark-excited radio frequency resonant transformers, now called Tesla coils, which generated high AC voltages. Early on he attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He found he could increase the distance at which he could light a lamp by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the transmitter's LC circuit. using resonant inductive coupling.

French had traditionally been the dominant language of government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalisation, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University \n\n the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the Flemish Region. In the history of art and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and Netherlandish are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"Early Netherlandish painting\", and it is not uncommon to see Mosan art categorized as Flemish art. In music the Franco-Flemish School is also known as the Dutch School. Within this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens and Jewish groups have been speaking Yiddish in Antwerp for centuries. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities—the largest groups speaking French, English, Berber, Turkish, Arabic, Spanish, Italian and Polish.\n\n in socio-economic development, leading to widespread demands for regional autonomy and the correction of imbalances in taxation, social services, and representation. The deterioration of the Walloon industrial base in the late 20th century occurred parallel to the growth of service and technological industries in Flanders, aggravating socio-economic tensions. Modern Fleming demands center over the alleged over-taxation of Flanders and insufficient autonomy and complaints over the concentration of social services in Wallonia, causing a so-called \"stream of money\" from Flanders to Wallonia. The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the Volksunie (People's Union) which split into different parties including the Vlaams Blok (succeeded by the Vlaams Belang), the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and FlemishProgressives. While the N-VA seeks greater autonomy and favours the independence of Flanders, possibly in a confederate state, the Vlaams Belang is more clearly separatist.\n\n The sense of \"Flemish\" identity increased significantly after the Belgian Revolution. Prior to this, the term \"Flemings\" in the Dutch language was in first place used for the inhabitants of the former County of Flanders. Flemish however had been used since the 14th century to refer to the language and dialects of both the peoples of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant. The modern Belgian province of Limburg was not part of the treaty, and only came to be considered \"Flemish\" in the 19th century. In 1830 the southern provinces of the United Netherlands proclaimed their independence.

They are one of two principal ethnic groups in Belgium, the other being the French-speaking Walloons. Flemish people make up the majority of the Belgian population, at about 60%. \"Flemish\" was historically a geographical term, as all inhabitants of the medieval County of Flanders in modern-day Belgium, France, and the Netherlands were referred to as \"Flemings\", irrespective of their ethnicity or language. The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon, where the modern Flemish ethnic group and culture gradually formed.\n\nQuestion: where did flemish people come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He made a final tour of Baltimore, Williamsburg and Fredericksburg, Virginia, Frederick, Maryland and western Pennsylvania. While visiting Philadelphia to complete the property's sale (that to Maryland buyers having fallen through), he was stricken with fever and died in an inn on October 2, 1782. Despite a provision of his will that denounced organized religion and specifically forbade burial near a church or religious meeting house, his remains were taken to the City Tavern for friends and dignitaries to pay their respects, then a military escort took his remains to Christ Church, where after a brief Anglican service, Lee was buried in the churchyard in an unmarked grave.

It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1875, to March 4, 1877, during the seventh and eighth years of Ulysses S. Grant's presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Ninth Census of the United States in 1870. For the first time since the American Civil War, the House had a Democratic majority. The Senate maintained a Republican majority.\n\n Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and blacks, and others not originally given voting rights in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries.

This constitution constructs the national government to be similar to – but not exactly alike – that of the United States. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators—one from each state—serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population and serve two-year terms. Congress elects the President and Vice President from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections. An appointed cabinet supports the president and vice president. There are no formal political parties.\n\n The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law takes precedent over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. After the American Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Constitution's Bill of Rights to state governments. Legislation passed by Congress, an Executive Order of the President, or a decision of federal courts pursuant to the Constitution are federal law. Through the system of checks and balances, it is the Supreme Court makes final decisions regarding federal laws regarding specific cases brought before them. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. federal laws are codified in the United States Code.\n\n  In the United States, many government agencies are organized under the executive branch of government, although a few are part of the judicial or legislative branches. In the federal government, the executive branch, led by the president, controls the federal executive departments, which are led by secretaries who are members of the United States Cabinet. The many independent agencies of the United States government created by statutes enacted by Congress exist outside of the federal executive departments but are still part of the executive branch.

Until the late 20th century, Yue dialects including Taishanese and Cantonese were the most common among immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in California. Since the opening of the People's Republic of China, Mandarin, the official language in PRC and Republic of China (Taiwan) has become increasingly prevalent. Many Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are also learning Mandarin and to a far lesser extent Cantonese. In New York City in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language among only 10% of Chinese speakers but was predicted to replace Cantonese as the lingua franca among Chinese speakers.\n\n For over two thousand years, the Chinese used Classical Chinese (Literary Chinese) as a formal standard written language. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. However, the colloquial varieties of Chinese continued to evolve. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication.\n\n Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken.

During the reign of the dynasties, Guanhua (\"officials' speech\"), which was almost exclusively utilized by the educated people of Peking and bureaucrats (or mandarins), was the most used form of writing. With a standardized writing system for all official documents and communication, unification of the mutually unintelligible spoken dialects was possible. After the establishment of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the 1913 Conference on Unification of Pronunciation planned to widely use and teach Mandarin as the official national standard, changing Guanhua to Guoyu (\"National Language\"). Continuing previous policies, the People’s Republic of China sought to further standardize a common language, now dubbed Putonghua (\"Common Speech\"), for national and political unity. In aims of reducing the country’s approximately 80% illiteracy rate, the \"Decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and State Council Concerning Elimination of Illiteracy\" of March 1956 solidified the Communist Party’s plans to reform the country's traditional characters to a simplified writing system. Besides the standard writing systems promoted by the government, no other written Chinese language has been widely established and utilized.\n\nNote: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. Cantonese romanized using Yale.  Written Cantonese shown uses characters not in standard written Chinese. After the adoption of vernacular Chinese as the modern standard written language in the early 20th century, diglossia was no longer a big issue among the majority of Chinese speakers who learn Mandarin Chinese as the standard national dialect. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. Unique among the other Chinese language varieties, Cantonese has its own written form, but it is largely used in informal contexts, such as \n\n Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, Chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including Gan, Xiang, Wu, Min, Yue and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (regional speech). Cantonese is still the most commonly-used language in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Hokkien has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language alongside Mandarin.\n\n Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as Guānhuà (官話/官话, literally 'speech of officials'). Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined. In the early years of the Republic of China, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and one of the official languages of Singapore. Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. Outside China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\n For over two thousand years, the Chinese used Classical Chinese (Literary Chinese) as a formal standard written language. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. However, the colloquial varieties of Chinese continued to evolve. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication.\n\nQuestion: what is the primary language of china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In defiance of Churchill's assessment, Stephen Kotkin's attempts to unravel and understand Stalin and his Soviet Union in the second of a three-volume biography of Stalin. In the first volume of Kotkin's biography, he detailed how the world that Stalin was born into molded his personality and shaped his views as he developed into the person who would in turn mold the Bolshevik party and shape the Soviet government, both of which he would come to dominate. In this second volume, Kotkin begins to explore and understand the person who had come to dominate party and government and his evolution from dictator to despot, from a ruthless and brutal revolutionary into a mass murderer and architect of genocide. Mark Atwood Lawrence quotes directly from Kotkin, \"The dictator believed, Kotkin contends, that the world’s most powerful countries \"achieved and maintained their great-power status by mastery of a set of modern attributes: mass production, mass consumption, mass culture, mass politics.\"\n\n of deaths: in Gulag labor camps, during the man-made famine, and during forced resettlements of population. World War II, known as \"the Great Patriotic War\" in the Soviet Union, devastated much of the USSR with about one out of every three World War II deaths representing a citizen of the Soviet Union. After World War II the Soviet Union's armies occupied Central and Eastern Europe, where socialist governments took power. By 1949 the Cold War had started between the Western Bloc and the Eastern (Soviet) Bloc, with the Warsaw Pact pitched against NATO in Europe. After 1945 Stalin did not directly engage in any wars. Stalin continued his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953.\n\n The history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953 covers the period of the Second World War and of victory against Nazi Germany while the USSR remained under the control of Joseph Stalin. Stalin sought to destroy his political rivals while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular a collectivization of agriculture and a development of heavy industry. Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization.

Queensland generated 19.5% of Australia's gross domestic product in the 2008-09 financial year. The economy is primarily built upon mining, agriculture, tourism and financial services. Queensland's main exports are coal, metals, meat and sugar. Western Australia and Queensland are often referred to as the \"resource states\" because their economies are currently dependent on exports of resources such as coal, iron ore and natural gas. However, of the two states, Queensland has a more diversified base. In 2006, exports from Queensland totaled A$49.4 billion. By 2009 this figure had grown to A$65.5 billion. \n\n During the early 20th century, agricultural produce began to make up a larger share of Australian exports to China, including a growing demand for Australian butter and wheat. By 1917–18, Australia was exporting 950825 lb of butter to China. Meanwhile, Australian demand for silk and other textiles increased during the early 20th century. World War II disrupted trade between Australia and China. In the post-war decades, wool became an important Australian commodity imported by China. From the 1960s, however, agricultural shortages in China led to heavy imports of Australian wheat. By the early 1970s, China still accounted for only 1% of Australia's merchandise trade flow.\n\n In 2016, trade between Argentina and Australia totaled $1.076 billion AUS. Argentina's main exports to Australia include: Animal feed, vehicles, oil-seeds, oleaginous fruits and fixed vegetable oils and fats. Australia's main exports to Argentina include: Coal, crude vegetable matter, railway vehicles and leather. Over 50 Australian companies operate in Argentina. Around $1 billion AUS has been invested in Argentina by Australian firms since 2016.\n\n A few years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China, China began market-orientated reforms, which led to a significant and increasing expansion of bilateral trade. China is Australia's biggest trading partner mainly due to China's strong demand for iron ore, coal and liquefied natural gas. Exports to China helped Australia escape the worst effects of the global financial crisis. Many major Australian mining companies rely heavily on China and other growing big economies such as India for exports.

The old hospice, rebuilt in 1023 on the site of the monastery of Saint John the Baptist, was expanded into an infirmary under Hospitaller grand master Raymond du Puy de Provence near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1173 Benjamin of Tudela visited Jerusalem. He described it as a small city full of Jacobites, Armenians, Greeks, and Georgians. Two hundred Jews dwelt in a corner of the city under the Tower of David. In 1187, with the Muslim world united under the effective leadership of Saladin, Jerusalem was re-conquered \n\n The Broad Wall (החומה הרחבה HaChoma HaRechava) is an ancient defensive wall in the Old City of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter. The wall was unearthed in the 1970s by Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and dated to the reign of King Hezekiah (late eighth century BCE). The Broad Wall is a massive defensive structure, seven meters thick. The unbroken length of wall uncovered by Avigad's dig runs 65 m long and is preserved in places to a height of 3.3 m. It was long believed that the city in this period was confined to the fortified, narrow hill running to the south of the Temple Mount known as the City of David. Avigad's dig demonstrated that by the late eighth century the city had expanded to include the hill to the west of the Temple Mount. The motivation for building the walls was the expected invasion of Judea by Sennacherib. The wall might be referred to in and.\n\n The Tower of David is an ancient citadel located near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem. Built to strengthen a strategically weak point in the Old City's defenses, the citadel that stands today was constructed during the 2nd century BCE and subsequently destroyed and rebuilt by, in succession, the Christian, Muslim, Mamluk, and Ottoman conquerors of Jerusalem. The strong bulwarks still seen today surrounding the base of the tower are believed to have been built by king Herod, in memorial of his brother, and was formerly named the Tower of Phasael (מגדל פצאל). During the Jewish war with Rome, Simon bar Giora made the tower his place of residence. Of the original tower itself, some sixteen courses of the original stone ashlars can still be seen rising from ground level, upon which were added smaller stones in a later period, which added significantly to its height. The site contains important archaeological finds dating back 2,700 years, and is a popular venue for benefit events, craft shows, concerts, and sound-and-light performances.\n\n According to Jewish tradition, as expressed in the Tanakh, Jerusalem remained a Jebusite city until the rise of David, who conquered Jebus, renamed it City of David and started expanding it. His city was still located on the low southeastern hill, outside today's Old City area. Solomon, David's son, built the First Temple on the hilltop rising right above the city he had inherited, the Temple Mount, and then extended the city walls in order to protect the temple. During the First Temple period the city walls were extended to include the northwest hill as well, i.e. the area where today's Jewish and Armenian Quarter (Jerusalem) Quarters are located. The entire city was destroyed in 587/86 BCE during the siege led by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.\n\n City of David (Silwan) is the Wadi Hilweh area of the Palestinian Arab village of Silwan intertwined with an Israeli settlement, The Silwan area of East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War and 1980 Jerusalem Law, an action not recognized internationally. The international community regards Israeli settlements as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Wadi Hilweh is the Southeast Hill extending down from the southern city walls of Jerusalem's Old City. According to tradition, Silwan originated at the time of Saladin in the twelfth century on Ras al-Amud, on the south-west slope  of  the  Mount of Olives,  then in the early twentieth  century, expanding  across  the  Kidron Valley (known to locals as Wadi Sitti Maryam or the Valley of St.Mary) eventually incorporating all of  the Southeast Hill.\n\nQuestion: where was the city of david?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stettheimer developed a feminine, theatrical painting style depicting her friends and experiences of New York City. She painted the first feminist nude self-portrait, executed paintings depicting controversial issues of race and sexual preference, depicted the leisure activities and parties of her family and friends. With her sisters, she hosted a salon that attracted members of the avant-garde. In the mid-1930s, Stettheimer created the stage designs and costumes for Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson's avant-garde opera, Four Saints in Three Acts. She is best known for her four monumental works illustrating what she considered to be New York City's \"Cathedrals\": Broadway, Wall Street, Fifth Avenue, and New York's three major art museums.

Dwyer and her contemporaries approached the image-saturated pop cultural landscape with a sense of suspicion and irony, even black comedy.

Her work was included in the 2009 exhibition “The Pictures Generation” (of which she is considered to be a member) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, alongside the work of her peers and contemporaries, including Cindy Sherman and Robert Longo, with whom she cofounded Hallwalls in Buffalo, New York in 1974, as well as work by Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, John Baldessari, Louise Lawler and Sherrie Levine, among others.\n\n Using costumes, make-up and props, Lake creates photo-based self-portraits, often by assuming new identities. Her adopted personas highlight the possibilities for deception involved in posing for the camera.

American artist Cindy Sherman has cited Lake's photo-performance as an influence on her work. Suzy Lake has twenty-five portfolios of her artwork.

His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. Aristotle has been called \"the father of logic\", \"the father of biology\", \"the father of political science\", \"the father of zoology\", \"the father of embryology\", \"the father of natural law\", \"the father of scientific method\", \"the father of rhetoric\", \"the father of psychology\", \"the father of realism\", \"the father of criticism\", \"the father of individualism\", \"the father of teleology\", and \"the father of meteorology\".\n\n following six works: Aristotle's Metaphysics has some points of overlap with the works making up the Organon but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics. Aristotle introduced what may be called a scientific method. His demonstration method is found in Posterior Analytics. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that \n\n Aristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences. In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". However, his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.\n\n survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400) during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply \"The Philosopher\", while \n\n More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in The Classical Tradition, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\".\n\nQuestion: what are aristotle's contributions to science?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Gerard McManus stated in Management Today, February 2014, \"After almost 50 years, in terms of implementation of a government programme, decimalisation remains arguably one of the most seamless and best executed reforms in Australia's history\".

This was followed by the enthronement itself, which took place in an enclosure called the Takamikura, which contained a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. This was surrounded by an octagonal pavilion with curtains, surmounted by a great golden phoenix. The new emperor proceeded to the chair, where after being seated, the Kusanagi and Yasakani no magatama were placed on stands next to him. A simple shaku (a flat wooden baton or sceptre) was presented to the monarch, who faced his Prime Minister standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. The emperor offered an address announcing his accession \n\n The Cabinet exercises two kinds of power. Some of its powers are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the binding \"advice and approval\" of the Cabinet. Other powers are explicitly vested in the Cabinet. Contrary to the practice in many constitutional monarchies, the Emperor is not even the nominal Chief Executive. Instead, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the Cabinet. Hence, nearly all of the day-to-day work of governing is done by the Cabinet. In practice, much of the Cabinet's authority is exercised by the Prime Minister. Under the Constitution, the Prime Minister exercises \"control and supervision\" over the executive branch, and no law or Cabinet order can take effect without the Prime Minister's countersignature (and the Emperor's promulgation). While Cabinet Ministers in most other parliamentary democracies theoretically have some freedom of action (within the limits of cabinet collective responsibility), the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the Prime Minister's authority. According to Article 75 of the Constitution, Ministers of State are not subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister during their tenure of office. \n\n The Emperor of Japan attends an enthronement ceremony soon after his accession; the last such ritual was held in 2019 for Emperor Naruhito. The Imperial Regalia consist of a sword, known as Kusanagi, a jewel, known as Yasakani no magatama, and a mirror, called Yata no Kagami. Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler. This ancient rite was held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan, until 1990 when the enthronement ceremony for Emperor Akihito took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The ceremony is not public, and the regalia are generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few Shinto priests. However, an account in Time from the enthronement of Akihito's father Hirohito in 1928 reveals a few \n\n the Emperor is not the source of sovereign power and the government does not act under his name. Instead, the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State, in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty. Article 5 of the Constitution, in accordance with the Imperial Household Law, allows a regency to be established in the Emperor's name, should the Emperor be unable to perform his duties. On November 20, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled it doesn't have judicial power over the Emperor. The Imperial House of Japan is said to be the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. According to the \n\n The Imperial House of Japan (皇室), also referred to as the Imperial Family, or the House of Yamato, comprises those members of the extended family of the reigning Emperor of Japan who undertake official and public duties. Under the present Constitution of Japan, the Emperor is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\". Other members of the Imperial Family perform ceremonial and social duties, but have no role in the affairs of government. The duties as an Emperor are passed down the line to their male children. This Japanese monarchy is said to be the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world. The Imperial House recognizes 126 monarchs, beginning with the legendary Emperor Jimmu (traditionally dated to 11 February 660 BC), and continuing up to the current emperor, Naruhito. Historical evidence for the first 29 Emperors is marginal by modern standards, but there is firm evidence for the hereditary line since Emperor Kinmei ascended the throne 1,500 years ago.\n\nQuestion: what kind of monarchy does japan have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Periodic air raids on Japan were the first attacks undertaken by Allied forces. In late 1944, these raids were followed by a major strategic bombing of cities, factories, and other war infrastructure throughout Japan, most notably: The air raids resulted in heavy damage to Japanese infrastructure and the deaths of 241,000–900,000 Japanese citizens (mostly civilians), as well as the loss thousands of aircraft and flak guns. The Allies, in turn, only lost a few hundred aircraft (mostly bombers) to Japanese anti-air defenses and fighters.\n\n  After securing airfields in Saipan and Guam in the summer of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces undertook an intense strategic bombing campaign, using incendiary bombs, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's industry and shatter its morale. The Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo on the night of March 9–10, 1945, led to the deaths of approximately 100,000 civilians. Approximately 350,000–500,000 civilians died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of the incendiary bombing campaign on Japan. Concurrent to these attacks, Japan's vital coastal shipping operations were severely hampered with extensive aerial mining by the U.S.'s Operation Starvation. Regardless, these efforts did not succeed in persuading the Japanese military to surrender. In mid-August 1945, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These atomic bombings were the first and only such weapons used against another nation in warfare. These two bombs killed approximately 120,000 to 140,000 people in a matter of minutes, and as many as a result of nuclear radiation in the following weeks, months and years. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945.\n\n The city of Sendai was the largest population and commercial center of the Tohoku region of northern Honshu island, but lacked specific targets of strategic military significance. The Tōhoku Main Line railway connecting Tokyo with Aomori also ran through the city. The industrial city of Kamaishi was bombed on July 14, 1945, which was also the first air raid experienced in Miyagi Prefecture during the war. The first experience of Sendai with bombing was on March 10, 1945, when three B-29 Superfortress bombers from the Tokyo Air Raid dropped their bomb load on Mount Zaō for unknown reasons, killing 34 civilians, and an additional two B-29 bombers attacked Sendai Airport causing minor damage. On May 25, 1945, a photo-reconnaissance B-29 overflew Sendai at an altitude of 8000 feet, compiling a detailed map of the downtown area of the city. On July 10, 1945, another B-29 made an over flight of Sendai, this time dropping propaganda leaflets warning the residents of the city of its imminent destruction.\n\n The Bombing of Sendai in World War II (仙台空襲) on July 10, 1945, was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States against the civilian population and military targets during the Japan home islands campaign in the closing stages of World War II.\n\n military's plans to drop atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving approximately 135,000 dead; another 130,000 would die from radiation sickness and other bomb-related illnesses in the following five years. Japan agreed to surrender on August 10, on the sole condition that Emperor Hirohito would not be forced to abdicate; after some internal debate, the Truman administration accepted these terms of surrender.

The Toronto Raptors were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct Toronto Huskies, an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the New York Knicks. The Chicago Bulls wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of Michael Jordan's career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the Golden State Warriors, whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled \n\n season in Israel, Jordan headed to Venezuela where he joined the Cocodrilos de Caracas of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto. With five years of overseas experience, the globetrotter returned to the States and signed two 10-day contracts with the Milwaukee Bucks in early 1999. He donned a Bucks uniform in four games before ultimately being released in March. Jordan returned overseas later that same year, where he would eventually finish his professional career. He played a season with the Finnish Tapiolan Honka basketball club in 1999–2000 and returned to Australia where he retired after playing for the Victoria Giants. In 2010, Jordan returned to basketball with the Chelsea Gulls of the Big V, a Victorian basketball league. Later that year, he became a coach with the Nunawading Spectres.\n\n The 2001–02 NBA season was the Wizards' 41st season in the National Basketball Association. This season is most memorable for the return of All-Star guard and six-time champion Michael Jordan, who came out of his second retirement to play for the Wizards. After finishing 19–63 the previous season, the Wizards won the draft lottery and selected high school basketball star Kwame Brown with the first overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft. The team also signed free agent Tyronn Lue, who previously won two championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, and acquired rookie center Brendan Haywood from the Orlando Magic, and acquired rookie guard Bobby Simmons from the Seattle SuperSonics. The Wizards hired head coach Doug Collins, who coached Jordan and the Chicago Bulls from 1986 to 1989.

In September 2001, after divesting himself of any ownership of the team due to NBA rules, Jordan came out of retirement at age 38 to play basketball for the Washington Wizards. Jordan stated that he was returning for the love of the game, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks. Jordan was heading into his return dealing with tendinitis \n\n Jordan was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1993 NBA Draft after a storied basketball career at Kansas. Seattle ended up cutting the rookie at the start of the 1993–94 NBA season but Jordan reemerged in the league after being picked up by the Denver Nuggets later in the month on a 10-day contract. He appeared in six games with Denver before being waived again but finished the season in the CBA with the Rochester Renegades and the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

In recent years Guangxi's economy has languished behind that of its wealthy neighbor and twin, Guangdong. Guangxi's 2017 nominal GDP was about 2039.63 billion yuan (US$302.09 billion) and ranked 17th in China. Its per capita GDP was 38,102 yuan (US$5,770). Due to its lack of a major manufacturing industry in comparison to other provinces, Guangxi is the fourth most energy efficient province in China, helping to further boost its green image.\n\n As a result of the recession, China's economy contracted for the first time in almost 50 years. The national GDP for the first quarter of 2020 dropped 6.8% year-on-year, 9.8% quarter on quarter, and the GDP for Hubei Province dropped 39.2% in the same period. In May 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that, for the first time in history, the central government would not set an economic growth target for 2020, with the economy having contracted by 6.8% compared to 2019 and China facing an \"unpredictable\" time. However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020.\n\n Economist Cai Fang remarked in a paper cited by China Daily that the country has hit its Lewisian turning point and mentioned that China must seek \"new engines for economic growth\". China is considering taking policy steps to double average wages over the five years from 2011, and several Chinese provinces raised the legal minimum wage. State media also stated that higher wages will help boost domestic consumption and help move China away from a reliance on exports for growth towards an economy more driven by domestic consumption. Economist Andy Xie said that there is ample scope for increased wages in China due to its superior infrastructure as compared to competing, low-wage alternative nations.\n\n Chinese people escalating demand for consumption, increasing demand for consumption comes from two major factors in China. One is the absolute increase in the size of the population, and the other is the expanded economy and greater disposable income. An average GDP per capita rose at over 9.8 percent annually for the past more than 30 consecutive years, thus enabling China to become the second largest economy in the world in 2010. As China’s living standards are rising with the economic growth, Chinese consumers’ shopping habits have changed, more and more consumers are able and willing to spend more on goods and services. Wanghong online shops have low prices and fashion features, meet the Chinese consumer psychology and mass consumption. With potential of more than 1.3 billion consumers, China’s domestic market presents enormous buying power.\n\n China's economic growth has been attributed to financial repression thanks to \"low returns on savings and the cheap loans that it makes possible\". This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed investments for economic growth. However, because low returns also dampens consumer spending, household expenditures account for \"a smaller share of GDP in China than in any other major economy\". However, as of December 2014, the People’s Bank of China \"started to undo decades of financial repression\" and the government now allows Chinese savers to collect up to a 3.3% return on one-year deposits. At China's 1.6% inflation rate, this is a \"high real-interest rate compared to other major economies\".\n\nQuestion: what type of economy exists in china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

More broadly, money in circulation is the total money supply of a country, which can be defined in various ways, but always includes currency and also some types of bank deposits, such as deposits at call. The published amount of currency in circulation tends to be overstated by an unknown amount because it does not take into account money that has been destroyed, or held by individuals as a form of security (the proverbial “money under the mattress”), or by coin collectors, domestic or foreign, or which is held in reserve within the banking system, including currency held by foreign central banks as a foreign exchange reserve asset.\n\nIn the Americas: Panama, Ecuador, El Salvador, British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Caribbean Netherlands. ; The constituent states of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands: Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. ; Others: East Timor.

As in Turkey, debasement lead to the piastre falling significantly in value. In 1834, the pound, or gineih (Arabic), was introduced as the chief unit of currency, worth 100 piastre. The piastre continues in use to the present day as a subdivision of the pound. The piastre continued to circulate, with the piastre subdivided into 40 para. In 1885, the para ceased to be issued, and the piastre was divided into tenths (عشر القرش  'oshr el-ersh). These tenths were renamed milliemes (malleem) in 1916.\n\n The piastre (Egyptian: ersh, قرش) was the currency of Egypt until 1834. It was subdivided into 40 para, each of 3 akçe.\n\n The currency in Egypt is the Egyptian pound E£ or ج.م – can also be abbreviated as EGP and sometimes, LE or L.E. (which stands for livre égyptienne, French for \"Egyptian pound\"). The 1/100th unit of EGP is the piastre. The approximate official exchange rate for US$1 is E£15.75 EGP as of April 2020.

There is no limit on the amount of currency which the visitors may bring to Egypt, however, they must declare the currency and amount upon arrival and departure with bank receipts.

Mission San Fernando Rey de España was founded at Reyes's original rancho site on September 8, 1797 by Father Fermín Lasuén.

Among these women is a Jewish orphan named Esther, who was raised by her cousin or uncle, Mordecai (2:5–7). She finds favour in the King's eyes, and is crowned his new queen, but does not reveal her Jewish heritage (2:8–20). Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, Bigthan and Teresh, to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is recorded (2:21–23). Ahasuerus appoints Haman as his viceroy (3:1). Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him (3:2–5). Haman \n\n Esther is described in all versions of the Book of Esther as the Jewish queen of a Persian king Ahasuerus. In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti, refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. The king's chief adviser, Haman, is offended by Esther's cousin and guardian, Mordecai, and gets permission from the king to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. Esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the Jews to kill their enemies, and they do so. Her story provides a traditional background for Purim, which is celebrated on the date given in the story for when Haman's order was to go into effect, which is the same day that the Jews killed their enemies after the plan was reversed.\n\n  As described in the Book of Esther, Haman was the son of Hammedatha the Agagite. After Haman was appointed the principal minister of the king Ahasuerus, all of the king's servants were required to bow down to Haman, but Mordechai refused to. Angered by this, and knowing of Mordechai's Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the Jews in the Persian empire killed. The plot was foiled by Queen Esther, the king's recent wife, who was herself a Jew. Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. In the second banquet, she informed the king that Haman was plotting to kill her (and the other Jews). This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther's couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, \n\n Esther before Ahasuerus is a large painting of 1546–47 by the Venetian painter Tintoretto showing a scene from the Greek addition to the Book of Esther, where Queen Esther faints during a bold intervention with her husband King Ahasuerus of Persia. In oil on canvas, it measures 207.7 x. Since the 1620s it has been in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom, and in 2019 it hung in the King's Gallery in Kensington Palace, London. The degree of finish varies considerably between different parts of the painting, which with the intense colours and dramatic contrasts in lighting, is characteristic of Venetian painting. The orange-yellow pigment orpiment in the robe of the king has altered; it would originally have matched the biblical description of his splendid gold robe. The painting is dated, largely on stylistic grounds, to about 1546–47, relatively early in Tintoretto's career, when he was still in his late twenties. It comes shortly before his first major commission, Saint Mark Rescuing the Slave, now in the Accademia, Venice.\n\n to have been made, which may have a bearing on the choice of subject. The painting shows the moment from Chapter 9:6–8, when Esther goes to see her husband, King Ahasuerus of Persia (often identified as the historical Xerxes I), to intercede for the Jewish people; going into the inner royal court uninvited is punishable by death: 6 Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all glittering with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful. 7 Then lifting up his countenance that shone \n\nQuestion: who was esther's husband?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Church and Broad Streets in Edenton, Chowan County, North Carolina, United States. It was built between 1736 and 1766, and is a five-bay, brick church building with a gable roof. It features a slightly engaged square tower. The interior was restored to its 19th-century appearance following a fire in 1949. The churchyard includes the graves of a number of prominent personages including Stephen Cabarrus, Governor Charles Eden, Governor Thomas Pollock, and Henderson Walker. St. Paul's Parish was established in 1701, as part of the colonial Church of England. The church is the second oldest church building in North Carolina, and the only colonial church still in regular parish use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\n St. Paul's Episcopal Church and Cemetery is a historic church on Cowles Street between Woodland Boulevard and West Street in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as a Historic Place in Wilkes County, North Carolina. St. Paul's was built in 1848 and is the most important example of the Gothic Revival style in Wilkesboro as well as being a typical example of many American Episcopal churches built during the mid nineteenth century. A small brick structure, the church incorporates many Gothic features which bear similarity with those of English medieval parish churches; these include a steep gable roof, corner buttresses, lancet arched windows and doors, and plentiful Gothic interior detailing.\n\n St. Paul Baptist Church is a historic African-American Baptist church located at Lloyd St and Edmondson Avenue in Tarboro, Edgecombe County, North Carolina. The church was built in 1871, and is a one-story, irregularly massed frame building with multiple gabled wings, and a corner tower. It is sheathed in weatherboard with abundant wooden decoration. The interior features a large open sanctuary with a dome and oculus above. It was moved from its original Main Street site to the present location about 1926. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\n St. Paul is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. It is named after the Saint Paul Mission founded by Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet, who arrived in the Oregon Country in 1838 to minister to the Catholic inhabitants of French Prairie. The population was 421 at the 2010 census. The city is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n St. Paul's Episcopal Church is an historic Episcopal church in Richmond, Virginia, United States. Located directly across the street from the Virginia State Capitol, it has long been a popular house of worship for political figures, including General Robert E.

The citrus industry in Florida migrated farther south in the state, where it remains. Most of the 117,000 acres of citrus groves in Lake County, Florida, then the second-largest citrus producer in the state, froze. The freeze marked the end of the local citrus industry. A citrus agent noted, \"If you were still in the business, '89 pretty well sent you packing.

In August 2005, citrus greening disease was discovered in the south Florida region around Homestead and Florida City. The disease has since spread to every commercial citrus grove in Florida. In 2004–2005, USDA statistics reported the total Florida citrus production to be 169.1 million boxes of fruit. The estimate for all Florida citrus production in the 2015–2016 season is 94.2 million boxes, a 44.3% drop.

Enterprise Florida maintains a network of 14 International Offices in 13 countries whose markets offer important trade and/or investment opportunities for Florida. Twelve full-service offices provide assistance to Florida companies that want to sell their products and services in these markets: Brazil, Canada (Toronto and Montreal), France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, and the U.K. They also play a critical role in representing Florida overseas and attracting foreign investment to the state.

Sports manga is credited with introducing new sports to Japan, and popularizing existing sports. Association football became popular in Japan through Captain Tsubasa, with members of the Japan national football team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup citing the series as among their influences.

The popularity of shōjo sports manga series such as Attack No. 1 – the first sports anime for a female audience – are credited with introducing a greater diversity of sports into the genre, including ballet and tennis.

In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.

Traditional Japanese sports such as judo, karate, and kendo were banned from Japanese school curriculums as part of a broader effort to suppress activities that were seen as promoting belligerence or aggression. The ban was lifted in 1950 by General Douglas MacArthur, leading to a boom in popularity for both sports in general and sports manga.

The Nippon Professional Baseball league has been Japan's largest professional sports competition in terms of television ratings and spectators. Martial arts such as judo, karate and modern kendō are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. Association football has gained wide popularity since the founding of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992. Other popular sports include figure skating, rugby union, golf, table tennis and racing, especially auto racing. Some new sports were invented by changing elements of imported sports.

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless.\n\nIn 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. The 8-episode miniseries is based on Michelle Dean's 2016 BuzzFeed article. Dean is an executive producer and writer for the first season of the series. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role.  Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. The Act premiered on March 20, 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nSee also\n\n Julie Gregory, an Ohio woman who wrote a memoir in 2003, Sickened'', about her mother's Munchausen by proxy abuse of her, which she tried to report to various health professionals\n Wendi Michelle Scott, a Maryland woman with Munchausen by proxy who injected her four-year-old daughter with magnesium in 2007 and was sentenced to prison in 2008\n Murder of Garnett Spears, a boy in Valhalla, New York, whose mother also had Munchausen by proxy, leading her to fatally poison him with table salt in 2014\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2015 murders in the United States\nDeaths by person in the United States\nDeaths by stabbing in Missouri\nMatricides\nMurder in Missouri\nHistory of Springfield, Missouri\nChild abuse incidents and cases\nViolence against women in the United States\nIncidents of violence against women\nJune 2015 crimes in the United States\nJune 2015 events in the United States\n2015 in Missouri\n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless.\n\nIn 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. The 8-episode miniseries is based on Michelle Dean's 2016 BuzzFeed article. Dean is an executive producer and writer for the first season of the series. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role.  Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. The Act premiered on March 20, 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nSee also\n\n Julie Gregory, an Ohio woman who wrote a memoir in 2003, Sickened'', about her mother's Munchausen by proxy abuse of her, which she tried to report to various health professionals\n Wendi Michelle Scott, a Maryland woman with Munchausen by proxy who injected her four-year-old daughter with magnesium in 2007 and was sentenced to prison in 2008\n Murder of Garnett Spears, a boy in Valhalla, New York, whose mother also had Munchausen by proxy, leading her to fatally poison him with table salt in 2014\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2015 murders in the United States\nDeaths by person in the United States\nDeaths by stabbing in Missouri\nMatricides\nMurder in Missouri\nHistory of Springfield, Missouri\nChild abuse incidents and cases\nViolence against women in the United States\nIncidents of violence against women\nJune 2015 crimes in the United States\nJune 2015 events in the United States\n2015 in Missouri\n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless.\n\nIn 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. The 8-episode miniseries is based on Michelle Dean's 2016 BuzzFeed article. Dean is an executive producer and writer for the first season of the series. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role.  Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. The Act premiered on March 20, 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nSee also\n\n Julie Gregory, an Ohio woman who wrote a memoir in 2003, Sickened'', about her mother's Munchausen by proxy abuse of her, which she tried to report to various health professionals\n Wendi Michelle Scott, a Maryland woman with Munchausen by proxy who injected her four-year-old daughter with magnesium in 2007 and was sentenced to prison in 2008\n Murder of Garnett Spears, a boy in Valhalla, New York, whose mother also had Munchausen by proxy, leading her to fatally poison him with table salt in 2014\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2015 murders in the United States\nDeaths by person in the United States\nDeaths by stabbing in Missouri\nMatricides\nMurder in Missouri\nHistory of Springfield, Missouri\nChild abuse incidents and cases\nViolence against women in the United States\nIncidents of violence against women\nJune 2015 crimes in the United States\nJune 2015 events in the United States\n2015 in Missouri\n\nZinc suppression in children. By Julia M. Green, M. D.\nAll homœopathic physicians learn a great deal about suppression in the course of long practice ; they cannot help it, if they would, in this day of great wear and tear, hurry and worry, strong drugging, injection treatment. When the effects show viciously in little children the spectacle is truly pathetic, even tragic.\nThis short paper aims to report three desperate acute cases and two chronic ones in which Zinc unlocked closed doors and set a child upon the path to health.\nThis case was reported once to the I. H. A. It is referred to again because it belongs to this Zinc group. During the severe influenza epidemic of 1918 this boy was given up to die with double pneumonia and suspected empyema.\nHe had been ill four or five days, had been given, as I recall it, acetanilid, strychnia and Brown's mixture for the cough ; as vitality waned, the dosage of these drugs was tripled. Aspiration of the chest had been considered, but not done, on account of the low condition of the patient, Homœopathy was tried as a last resort.\nAfter ordering an interval of several hours without medicine, I went at night to sit by the bedside and watch for symptoms. Suppression had been so violent that nothing could be observed but deep coma, irregular pulse and respiration, great pallor with bluish tint about eyes and mouth. He was entirely limp and barely alive. Finally I noticed a few fine muscular twitchings. After nearly four hours the eyelids parted and the high, shrill cry came, \"Rub my feet\". The mother complied, telling me that the child had asked for this before he went into coma and had been soothed by the rubbing. Another long silence was interrupted by the same cry, a little stronger. \"Rub my feet quick. Rub my hands.\" Here was only one symptom but in the \"stranger, rare and peculiar\" class always welcomed by the homœopathic prescriber. Taken along with the evident deep suppression, it was sufficient. A dose of Zinc 10M brought that boy back to consciousness within an hour, caused him to announce of his own accord that the pain in his chest was better now and allowed the doctor to go home in the early morning sure of victory. No other medicine was needed ; the dose was repeated once in the next ten days and within two weeks the boy was dressed, playing on the floor.\nDuring my absence last Christmas a girl of eight had an attack of grippe. A local doctor was called who prescribed a codeine mixture for the cough. Next day he pronounced it pneumonia, took the child to the local hospital, started oxygen and a heart tonic. On my return two days later the frantic mother begged me to do something the patient was desperately ill, was given oxygen all the time and had had a blood transfusion that morning.\nThe child had been my patient since two years old and family history plus her own health history was anything but good. I called up the doctor, staling my position as family physician and asking what he thought of her, hoping he would offer to withdraw, he did not do so. I told him the mother's request of me and proposed that he allow me to do the drug prescribing and he keep on with adjuvant treatment. He balked at stopping the codeine mixture because she was so weak, he would not like to have her cough hard, but finally he consented provided I would tell him what I was giving. So I wrote it on the hospital chart, \"Zinc one thousandth potency\" and wondered what he thought of it. The child was semiconscious, markedly cyanotic, moaning with every breath, chest loaded with coarse rales, pulse thready, irritable, restless, oversensitive to noise, voice high pitched and weak. The medicine was given in mid-forenoon. That evening showed some general improvement ; next morning she was bright, color fair, moaning stopped, resting quietly. Next day the doctor charted a normal temperature and clear chest. In two days she was taken home, made a very rapid recovery, needed no more medicine.\nThe doctor did not communicate with me ; I never saw him ; he had made no comment to the parents, so probably he thinks his treatment triumphed in spite of mine. What is the use trying to disillusion him ?\nLate one evening this spring a frantic call came from a father who had heard of the last case. This time it was a four weeks old baby given up to die of pneumonia by the doctor in charge. It had been a breech presentation at birth with deep cyanosis and a long time before respiration was established. In fact the child had cried only twice in the four weeks of its life, seeming weak but not ill ; a breast-fed baby. It had been taken to a hospital in the middle of that day, the fourth day of illness which began with only snuffles. This child, too, had been given something to stop the cough which it did promptly and effectively. Oxygen was used and some sort of heart stimulant. Transfusion had been advised but refused by the father.\nI found this tiny mite of humanity lying quite limp, eyes closed, lips parted, blue all over, skin rather cool, respiration gasping for five or six breaths then no respiration for 3/4 minute, then five or six more gasps and the same intervals ; pulse very thready during the attempts at respiration's and gone in the interval between ; ability to swallow gone.\nI did not wonder that the doctor in charge had felt hopeless. However, I watched closely for a time, could not find more symptoms except slight twitching of facial muscles and a chest just loaded with mucus.\nSo I put a dose of Zinc 1M, on the little tongue, with a few drops of water to moisten it and sat, watch in hand, counting the respiration's and intervals. In twenty minutes respiration's were nine or ten before the interval. In another twenty minutes they were twelve or fourteen, the interval a little shorter and pulse correspondingly more perceptible. This went on until she breathed once 33 times before stopping and color was decidedly better. She opened her eyes once but they closed again. Then she suddenly dropped back to the first state. A second dose of Zinc 1M produced slow improvement which did not reach half way to the highest point before the sudden drop. A third dose did very little. It was the wee small hours and my little patient was growing weaker.\nI had questioned the mother about symptoms which preceded the suppression of the cough and secured a fair picture of Kali-bi. This was given in the 1M, a single dose. Again reaction was slow but quite perceptible for half an hour, again the sudden dropping back. Repetition did not do much but the child was holding her own, not improving. At five A. M., I left, not knowing what else to do and believing vitality was too low for recovery. The same intervals in respiration over and over, the same cyanosis and utter limpness. Later in that forenoon received the message that the baby was much better. Hurrying back, I found that she began to move arms and legs and open eyes about 9.30 and that she had cried twice and coughed once. Color had become nearly normal and respiration had been continuous for about an hour and a half. When I arrived, however, she was blue again and had slipped back into the old condition though not so bad. The hospital people would not co-operate at all, so she was taken home ; almost died on arrival but revived with oxygen and Kali-bi.\nTo make a long story short, she began next day vomiting thick mucus, quantities of it and passed more in her greenish stools. The chest cleared nicely during the next three days and temperature dropped. She continued with spells of cyanosis and irregular respiration until I gave one dose of Lachesis 1M., no more after that.\nFever rose again once and was gone when both ears began to discharge.\nFour weeks after this desperate illness, she had gained a pound and a half.\nAnother crisis of those first days was the sudden vanishing of the mother's milk from anxiety and long nursing. A dose of Caust. set this right within a few hours.\nIn infancy a boy had a bad eczema on the scalp and some on the face. This was suppressed over and over during the first two years of life by a skin specialist who bound up the head with salves and ointments. Whenever the eruption appeared again after an interval, more treatment was given until there was no return.\nI saw this boy first at 5 years. He was then pale with waxy pallor, puffy under the eyes, easily tired, not equal to one half the play other boys his age could stand and very nervous. He was in his first year at public school and could not stand it ; was in school half a day, then must be put to bed at least two hours. Sometimes four. After playing for two hours would throw himself down to rest. He had naturally a quiet, sweet disposition but when tired was cross and very restless, complaining frequently of twitching in his legs and aching legs and head ; could not get to sleep on account of fidgety legs. He was hungry frequently but seemed ill nourished. He had high fever at times without apparent cause or any but these nervous symptoms. If he had a cold or any acute attack, he was long recovering.\nZinc had changed all this. Treatment was begun in August 1937. Now he has been in school since last fail with only one break when he had a very light attack of the epidemic grippe, in bed only two days and back to school in five. His color is good and weight normal. Nervous symptoms are gone. The eruption has not returned as yet. He has had two doses of Zinc 10M., two of 50M. and one of CM.\nThis is the boy's elder sister who was nine when I gave her Zinc 10M, for her disposition. She had been always irritable, contrary, mean, cruel, unkind, selfish, unsubdued by punishment, discordial, thinking of most unexpected mean things to do and say.\nBelonging to reasonable and rich parents, but inheriting deep miasmatic tendencies from both, she acted to me like a child emotionally imprisoned, suppressed in her real nature. She is a delicate-featured, beautiful child to look at, so these evidences of emotional unbalance were more striking. Her mother's case worked out to Zinc and I decided to try it on her. The result is truly wonderful transformation and her parents are most grateful.\nSource : Homœopathic Recorder, Dec. 1939.\n\nQuestion: what did drita find out?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Over time this—along with other factors that encouraged linguistic and cultural assimilation, such as political unity, frequent travel and commerce, military service, etc.—made Latin the predominant language throughout the western Mediterranean. Latin itself was subject to the same assimilatory tendencies, such that its varieties had probably become more uniform by the time the Western Empire fell in 476 than they had been before it. That is not to say that the language had been static for all those years, but rather that ongoing changes tended to spread to all regions. All of these homogenizing factors were \n\n Vulgar Latin (in Latin, sermo vulgaris) is a blanket term covering vernacular dialects of the Latin language spoken from earliest times in Italy until the latest dialects of the Western Roman Empire, diverging still further, evolved into the early Romance languages—whose writings began to appear about the 9th century. This spoken Latin differed from the literary language of Classical Latin in its grammar and vocabulary. It is likely to have evolved over time, with some features not appearing until the late Empire. Other features are likely to have been in place much earlier. Because there are few phonetic transcriptions of the daily speech of these Latin speakers (to match, \n\n  The Latins were an ancient Italic people of the Latium region in central Italy (Latium Vetus, \"Old Latium\"), in the 1st millennium BC. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from Latinus. Latinus was worshiped on Mons Albanus (Monte Albano) during an annual festival attended by all Latins, including those from Rome, one of the Latin states. The Latin cities extended common rights of residence and trade to one another. Rome's territorial ambitions united the rest of the Latins against it in 341 BC, but in the end Rome won in 338 BC. Consequently, some of the Latin states were incorporated within the Roman state, and their inhabitants were given full Roman citizenship. Others became Roman allies and enjoyed certain privileges.\n\n The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium. As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture, during the Roman Empire, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic Latin-speaking people and the Latin-speaking people of Italia, Gaul, Hispania and Dacia whose land was settled by Roman colonists. In the late 15th–16th centuries, a millennium after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, with a number of maritime discoveries, first Portugal, then Spain and then France began to build world empires, in the Americas, Sub-Saharas and the East Indies. In consequence to the Mexican-American War and the ultimate loss of California to the United States, by the mid-19th century, the former American colonies of these nations, as well as French-speaking areas of America became known as Latin America and this region's inhabitants as Latin Americans. \n\n  Latin is a member of the broad family of Italic languages. Its alphabet, the Latin alphabet, emerged from the Old Italic alphabets, which in turn were derived from the Etruscan and Phoenician scripts. Historical Latin came from the prehistoric language of the Latium region, specifically around the River Tiber, where Roman civilization first developed. How and when Latin came to be spoken by the Romans are questions that have long been debated. Various influences on Latin of Celtic dialects in northern Italy, the non-Indo-European Etruscan language in Central Italy, and the Greek in some Greek colonies of southern Italy have been detected, but when these influences entered the native Latin is not known for certain. Surviving Latin literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin in its broadest definition.

There is a change in political alliances just preceding the event when royal personages from the Mexican highland city of Teotihuacan consolidate power individually as Mayan kings. \n\n The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that \n\n sunset on August 13, which was the beginning date of the Maya Long Count calendar. However, recent research has shown that the earliest orientations marking sunsets on August 13 (and April 30) occur outside of the Maya area. Their purpose must have been to record the dates separated by a period of 260 days (from August 13 to April 30), equivalent to the length of the sacred Mesoamerican calendrical count. In general, the orientations in Mesoamerican architecture tend to mark the dates separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days, i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system. The distribution of these dates in the year suggests that the orientations allowed \n\n calendar (for example, 13.0.0.0.0).

For example, if it is 23 years after the beginning of the Dreamspell, month 1, day 2, the date is \"NS1.23.1.2\" This system, as mentioned above, is similar to the dating system of the \"Mayan calendar\" cycle which \"ends\" on December 21, 2012.

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture,  while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience,  easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.\n\nQuestion: when does the mayan calendar end exactly?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when the German Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.  In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, \n\n Hans Scherenberg (born Dresden 28 October 1910, died Stuttgart 17 November 2000) was a German automobile engineer and executive. After studying engineering at the Technical Universities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe, between 1930 and 1935, Scherenberg joined Daimler Benz AG as a research engineer. Here he worked on the development of the first petrol injected aircraft engine (The DB 601) which went into production in 1937. In 1942 he received his doctoral thesis from Stuttgart University for a work on \"Valve control systems for four-stroke flight engines.\" Following the Second World War the victorious war-time allies had enforced Daimler Benz AG a pause in engine fuel-injection development. Scherenberg moved to work with Adolf Schnürle's engineering consultancy, moving again in 1948 to join the Gutbrod company which had recently been taken on by Walter Gutbrod on the death of the founder Wilhelm \n\n Born in Süßen in the Swabian region of southern Germany, Geiger originally trained as a cartwright, before studying as a design engineer at University prior to joining Daimler-Benz in April 1933. He began in the special vehicles manufacturing department, where, in the 1930s, he was responsible for the 500K and 540K sports cars. Geiger left Daimler-Benz in April 1948, but returned to the company two years later, this time as a test engineer in the styling department. He became head of styling within a few years, after designing the 300SL gullwing coupé, named one of the ten greatest Mercedes ever built and one of the 25 greatest cars of the 20th century. Geiger continued to work at Daimler-Benz until his retirement in December 1973, by which time he had helped create the W111/W112 (1959) and W110 (1961) \"Fintails\", the W113 \"Pagoda\" (1963) and R107 (1971) SL coupé/convertibles, the W108/109 (1965) and W116 (1972) series of the S-Class, and the Mercedes-Benz 600 limousine (1963). Geiger was succeeded by Bruno Sacco, one of his staff at the styling department. Geiger died in Bad Überkingen in 1996, aged 88.\n\n Cäcilie Bertha Ringer was born on 3 May 1849 to a wealthy family in Pforzheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden. Two years before her marriage to Karl Benz, she used part of her dowry to invest in his failing iron construction company. As an unmarried woman, she was able to do so; after she married Benz, according to German law, Bertha lost her legal power to act as an investor. On 20 July 1872, Bertha Ringer married Carl Benz. As he moved on to a new manufacturing venture, Benz & Cie, he continued to use her dowry as financial support. Carl finished work on his first horseless carriage in December 1885. \n\n Benz died in her villa in Ladenburg in 1944, where the workshop of Carl Benz had been built after they had moved there in 1906 and he established a solely family-held business, Benz and Sons. Karl Benz had died in 1929, after the success of Daimler-Benz was assured. Members of the family resided in the home for 25 more years. The Benz home now has been designated as historic and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation, which aims to promote science and research in order to gain a better understanding of the correlation between man, the environment and technology. In 1925 Carl Benz wrote the following in his memoirs: \"Only one person remained with me in the small ship of life when it seemed destined to sink. That was my wife.

In 1948, Israel's first festival stamps were designed by Otte Wallish and depicted LMLK seals stamped onto jars from the time of King Hezekiah (circa 700 BCE). The Rosh Hashanah stamps often display secular and patriotic motifs, such as bread, wine, olives, soldiers, kibbutzniks, Israeli dancing and the national library (1992). Fittingly, many series feature religious motifs, such as curtains for synagogue arks (1999), Hebrew Bible stories (1994), ushpizin of Sukkot (1997), Jewish lifecycle events (1995), and the orders the Mishnah (2006), with Nezikin pictured here.\n\n The Book of Exodus establishes the new moon of Nisan, which is the first month of Aviv, as the beginning of the Hebrew calendar: \"And the spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying: \"This month shall mark for you the beginning of the months; it shall be the first of the months of the year for you.\"\" - Exodus 12:1-2 In the Book of Numbers, God speaks of the celebration of the new moon to Moses: \"And on your joyous occasions—your fixed festivals and new moon days—you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your sacrifices of well-being.\" - Numbers 10:10 In, \n\n Rosh Hashanah is celebrated by practicing Jews throughout the world on the first day of Tishrei, which falls between early September and early October.

The book starts with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and covers the entire Second World War ending with the final surrender of Axis forces.\n\n World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. Western leaders were stunned when the Soviet Union and Germany split control of Poland; the two powers had reached a non-aggression pact in August 1939, which contained a secret protocol for the partition of Poland. Though few Americans wanted to intervene in the war, an October 1939 Gallup poll showed that over 80 percent of the country favored Britain and France over Germany.

The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of total war, erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of \n\n This is a timeline of events of World War II in 1939, from the start of the war on 1 September 1939. For events preceding September 1, 1939, see the timeline of events preceding World War II. Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later marks the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, western Europe saw very little land or air active military confrontation at first, and the period was termed the \"Phoney War\". In eastern Europe, however, the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed on 23 August opened the way in September for the Soviet Union's invasion of eastern Poland, which was divided between the two invaders before the end of the month. The Soviet Union starts a new military offensive by invading Finland at the end of November. 1939: September·October·November·December·\n\n The following is a list of Soviet military equipment of World War II which includes firearms, artillery, vehicles, aircraft and warships. World War II was the deadliest war in history which started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Following political instability built-up in Europe from 1930, Germany, which aimed to dominate Europe, attacked Poland on 1 september 1939 marking the official start of World War II. The USSR (Soviet Union) invaded Poland from 17 September 1939, when the Polish state and its government actually ceased to exist. Germany with its allies attacked the USSR on 22 June 1941, and the country lost 26.6 million people during four years of the Great Patriotic war. The war in Europe ended on 7 May 1945 with the capitulation of Germany to the allied (including Soviet) forces. About 80-90% of losses during the entire war the German armed forces suffered on the Soviet (Eastern) front, whose contribution to the victory was decisive. By the end of the war, the Soviet Union produced 30.3 million rifles; 1,476 million machine guns; 516,648 artillery guns; 347,900 mortars; 119,769 tanks and self-propelled guns; 265,600 army trucks; 213,742 military aircraft; 2 cruisers; 25 destroyers; 52 submarines.\n\nQuestion: when do world war ii end?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since all humans sin, the only way into Heaven is faith in Jesus Christ, who is both God's Son and God in human form. Good deeds in this life store up treasures in heaven – entering into Heaven (the true life) is worth far more than earthly riches and honor. However, salvation is through grace-alone. All others go to Hell. Once in Hell, people will suffer to varying degrees depending on their deeds in life. This punishment is eternal. When the world ends all of the dead will come back to life for their permanent judgement and placed in a new Heaven, Earth and Hell. Protestantism differs from other World beliefs in that while it allows a distinct avenue for judgement by a Higher Power, passage into a comfortable eternal life cannot be earned, but happens due to the self-sacrifice of that Higher Power by Solo Fides.\n\nHeaven is a state of unending union with the divine nature of God, not ontologically, but by grace. It is an eternal life, in which the soul contemplates God in ceaseless beatitude. ; Purgatory is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints. ; Final Damnation: Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not \n\n about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that hell is a place of punishment brought about by a person's self-exclusion from communion with God. In some ancient Eastern Orthodox traditions, Hell and Heaven are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a person to God's love. Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as Marilyn McCord Adams) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as humans the awesome responsibility of their eternal destinies. Jonathan Kvanvig, in \n\n The \"Spiritual Combat\", a written work by Lorenzo Scupoli, states that four assaults are attempted by the \"evil one\" at the hour of death. The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. In the 1990s, the Catechism of the Catholic Church defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.\n\n The notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the Catholic Church. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory. Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, believed in an intermediate state between death and the resurrection of the dead and in the possibility of \"continuing to grow in holiness there\", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of helping by prayer any who may be in that state.\n\nQuestion: what do christians believe about heaven hell and purgatory?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained the confidence of the King's favourite, Patrick, Master of Gray, in 1584–1585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the Treaty of Berwick, a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot. Following the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Throckmorton Plot (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. \n\n and even to take her life. Rather than the expected aid, Elizabeth imprisoned Mary for nineteen years in the charge of a succession of jailers, principally the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1584 Elizabeth's Privy Council signed a \"Bond of Association\" designed by Cecil and Walsingham which stated that anyone within the line of succession to the throne on whose behalf anyone plotted against the Queen, would be excluded from the line and executed. This was agreed upon by hundreds of Englishmen, who likewise signed the Bond. Mary also agreed to sign the Bond.

The long-term goal of the plot was the invasion of England by the Spanish forces of King Philip II and the Catholic League in France, leading to the restoration of the old religion.

Charles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites \n\n described and with illuminated figures illustrated\") and included 162 pages of text (eight pages were unpaginated) and six colour plates. It was published in Swedish, with a Latin translation printed in a slightly smaller font below the Swedish text. Clerck described in detail 67 species of Swedish spiders, and for the first time in a zoological work consistently applied binomial nomenclature as proposed by Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus had originally invented this system for botanical names in his 1753 work Species Plantarum, and presented it again in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae for more than 4,000 animal species. Svenska Spindlar is the only pre-Linnaean source to be recognised as a taxonomic authority for such names.\n\n The 12th edition of Systema Naturae was the last edition of Systema Naturae to be overseen by its author, Carl Linnaeus. It was published by Laurentius Salvius in Holmiæ (Stockholm) in three volumes, with parts appearing from 1766 to 1768. It contains many species not covered in the previous edition, the 10th edition which was the starting point for zoological nomenclature.\n\nCarl Linnaeus's development of taxonomic systems and technical terminologies significantly contributed to the emergence of a new research object in botany: the 'natural' system. During the time of Linnaeus, there was an increasing amount of information on previously unknown plant and animal species, leading to a concept known as 'information overload.' In order to effectively organize and handle this wealth of information, Linnaeus created taxonomic systems, rules of nomenclature, and technical terminologies.\n\nBy creating a standardized system for classifying and naming plants, Linnaeus provided botanists with a common language and framework for studying and categorizing different species. His system, known as binomial nomenclature, assigned every species a unique two-part scientific name based on their genus and species. This system revolutionized the field of botany by establishing a clear and universal method for identifying and referring to plants.\n\nAdditionally, Linnaeus's taxonomic system allowed for the comparison and classification of plants based on their shared characteristics and relationships. By organizing plants into clusters and hierarchies, Linnaeus enabled researchers to identify patterns and similarities among different species, which opened up new avenues for studying their biological and ecological features.\n\nFurthermore, Linnaeus's development of technical terminologies provided researchers with specific vocabulary and descriptive terms to accurately communicate and document their observations. This standardization of terminology facilitated accurate and consistent communication among botanists, ensuring that their findings could be understood and built upon by others in the field.\n\nIn summary, Carl Linnaeus's taxonomic systems and technical terminologies played a crucial role in addressing the challenge of information overload in botany. His innovations provided a structured and organized approach to classifying and naming plants, allowing for a more systematic and comprehensive study of the natural world. Ultimately, Linnaeus's work laid the foundation for the emergence of the 'natural' system, which continues to be a fundamental aspect of botanical research today.\n\n Carl Linnaeus ( 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné, was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, taxonomist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linnæus (after 1761 Carolus a Linné). Linnaeus was born in Råshult, the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730.

San Francisco is at 122.41°W longitude and Richmond, Virginia is at 77.46°W longitude. They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°). The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example. San Francisco is in the Pacific Time zone, and Richmond is in the Eastern Time zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.

Series MVP Frank Robinson hits a home run off Don Drysdale for the only run of the game and gave Baltimore a sweep of the defending World Series Champion Dodgers. The shutout completes a World Series record 33 scoreless innings pitched by Orioles pitchers, beginning with Moe Drabowsky pitching 6 innings in relief of McNally in Game One, followed by shutouts by Jim Palmer and Wally Bunker—neither of whom had pitched a shutout during the regular season.

The Browns remained in Missouri until the end of the 1953 season, when Major League Baseball's owners elected to move the franchise to Baltimore, Maryland, where they were renamed the Orioles, after Maryland's state bird. Seven managers have taken the Orioles franchise to the post-season; Earl Weaver led the Orioles to a team-record six playoff appearances. Weaver, Hank Bauer, and Joe Altobelli are the only managers who have won a World Series championship with the club: Bauer in the 1966 World Series, over the Los Angeles Dodgers; Weaver in the 1970 World Series, over the Cincinnati Reds; and Altobelli in the 1983 World Series, over the \n\n five and losing four.

Reliever Tippy Martinez posted a career high with 21 saves, while Sammy Stewart added nine wins out of the bullpen as the O's pitching led the AL in shutouts (15) and was second in wins (98) and ERA (3.63). The Orioles won the American League East by six games over the Detroit Tigers.

He believed philosophy must be taught its true purpose, and for this purpose a new method must be devised. With this conception in his mind, Bacon \n\n wife Barbara met astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at a reception at 10 Downing Street. Bacon was a descendant of the family of the philosopher Sir Francis Bacon (who had no children), and he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After Cambridge he became an apprentice with the Newcastle engineering firm owned by Sir Charles Parsons, and was strongly influenced by him. The principle of the fuel cell had been demonstrated by Sir William Grove in 1839 and other investigators had experimented with various forms of fuel cell. However unlike previous workers in the field, Bacon was an engineer and he was comfortable working with machinery operating at high temperatures and pressures. He \n\n he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon Baron Verulam, of Verulam, in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam. Bacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as Viscount St Alban, on 27 January 1621.\n\n Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban, (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626), also known as Lord Verulam, was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution. Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves.

He famously died of pneumonia contracted while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He served both as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method and pioneer in the scientific revolution. Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments.\n\nQuestion: who is sir francis bacon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When Amy Phipps Guest offered to sponsor the first solo flight by a woman across the Atlantic Ocean, publisher George P. Putnam joined the search for a female aviator to undertake the journey. When Putnam asked Boston public relations specialist Harold Railey if he had any contacts in Boston who could suggest a candidate, Railey contacted his friend Belknap, who suggested \"a young social worker who flies,\" Amelia Earhart.

On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew, Paul Mantz, Harry Manning and Fred Noonan, flew the first leg of her attempt to circumnavigate the globe, from Oakland to Honolulu, Hawaii.

Earhart also taught at the high schools in Medford and Belmont, MA, and she remained an active member of the Medford community until her death.\n\n After Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, Muriel Earhart's life took on a new dimension. Earhart devoted significant time to coordinating Amelia's posthumous affairs, setting up donations, marshalling information, and dealing with Amelia's fans. She corresponded with museums, aviation clubs, the U.S. Air Force, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Earhart also spoke out against the speculations that arose in the wake of Amelia's death. She denied, for example, that her sister died while on a spy mission, as some theorists have past suggested. Earhart wrote two books about Amelia, Courage is the Price and Amelia, My Courageous Sister.

In 2011-2013 he moved to Hellas Verona, where he led the team in the student category, and then returned, in 2013, to Albino Leffe where as coach of Berretti he won the Category Championship, while in the first team he held the role of assistant coach alongside Elio Gustinetti and qualifying for the Pro League 11th Division Play Off. On 7 November, following the dismissal of Alessio Pala, he was promoted to the head of the first team of AlbinoLeffe in the Pro League and was sacked after three days due to poor results. On 29 June 2016, it was announced that he had been appointed as Pro Patria's coach for the 2016-2017 season in the Serie D season. On 14 April 2017, he resigned.\n\n was dismissed from his coaching post on 29 April 2018, after a 0–1 home loss to AlbinoLeffe, with the team in second place in the league table with only one game to go. He returned into management on 8 January 2019 as head coach of newly promoted Serie C club Rieti, successfully saving the team from relegation by achieving 24 points in his 17 games in charge. He left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season. On 16 October 2019, he was hired by Serie C club Avellino.

It began against Leicester City in the FA Community Shield, with United prevailing 2–1 to win the first trophy of the domestic calendar. In February 2017, the club won their second trophy of the campaign, beating Southampton 3–2 in the EFL Cup Final. Although they missed out on qualifying for the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League via the league, having finished in sixth place, a 2–0 victory over Ajax in the 2017 UEFA Europa League Final meant they qualified for the Champions League group stage as Europa League title holders. The triumph also made United the fifth team to have won UEFA club coall three main European club trophies. Following the departure of Louis van Gaal at the end of the previous season, the club signed former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho on a three-year contract, with the option of a further year.\n\n Former club captain and fan favourite Antonio Conte was officially appointed as the new manager on 31 May 2011, taking over the post previously left vacant following the sacking of Luigi Delneri. It was Conte's first appointment at a major Serie A club; he previously managed Siena, Arezzo, Atalanta, and Bari respectively, winning two Serie A promotions in the process (with Bari and Siena). His arrival coincided with the acquisitions of Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal, both top-class midfielders. The 2011–12 season also marked the opening of a new stadium, named Juventus Stadium. It was officially opened on 11 September, in a match against Parma that ended 4–1.

Recently, I ran into Zenga, who is now coach of National Bucharest, and said, ‘I hope you're a better coach than Bagnoli was at Inter.’ I said it to remind him of that time. Signing for Inter was my greatest football mistake. In 1992, I was the top striker in Europe. I could have gone anywhere I wanted - Real, Barcelona, Manchester United. My career would have been much richer, in football terms and financially, if I had. And I was only one of the players whose career Inter ruined: think of Wim Jonk, Matthias Sammer, Igor Shalimov.

During the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, the Low Franconian dialects now spoken in Germany, used Middle Dutch or Early Modern Dutch as their literary language and Dachsprache. Following a 19th-century change in Prussian language policy, use of Dutch as an official and public language was forbidden; resulting in Standard German taking its place as the region's official language. As a result, these dialects are now considered German dialects from a socio-linguistic point of view. Nevertheless, topologically these dialects are structurally and phonologically far more similar to Dutch, than to German and form both the smallest and most divergent dialect cluster within the contemporary German language area.\n\n While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried took some measures to encourage assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for either language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. In 1846, 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under one percent of the population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions. In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. By the end of the period, social change and internal immigration from Wallonia contributed to the growing importance of French in Brussels.\n\nCape Dutch, a direct transplantation of European Dutch to Southern Africa, and ; 'Hottentot Dutch', a pidgin that descended from 'Foreigner Talk' and ultimately from the Dutch pidgin spoken by slaves, via a hypothetical Dutch creole. The Afrikaans language arose in the Dutch Cape Colony, through a gradual divergence from European Dutch dialects, during the course of the 18th century. As early as the mid-18th century and as recently as the mid-20th century, Afrikaans was known in standard Dutch as a \"kitchen language\" (kombuistaal), lacking the prestige accorded, for example, even by the educational system in Africa, to languages spoken outside Africa. Other early epithets setting apart Kaaps Hollands (\"Cape Dutch\", i.e. Afrikaans) as putatively beneath official Dutch standards included geradbraakt, gebroken and onbeschaafd Hollands (\"mutilated/broken/uncivilised Dutch\"), as well as verkeerd Nederlands (\"incorrect Dutch\"). Den Besten theorises that modern Standard Afrikaans derives from two sources: Thus in his view Afrikaans is neither a creole nor a direct descendant of Dutch, but a fusion of two transmission pathways.\n\n Dutch (Nederlands ) is a West Germanic language spoken by about 25 million people as a first language and 5 million people as a second language, constituting most of the population of the Netherlands (where it is the only official language countrywide) and about 60% of the population of Belgium (as one of three official languages). It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after its close relatives English and German. Outside the Low Countries, it is the native language of the majority of the population of Suriname where it also holds an official status, as it does in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, which \n\n The official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands.

West Frisian is also a recognized language and it is used by the government in the province of Friesland.

Mariah received a $1500 scholarship from Sara’s Wish Foundation.\nPeru has become a popular destination for many travelers of all ages. Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. In addition, it is important to remember basic awareness and common sense to keep you safe while traveling to ensure your health and safety. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru.\nDiamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness: You may choose to take Diamox (acetazolamide) to help prevent acute high altitude sickness. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. This medication causes an increase in urination and respiratory rate. The side effects include numbness, tingling, or vibrating sensations in your hands, feet, and lips, also an alteration in taste and a ringing in your ears. Diamox should be continued until the second or third night at altitude. If you are concerned with acclimatizing, talk to your doctor before you leave.\nIbuprofen: An anti-inflammatory and pain reliever wonderful for the first few days when adjusting to altitude!\nA decongestant: High altitude and dry air make it very easy to get a respiratory infection (a cold) that is hard to kick. A decongestant combined with hot, steamy showers is a wonderful relief in case you happen to catch a cold while on the trip.\nCiprofloxacin: Common anti-biotic for traveler’s diarrhea… something unfortunately not too uncommon while bouncing around developing countries and adjusting to the local cuisine.\nSunscreen/repellant: Peruvian sun, especially at altitude, is intense and sunscreen can be expensive in some touristy destinations. Repellant is also great for Manchu Picchu, although other highland areas do not have many biting insects. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home.\nAnd any medications you normally take, including extra contacts/glasses.\nBring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. You may access the CDC website (www.CDC.gov) for further information about precautions for Peru and South America.\nMedical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. Although it is not something many of us like to dwell on before traveling, having insurance is a good safe guard against much hardship if an emergency does unfortunately occur.\nBring all insurance information with you, and leave another copy with someone you trust at home in case of an emergency!\nPassportAll travelers are required to have a valid passport (http: //travel.state.gov/passport). If you do not have a passport, get one quickly. Check the expiration date to make sure your passport is valid at least 6 months beyond your return date to the US and that there are blank pages available for entry/departure stamps. Be sure to have your passport with you during travel to and from Peru, although a Visa is not necessary. Extra copies of your passport should be made prior to leaving and stored either electronically, and/or in an area separate from where your actual passport will be stored while traveling.\nMoneyCredit cards and ATM cards are also good to have access to funds while traveling. Make sure you notify your bank of travels before you leave, and make a copy of all your cards to store with your passport copy while traveling. Also, include any international numbers for the appropriate banks with this documentation in case of theft or loss of a card. Bring an extra ATM card! I’ve had an ATM eat my card more than once while traveling, and in many small shops/towns, credit cards are a bit harder to use and will be harder to use as a primary means of currency.Also, it is a good idea to leave copies of such important documents with someone you trust at home in case of emergency.\nAlways good to have at least one person expecting to hear from you and have a rough idea where you are, no matter where you are in the world. Leave a rough itinerary with someone you trust at home, and keep in touch with them throughout your trip. In addition, bring a list of emergency contacts names, phone numbers (with international calling code), emails, etc. in case someone needs to help you reach home in an emergency abroad. Put this information in your day bag and an extra in your main pack at the start of the trip, that way it will be there if you need it.\nGetting to Cusco can be difficult, and most travelers will first arrive in Lima, Peru in route to Cusco. Due to flight schedules, it is likely you may spend a night, or at least several hours in this airport. Hanging out here isn’t always fun, but Internet is available at Starbucks as well as the bar in the hotel across the street from the airport can help pass the time. Some people chose to sleep waiting for their connection, but you are not allowed thru the security line until much closer to your flight time, so if you are solo, take care to be aware of your surroundings and keep your luggage close by. Anyone, traveling or not, has full access to this area of the airport.\nMany travel agents will be overly friendly offering tours and hotels upon arrival, sometimes rather aggressively. Although I cannot say much for the deals they offer, know that it is extremely easy, and probably more relaxing and cheaper, to find tourists offices all around Cusco and in most tourists towns throughout Peru. Collect your luggage and head into the parking lot to escape. There, taxis will be waiting. If you walk to the back of the lot, you will find bartering goes a bit further and you can get a decent price into town. If you do not know where you are staying for the first night, the Plaza del Arms is the center of Cusco’s touristy area and an easy place to find a coffee shop with tourist’s maps that will mark several hostels and restaurants to help get you oriented for your first night.\nHigh Altitude:If you choose to fly into Cusco from Lima, the first thing most travelers will notice is the effect of the high altitude. Cusco is situated at 11,151 feet above sea level. High altitude sickness is characterized by a headache with associated loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, fatigue or weakness, dizziness or light-headedness, and difficulty sleeping. The best treatment of acute high altitude sickness is rest, fluids, and mild analgesics such as acetominophen or ibuprofen. Symptoms will usually resolve in 1-2 days.In consideration of the effects of high altitude, please remember to take it easy, rest, and drink plenty of fluids. It will be difficult to exercise at this altitude until you acclimate. Normal physiologic changes in every one who goes to high altitude are hyperventilation, shortness of breath during exertion, changed breathing pattern at night, awakening frequently at night, and increased urination. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival).Medication Options: Diamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness, Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival). Coca tea or leaves: It is said that the drink helps reduce symptoms of high altitude illness. However, please remember coca leaves are also used to make cocaine. Ibuprofen –anti-inflammatory: Ibuprofen can be used to help reduce swelling of mucus membranes due to the altitude change. In plane terms, it can help you regain your appetite and reduce any sinus pressure you may feel upon arrival.\nFood borne Illness and PrecautionsThere are many bacterial and parasitic food borne illnesses in Peru. Please be very careful what and where you eat and drink. DO NOT DRINK WATER FROM THE FAUCET OR SHOWER. ONLY DRINK WATER FROM A SEALED BOTTLE OF PURIFIED/TREATED WATER. Do not eat ice cubes. Take precaution when brushing your teeth to not drink tap water. The Peruvian tap water is not purified. Keep your mouth closed when you take a shower. Only eat food that has been cooked or boiled. Do not eat food prepared on the street. Also avoid vegetable and fruit salads and cold vegetables as they may have been washed in the local water. Fruit that can be peeled is safe to eat. Be extremely careful when eating at buffet type restaurants. Do not eat raw seafood such as ceviche.Medications: Ciproflaxacin 500mg (#14) In case of acute gastroenteritis (fever, vomiting and diarrhea), you may want to bring a 7 day supply of Ciprofloxacin 500mg tablets #14, 1 tab orally twice daily) with you.\nAttire:Cusco is in the mountains and the average temperature during the daytime is 60° F and 40° F during the nighttime. You can check www.weather.com for an idea of Cusco temperatures before leaving. We suggest that you bring a warm jacket or sweater for the evening. A raincoat may be a good idea, particularly if you are there during the rainy season (November-March). If you will travel to Machu Picchu, consider bringing a short sleeve shirt and shorts or jeans. The temperature will be warmer than Cusco with considerable humidity. Because this region is known for warm alpaca clothes, you may want to purchase these items while in Peru.Hiking in Peru is amazing, but good quality hiking boots/clothes are a bit harder to come by if you are looking for normal US prices. If you enjoy hiking, make sure you bring sturdy shoes and a few very warm layers in your pack along with you.\nPickpockets:Although Cusco is a relatively safe part of Peru, common sense and awareness always helps keep you safe. Be particularly cautious for theft of money, cell phones, laptops, cameras and documents. Do not wear expensive jewelry or watches. Be especially cautious if visiting local markets or downtown Lima. A hidden money belt or pouch worn beneath your shirt may help prevent theft, and be sure to keep all zippers on bags securely closed, especially in crowded streets. Pickpockets: Walking around the tourist areas are rather safe during both day and night. However, always be aware of pickpockets, especially during festivals. Keep your bags/purses zipped up and if in crowds, in front of you so somebody cannot reach in and remove any of your valuables.San Blas: funky little artsy part of Cusco that is well worth a trip. However, this area can get rather quiet and is known to be a bit more notorious for muggings and pickpockets. Don’t walk around this area at night solo, and just be aware of your surroundings.\nElectricity:Because Peru uses 220 volts instead of 110 volts and a different electrical plug, an electrical adapter and voltage converter (transformer) will be required in Peru if you bring an electrical device from the US. Some electrical devices, such as your laptop, have this built in and will not need an electrical adapter.\nTransportation:Taxis are relatively inexpensive in Cusco. However, if traveling independently, always take secure taxis or call one if late at night. Settle on a price to your destination before leaving or entering the taxi, most are slightly negotiable. Locals generally are willing to tell you the appropriate price. If taking a taxi from a hostel, ask the front desk owner to point out a secure taxi if it is late at night, and if possible, travel with a friend. Carry bags with you instead of in the trunk if possible, a friend of mine had a taxi driver drive off before she was able to unload!If traveling to a more remote hostel/club/whatever at night, take a taxi in place of walking. Don’t be a target for muggings, and if you talk to those that have lived in the area for a while, a traveler walking around in a quiet part of town at night is a great way to make yourself a target!Buses/collectivos: Vans and buses frequently make loops around the city. Each one has a name on the top, and follows a set route. Overall, they are pretty safe and cheap. However, finding out the routes is sometimes a process of trial and error, or simply asking the locals. Many are happy to help.If taking a bus or van to a near-by town, such as Pisac, try to find one in good repair, as these roads are rather full of twists and turns. I often asked if I could sit in the front to avoid motion sickness and have the rare opportunity to buckle up for the journey. However, I warn you that this is not the seat for the faint of heart- sometimes seeing the narrow mountain road can be rather, well, thrilling, by itself. I recommend scheduling plenty of daylight on either end of the car journey to not only be safe on the road, but also allow you not to arrive in a strange new town or drop off location at night.\nAlcohol:Remember you are at altitude in a dry climate: this means not only will you become dehydrated quicker (think hangover), the alcohol will actually absorb faster into your bloodstream than at lower altitudes (think drunk faster). If your choose to drink, which many do due to the wide array of nightlife offered here, go slower than you normally would at home and try to find purified water to sip in between beverages.Girls: some bars/bartenders, like in any location, are known to slip drugs in girls drinks out at clubs. Try to always go out in groups, watch your drink being made, and never leave it unattended while you go off to dance or socialize.\nDrugs:Any street drugs such as cocaine and pot are offered fairly frequently on the streets of Cusco. Remember that these drugs are illegal and penalties for foreigners can be harsh. Use your head, and remember that staying in a foreign jail probably isn’t on the top of your to-do list.\nMoney:You may exchange money in Peru, but it is easiest in larger cities like Lima and Cusco. Bank ATM’s offer the best rates. Hotels can exchange money, but the rates are generally not as good. Credit cards can also be used in the major cities, but beware you may have to pay a fee or percentage for using the card abroad. If traveling to rural settings, be sure to have some cash in local currency (nuevos soles). Do not carry a large amount of cash. Avoid changing money on the street, as there is a chance of receiving false currency. Have CLEAN, NEW bills ($20s) for exchange only!!!! Ripped or crumbled bills will not be accepted for exchange.\nPhone:Your cell phone may operate in Peru; however check with your service plan to assess charges. Otherwise, calling cards or Skype (if you have internet) may used to call home. Local cell phones can be purchased quite cheaply in most markets in Peru, and you simply purchase minutes, as you need them. If staying in the country for a few weeks, this may be a great option not only for safety (sketch cab? Get lost? Dark sooner than expected? GREAT to have a phone at those moments), but also to keep in touch with friends along the way!\nLast of all, have fun! Staying safe while traveling mostly involves common sense, and building a few routines (extra document copies, making sure you have medical/evacuation insurance, keeping someone posted on your whereabouts, etc.) into your travel routine to keep you safe in case of the unexpected.\nThis entry was posted on April 3, 2013, in 2012, South America and tagged anna, cancer, peru, research.

They point out he is good at his job as \"Number One\", first officer to Captain Picard on the starship USS Enterprise 1701-D. In 2009, IGN rated William Riker the 22nd best character of all Star Trek up to that time. In 2018, CBR ranked Riker as the 12th best Starfleet character of Star Trek. In 2018, The Wrap placed William Riker as 5th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the Star Trek franchise. In 2017, IndieWire ranked Riker as the 2nd best character on Star Trek:The Next Generation.

Frakes also played Riker in an advertisement for Boole & Babbage.\n\n as her inspiration for wanting to become an astronaut and Whoopi Goldberg has also spoken of Nichols' influence. Goldberg asked for a role on Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the character Guinan was specially created, while Jemison appeared on an episode of the series. In her role as Lieutenant Uhura, Nichols kissed white actor William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk in the November 22, 1968, Star Trek episode \"Plato's Stepchildren\". The episode is cited as the first example of an interracial kiss on scripted U.S. television. The Shatner/Nichols kiss was seen as groundbreaking, even though it was portrayed as having been forced by alien \n\n adventures with them, and developing a nice friendship with Jean Luc Picard.  They even take a vacation trip together, in The Captain's Peril, shortly after the Dominion War's end, a few months prior to Star Trek: Nemesis.  Critics cite an overdone focus on Kirk as the glorified hero, often leaving Picard and others in downplayed roles.  These novels, which are not considered part of the overall continuity of the other Star Trek novels, are collectively referred to by fans as the \"Shatnerverse.\" Star Trek: New Voyages, also uses the idea of Kirk living on in that both released episodes feature possible \n\n Trek, and that's ours\". James Doohan, who played Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, said that Star Trek was about the characters and with a new cast the studio was \"trying to fool the public, and that's bad business.\" William Shatner, who portrayed James T. Kirk, was concerned with the overexposure of the franchise and how a new television series could affect future films. A memo sent on October 24, showed that Robert H. Justman, an associate producer on The Original Series, was working with Roddenberry on the new plans for a series, which was at that time untitled.

The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs. In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, breaking even Switzerland's record for peace. Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the Cold War, although Sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO.

Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century. In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years.

Today, the speaker of the Riksdag appoints (following a vote in the Riksdag) the prime minister and terminates his or her commission following a vote of no confidence or voluntary resignation. Cabinet members are appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. Laws and ordinances are promulgated by two Cabinet members in unison signing \"On Behalf of the Government\" and the government—not \n\n unicameral. Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between the King and the Riksdag until 1975. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag. Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" (Folkrörelser), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979 ).

He ran his own business in London from about 1593 to 1603; his shop was at the sign of the Angel in St. Paul's Churchyard. Wise published editions of the following five Shakespearean plays: In one view, \"Andrew Wise...struck gold three times in a row in 1597&ndash;8 by picking what would become the three best-selling Shakespearean quartos as the first three plays of \n\n The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet, is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play, with 29,551 words. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". It was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has inspired many other writers—from Johann \n\n Shakespeare's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. He developed theatre to an amazing extent and changed the way theatre is today. Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature (with Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world's greatest plays),  and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language. Specifically, in plays like Hamlet, Shakespeare \"integrated characterization with plot,\" such that if the main character was different in any way, the plot would be totally changed. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre (previous to Shakespeare, romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy). Through his soliloquies, Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to \"introduce [characters], convey information, provide an exposition or reveal plans\").\n\n His plays exhibited \"spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with a mingling of comedy with tragedy\". In King Lear, Shakespeare had deliberately brought together two plots of different origins. Shakespeare's work is also lauded for its insight into emotion. His themes regarding the human condition make him more acclaimed than any of his contemporaries. Humanism and contact with popular thinking gave vitality to his language. Shakespeare's plays borrowed ideas from popular sources, folk traditions, street pamphlets, and sermons. Shakespeare also used groundlings widely in his plays. The use of groundlings \"saved the drama from academic stiffness and preserved its essential \n\n  Shakespeare's influence extends from theater and literatures to present-day movies, Western philosophy, and the English language itself. William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare's writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world’s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death.

The Constitution of the Russian Federation has provided all citizens the right to free healthcare since 1993. In 2008, 621,000 doctors and 1.3 million nurses were employed in Russian healthcare. The number of doctors per 10,000 people was 43.8, but only 12.1 in rural areas. The number of general practitioners as a share of the total number of doctors was 1.26 percent. There are about 9.3 beds per thousand population—nearly double the OECD average. Expenditure on healthcare was 6.5% of Gross Domestic Product, US$957 per person in 2013. About 48% comes from government sources which \n\n In an effort to stem Russia's demographic crisis, the government is implementing a number of programs designed to increase the birth rate and attract more immigrants to alleviate the problem. The government has doubled monthly child support payments and offered a one-time payment of 250,000 Rubles (around US$4,000) to women who had a second child since 2007. In 2006, the Minister of Health Mikhail Zurabov and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Health Protection Nikolai Gerasimenko proposed reinstating the Soviet-era tax on childlessness, which ended in 1992. So far, it has not been reinstated. In 2007, Russia saw the highest birth rate since the collapse of the USSR. The First Deputy PM also said about 20 billion rubles (about US$1 billion) will be invested in new prenatal centres in Russia in 2008–2009. Immigration is increasingly seen as necessary to sustain the country's population. By 2010, number of Russians dropped by 4.31% (4.87 million) from the year of 2000, during the period whole Russia's population died out just by 1.59% (from 145.17 to 142.86 million).\n\n Russia is a multinational state home to over 193 ethnic groups. In the 2010 Census, roughly 81% of the population were ethnic Russians, while rest of the 19% of the population were minorities; while around 84.93% of the Russia's population was of European descent, of which the vast majority were Slavs, with minorities of Germanic, Baltic-Finns and other peoples. There are 22 republics in Russia, designated to have their own ethnicities, cultures, and languages. In 13 of them, ethnic Russians consist a minority. According to the United Nations, Russia's immigrant population is the third-largest in the world, numbering over 11.6 million; most of which are from post-Soviet states, mainly Ukrainians. The Tatars, Bashkirs, and the Chechens are three predominantly Muslim minorities in \n\n Both the USSR and Russia (under Vladimir Putin), have cancelled exports of energy supplies to buyers who have gone against national objectives. In recent years, Putin has put forward diction on the dependability of Russian natural gas. Nevertheless, Russia's power in the international arena correlates to the demand for the resources that it delivers. Much of the Russian economy went through uncertainty following the end of the Soviet Union. This was not true for the Natural Gas Industry. The Ministry of the Gas Industry was converted into the company Gazprom in 1989 and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former Minister, became CEO. This political decision was not accepted easily. The Natural Gas Ministry officials fought hard to get this movement approved whereas the Petroleum Ministry failed to stay intact post-1989. Russia has the largest production of natural gas in the world. Oil production by Russia has increased drastically, especially over the early-2000s. This has led to a continued dependency on Russia for energy resources, by previous satellite countries. About 80% of the natural gas that Russia exports to Western Europe goes through Ukraine territory. This has incentivized Russia to continue Influencing the political agenda of Ukraine and other former USSR countries.\n\n Krasinyev, head of migration studies at the state-run Institute of Social and Economic Population Studies in Moscow, said Russia should only accept immigrants from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a view echoed by Alexander Belyakov, the head of the Duma's Resources Committee. Migration in Russia grew by 50.2% in 2007, and an additional 2.7% in 2008, helping stem the population decline. Migrants to Russia primarily come from CIS states and are Russians or Russian speakers. Thousands of migrant workers from Ukraine, Moldova, and the rest of the CIS have also entered Russia illegally, working but avoiding taxes. There are an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia.\n\nQuestion: where does russia import from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Switzerland joined the Latin Monetary Union in 1865. The 5-franc coin of 90% silver was unlimited legal tender together with gold, while 2-, 1,- and 1/2-franc coins of 83.5% silver were made subsidiary or limited legal tender. The billon coins (5% to 15% silver) were also subsidiary; they were replaced by Cupronickel and Nickel in 1879. In 1918/19, there was experimentation with brass (Cu-Zn) versions of the 5 and 10 centimes coins, but these were again retired in 1924. In 1968, the 83.5% silver coins \n\n of silver during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. During the Swiss Mediation period (1803&ndash;1814), Swiss currency reverted to a variety of cantonal francs. In the Restored Confederacy, from 1825, the western cantons (Bern, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Aargau, Vaud) formed a \"monetary concordate\" (Münzkonkordat) for the unification of their currencies, producing a standardised Konkordatsbatzen. The modern Swiss franc was introduced in 1850, two years after the formation of Switzerland as a federal state. The federal law establishing the new currency was passed on 7 May 1850. For practical reasons, the Swiss franc was initially created as having parity with the French franc of the day \n\n The Swiss franc (ISO code: CHF or 756), which appreciated significantly against the new European currency from April to September 2000, remains one of the world's strongest currencies, worth today around five-sixths of a euro. The Swiss franc is used in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein retains the ability to mint its own currency, the Liechtenstein franc, which it does from time to time for commemorative or emergency purposes. The name of the country \"Swiss Confederation\" is found on some of the coins in Latin (Confoederatio Helvetica), as Switzerland has four official languages, all of which are used on the notes. The denomination is abbreviated \"Fr.\" on the coins which is the abbreviation in all four languages.\n\n  The coins of the Swiss franc are the official coins used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The name of the subunit is centime in French and internationally, Rappen in German, centesimo in Italian, and rap in Romansh. There are coins in denominations of 5 centimes, 10 centimes, 20 centimes, ½ franc (50 centimes), 1 franc, 2 francs and 5 francs. All coins have the legend of either HELVETIA or CONFŒDERATIO HELVETICA, the Latin name of the Swiss Confederation, along with the year number. The 5, 10 and 20 centimes coins show a head of Liberty in profile, designed by Karl Schwenzer (1879). The ½, 1 and 2 francs coins show a standing figure of the national personification Helvetia, designed  by Albert \n\n The name \"Swiss franc\" (Schweizer Franken, French Franc suisse) was given to a silver coin minted in Bern from 1757, and later also in Basel, Solothurn and Lucerne. The value of this coin was 10 Batzen. The name franc was taken from the colloquial name of the French livre tournois, since 1726 defined as 4.5 grams of fine silver. In the Helvetic Republic, in 1799, there were plans to introduce a decimal currency system based on the Bernese currency, with a Swiss franc corresponding to 6.6149 grams of fine silver, equivalent to 10 Batzen or 100 Rappen.

The Peña del Aire is an enormous basalt rock that juts off the side of a canyon just north of the Santa María Regla Hacienda. Located 800 meters above the canyon floor, upon first glance, it appears suspended in the air, giving it its name. In this canyon flows a river arriving from Tulancingo and leading to the San Sebastian Canyon. Near this landmark are areas dedicated to rappelling, mountain climbing and hiking.

Gulf Hagas is one of 14 National Natural Landmarks in the State of Maine, and is open to the public for a fee during the regular season.\n\n competes with other attractions of the same prestige for visitors, which are all equally impressive; Flagstaff itself also competes with its nearby towns for access to the Grand Canyon, several of which have growing themes based on it (like Tusayan and the Grand Canyon Village). Lowell Observatory celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2019 and continues to be a leading astronomical research center, as well as a popular destination for visitors. More than 100,000 people visited in both 2018 and 2019; in 2019 the observatory opened its new Giovale Open Deck Observatory, an observation plaza with a suite of six advanced telescopes. \n\n A trailhead which gives hiking access into the canyon is located directly adjacent to Utah State Route 128 (SR‑128). The trailhead is located about 3 mi east of the junction of SR‑128 and U.S. Route 191. The Morning Glory Arch is located in the canyon about 2.5 mi from the trailhead and has a length of 943 ft. The canyon was named after William Grandstaff, a mixed-race cowboy, who prospected and ran cattle in the desert canyon in the late 1870s with a Canadian trapper named Frenchie. They took joint possession of the abandoned Elk Mountain Mission fort near Moab after 1877, and each controlled part of the Spanish Valley. Grandstaff fled the area in 1881 after being charged with bootlegging whiskey to the Indians.

The sacrificed animals, called aḍḥiya (Arabic: أضحية), known also by the Perso-Arabic term qurbāni, have to meet certain age and quality standards or else the animal is considered an unacceptable sacrifice. This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. In Pakistan alone nearly 10 million animals are slaughtered on Eid days costing over US$3 billion. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. Nonetheless traditional sacrifice rituals are still seen in rural areas where the state monitors less closely.\n\n transgressions' and 'bear the sin of many'.\" The Old Testament Apocrypha adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2–5). These traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness, and korbanot (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin. In addition, korbanot have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a \"payment for sin,\" but \n\n Animal sacrifice is the ritual killing of an animal as practiced by many religions as a means of appeasing a god or spiritual being, changing the course of nature or divining the future. Animal sacrifice has occurred in almost all cultures, from the Hebrews to the Greeks and Romans to the Yoruba. Over time human and animal sacrifices have become less common in the world, such that modern sacrifices in the West are rare. The practice of animal sacrifice is still common in Islamic society however, particularly during the festival Eid al-Adha.

Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended. Rabbinic Judaism was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. Orthodox Judaism regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism (Conservative, Reform, \n\n only place allowed by halakha for sacrifices. Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the Jewish–Roman wars of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter. When sacrifices were offered in ancient times, they were offered as a fulfillment of Biblical commandments. Since there is no longer a Temple, modern religious Jews instead pray or give tzedakah instead to atone for their sins as the korban would have accomplished. According to Orthodox Judaism, the coming of the messiah will not remove the requirement to keep the 613 commandments, and when the Temple is rebuilt, sacrifices will be offered again.\n\nQuestion: when did the jews stop making animal sacrifices?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By the 1820s, the native-born colonists' speech was recognisably distinct from speakers in Britain and Ireland. Australian English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. Australian English is relatively consistent across the continent, however it encompasses numerous regional and sociocultural varieties. 'General Australian' describes the de-facto standard dialect, which is perceived to be free of pronounced regional or sociocultural markers and that is often used in the media.\n\n Relative to many other national dialect groupings, Australian English is relatively homogenous across the country. Some relatively minor regional differences in pronunciation exist. A limited range of word choices is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals may be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions. In addition, some Australians speak creole languages derived from Australian English, such as Australian Kriol, Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk. Academic research has also identified notable sociocultural variation within Australian English, which is mostly evident in phonology.\n\nAustralia – English is the de facto official language of Australia. Auslan is recognised by the Australian Government and is spoken by many Australian deaf people. Australian Aboriginal languages, of which there are approximately 290–363, have recognition – though only a few are popularly spoken by Australian Indigenous people, including: Wiradjuri, Pitjantjatjara, Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Ngaanyatjarra, Warlpiri and Australian Kriol. Many government departments and agencies, as well as private services, have adopted the use of Mandarin Chinese as a de facto second language, reflecting Australia's large Chinese population and strong trade and diplomatic ties to China. ; Fiji — Fijian, English and Hindi (Fiji dialect) \n\n Australian English (AusE, AusEng, AuE, AuEng, en-AU) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Australia. Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n Although Australia has no official language, English has always been entrenched as the de facto national language. Standard Australian English serves as the standard dialect. According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for 72.6% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (2.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.2%), Vietnamese (1.2%), Italian (1.2%), Greek (1.0%), Tagalog (0.8%), Hindi (0.7%), Spanish (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.6%); a considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. A 2010–2011 study by the Australia Early Development Index found the most common language spoken by children after English was Arabic, followed by Vietnamese, Greek, Chinese, and Hindi. 0.3% of Australians spoke an Indigenous Australian language at home in 2016.\n\nQuestion: what do people in australia speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film was released on May 19, 2006, and stars Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, and Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. During its opening weekend, moviegoers spent an estimated $77 million in America, and $224 million worldwide. The movie received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert in its review wrote that \"Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones... it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.\" The film received two sequels: Angels & Demons, released in 2009, and Inferno, released in 2016. Ron Howard returned to direct both sequels.\n\n the Glory with Spencer Tracy was overlooked for decades, but in recent years it has received significant reappraisal due to recognition that the film was a major influence on the structure of Citizen Kane. Howard began directing 1940's Knute Rockne, All American, but after a disagreement with the studio was replaced by Lloyd Bacon. The film includes the scene in which future President of the United States Ronald Reagan, portraying terminally ill football player George Gipp, asks Rockne to have the team \"win just one for the Gipper\". Howard married his wife, Margaret Howard, in Las Vegas in 1949. After suffering from a throat malignancy, which started in 1953, he died in Los Angeles on February 21, 1954 at the age of 54.

Jefferson and Hamilton builds on the documentary evidence and analysis of Charles A. Beard's Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy. He discusses the operations of Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's first administration. Hamilton worked on behalf of financial speculators, including at least two dozen members of Congress, to fund depreciated debts at their full face value (to their substantial benefit and the substantial loss of the original holders of the debts), and to establish a national bank on the same basis. After their humiliating defeat in the 1924 elections Democrats \"began \n\n  George Washington – a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and president of the Constitutional Convention – became the first President of the United States under the new Constitution in 1789. The national capital moved from New York to Philadelphia in 1790 and finally settled in Washington DC in 1800. The major accomplishments of the Washington Administration were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans. His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, assumed the debts of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure. To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party – the first in the world based on voters – the Federalist Party.\n\n The essay is highly critical of the government in place at the time; however, it does not take the form of a diatribe. , yet manifestly biased, Federalist No. 1 heaps praise upon the Constitution as an efficient system of government. Hamilton is quite aware of his own bias: \"You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them, that [these ideas] proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\" Hamilton is keenly aware not only of his own bias, but also those of others. In fact, Federalist No. 1, as an introductory essay, \n\n The essay's major thrust is to impress upon citizens that the system that was in place prior to the Constitution was not worth keeping. Many would view this as a tall order; it can be hard to convince someone to replace something unless it is entirely broken. Hamilton never underestimated the gravity of the decision people were faced with. He met it head on in his introductory prose: \"It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are \n\n As a consequence of encouraging people to reject the old system, Hamilton supported the new Constitution at all costs. He went so far as to say the only viable alternatives were either a ratification of the Constitution or a complete dissolution of the existing Union. This conclusion was justified by referring to the Anti-Federalists, who claimed that the 13 members of the Union had already made for an unwieldy system and that governance depended on breaking the federal government into smaller, regional chunks. Hamilton thought this view so pernicious and outlandish that he encouraged its propagation so that all citizens could see how bizarre the Anti-Federalists' views were (bizarre according to Hamilton, that is).\n\nQuestion: what role did alexander hamilton play in the constitution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

East Thrace has an area of 23,764 km2 (3 percent of Turkey's land area), slightly smaller than Sardinia, and a population of about 16-17 million people or about 20 percent of the total Turkish population (in 2021); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor. However, densities are skewed by the metropolis of Istanbul. The two continents are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361 km. The southernmost part of Eastern Thrace is called the Gallipoli peninsula. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212 km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269 km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east.  \n\n  The Turkish Straits (Türk Boğazları) are two internationally significant waterways in northwestern Turkey. The straits create a series of international passages that connect the Aegean and Mediterranean seas to the Black Sea. They consist of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The straits are on opposite ends of the Sea of Marmara. The straits and the Sea of Marmara are part of the sovereign sea territory of Turkey and subject to the regime of internal waters. Located in the western part of the landmass of Eurasia, the Straits are conventionally considered the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia, as well as the dividing line between European Turkey and Asian Turkey. Owing to their strategic importance in international commerce, politics, and warfare, the Straits have played a significant role in European and world history. Since 1936, they have been governed in accordance with the Montreux Convention.\n\n Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persian descent. This cultural influence mainly stems from the Iranian culture, which spread through multiple ways but mainly during the early modern period where Iranian and Ottoman contact flourished and the influence of the Kurds, an Iranian ethnic group, on Turkish culture. However, it also entails influence from Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim influence. In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent Ottoman Empire. However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe.\n\nQuestion: what two continents is turkey on?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Giuseppe Garibaldi, the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. Pope Pius IX, a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the Vatican walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with Rome as capital. World War I has been \n\n The two historical parliamentary factions, the liberal and progressive Left and the conservative and monarchist Right, formed a single liberal and centrist group, known as Liberal Union, under the leadership of Giovanni Giolitti. This phenomenon, known in Italian as Trasformismo (roughly translatable in English as \"transformism\"—in a satirical newspaper, the PM was depicted as a chameleon), effectively removed political differences in Parliament, which was dominated by an undistinguished liberal bloc with a landslide majority until after World War I. Two parliamentary factions alternated in government, one led by Sidney Sonnino and the other, by far the larger of the two, by Giolitti. At that time the Liberals governed in alliance with the Radicals, the Democrats and, eventually, the Reform Socialists. This alliance governed against two smaller opposition: The Clericals, composed by some Vatican-oriented politicians, The Extreme, formed by the socialist faction which represented a real left in a present-day concept.\n\n Italy became a nation-state belatedly on 17 March 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the House of Savoy, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero. In 1866, Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. In exchange Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled Venice. King Emmanuel agreed to the alliance and the Third Italian War of Independence began. The victory against Austria allowed Italy to annex Venice. The \n\n Unification was achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont's interests. Martin Clark says, \"It was Piedmontization all around.\" Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title. National and regional officials were all appointed by Piedmont. A few regional leaders succeeded to high positions in the new national government, but the \n\n The unification of Italy involved a mixture of unions. The kingdom consolidated around the Kingdom of Sardinia, with which several states voluntarily united to form the Kingdom of Italy. Others polities, such as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Papal States, were conquered and annexed. Formally, the union in each territory was sanctioned by a popular referendum where people were formally asked if they agreed to have as their new ruler Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia and his legitimate heirs.

Many based their speculations about the script in the writings of Horapollon who considered the symbols to be ideographic, not representing any specific spoken language. Athanasius Kircher for example had stated that the hieroglyphs were symbols that \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures\", meaning that the script was in essence impossible to ever decipher. Others considered that the use of the hieroglyphs in Egyptian society was limited to the religious sphere and that they represented esoteric concepts within a universe of religious meaning that was now lost. But Kircher had been the first to suggest that modern Coptic was a degenerate form \n\n Egyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt, used for writing the Egyptian language. Hieroglyphs combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters. Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems (the Greek and Aramaic scripts), the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script and possibly Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic). The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III), with the first decipherable sentence \n\n in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty (28th century BC). Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom period; during this period, the system made use of about 900 distinct signs. The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom and Late Period, and on into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods. Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Roman period, extending into the 4th century AD. With the final closing of pagan temples in the 5th century, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost. Although attempts were made, the script remained undeciphered throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was finally accomplished in the 1820s by Jean-François Champollion, with the help of the Rosetta Stone.\n\n of the New Kingdom. Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD. Hieratic was used alongside hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom and throughout the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs and the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.\n\n The Egyptian language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.\n\nQuestion: what was the ancient egyptians spoken language?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Akhenaten built the city along the east bank of the Nile River, setting up workshops, palaces, suburbs and temples.

The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak.

Around 1350BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms.

As Karnak became more prominent, pharaohs sought to leave their mark on the temple complex with their own monuments. As successive rulers built their monuments, they dismantled the old ones and utilized the materials in their own designs. Preventive archaeological excavations before the renovation of Amenhotep II's calcite shrine were observed in this area by the Centre Franco-Égyptien d'Étude des Temples de Karnak (CFEETK), including an urban unit with mudbricks walls of Saito-Persian time.

Every Cuban household has a ration book (known as libreta) entitling it to a monthly supply of food and other staples, which are provided at nominal cost. In 2016, the Miami Herald wrote, \"... about 27 percent of Cubans earn under $50 per month; 34 percent earn the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month; and 20 percent earn $101 to $200.

State enterprises under the socialist planned economy, though, were entitled to exchange CUPs into CUCs and U.S. dollars at the official, subsidized rate of US$1 = CUC 1 = CUP 1. From 1 January 2021 Cuba implemented the so-called \"Day Zero\" of monetary unification which abolished the Cuban convertible peso as well as the 1 CUP/USD rate for state enterprises. Henceforth the Cuban Peso became the only legal tender in Cuba, CUCs were converted at the rate of 24 CUP/CUC, and a single official exchange rate of 24 CUP/USD became applicable for both public and private transactions.\n\n because the amounts of U.S. dollars being exchanged were more than anticipated. The measure helped the Cuban government collect hard currency. From 2014, state-owned shops began to set the prices in both CUC and CUP, and accept payment in either. The 10% surcharge was removed in July 2020. Cuba's economic difficulties since the end of 2019 have resulted in shortages of goods in CUP and CUC stores, the opening of stores priced in US dollars and only accepting payment by cards backed by foreign currencies, the waiving of the 10% penalty for exchanging US dollars, the resumption of US dollars as unofficial medium of exchange, and the plunge in the value of the CUC below US$1 in unofficial street exchanges.\n\n Cuban passports are issued to citizens of Cuba to facilitate international travel.

The bride's family supplements the Naqd amount with an equal or greater amount of cash, and gives dowry (called shura, shawar or amerwas). This dowry typically includes furniture, clothing, appliances, beds, household items, divans, jewelry, and other property. The dowry amounts are negotiated before the wedding. Higher dowry and lower Mahr are expected for widows and divorcées than for virgins. If elders of the two families do not agree on the dowry amount, the marriage is typically delayed or cancelled. The value and composition of the dowry varies according to social class, family wealth and regional customs. The kali al-sadaq (sometimes called mwahhar in Northern Morocco) is paid later, to technically meet the requirements of Mahr under Islamic Sharia. The shura (dowry) far exceeds the kali al-sadaq, and there is a large transfer of wealth from bride's family to the couple and the groom's family.\n\n Dowry is a traditional and current practice in Morocco, and is called shura, shawar, ssdaq or amerwas depending on the speaker's region and ethnicity (e.g. Arabic, Berber, etc.). Dowry in Morocco is separate from the Mahr or Sadaq that is religiously required by Sharia. Centuries ago, Mahr and Sadaq meant something different in Morocco. Mahr was the purchase price paid for the bride by the groom's family to the bride's father or guardian, while Sadaq was the betrothal gift offered by groom to the bride. Over time, the difference vanished and they are now one and the same, but different from the practice of dowry. In modern times, the Moroccan practice is to split the so-called Sadaq, which meets the Islamic requirement of Mahr, into two parts: naqd (cash) and kali (remainder Mahr).

After studying to become a teacher, she moved with her family once again to New York where she became a teacher at her mother's school at the age of 19.\n\n She was born in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1899, the youngest of four children. Howard Thurman, who lived nearby, was a childhood playmate. She attended the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute and graduated from Talladega College in 1922. That same year, as a teacher at the Daytona School, she witnessed a confrontation between the school's founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, and the Ku Klux Klan. Soon afterwards she married attorney Joseph S. Mitchell and moved to the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. While raising her two children, Joseph and Laura, she took courses at the Nursery Training School with nursery school movement pioneer Abigail Adams Eliot. She earned a master's degree in early childhood education from Boston University in 1935. Her husband was assistant attorney general of Massachusetts from 1945 to 1949; he was also a playwright. Her son, Joseph S. Mitchell, Jr., became the second African American to serve as a superior court judge in Massachusetts when he was appointed by governor John Volpe in 1966.\n\n Mayme Agnew was born in Van Buren, Arkansas on August 4, 1923. Her father, Jerry Agnew, Sr., owned and operated a general store, the only black-owned business in Van Buren. Clayton’s mother, Mary Knight Agnew, was a homemaker and renowned Southern cook, whose dinner gatherings drew friends from far and near. She had two siblings, Jerry, Jr. and Sarah Elizabeth (a well-known Southern California educator). Jerry and Mary consciously chose to expose their children to African Americans of accomplishment. During a 1936 visit to Arkansas by Mary McLeod Bethune, Clayton’s parents drove a significant distance to be sure that their children could hear her speak. Dr. Bethune remained a lifelong inspiration for Dr. Clayton,\" according to the MCLM website. She first attended Lincoln University of Missouri before transferring to University of California, Berkeley, where she received a B.A. She moved to New York \n\nPaul Benware – faculty; pastor, author and former professor of Bible and theology ; Mary McLeod Bethune – alumnus; the daughter of former South Carolina slaves, McLeod Bethune also graduated from Scotia Seminary for Girls before starting a school for girls in Florida which has become Bethune-Cookman University; She became an advisor to U.S. presidents Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D.

After Korea lost sovereignty to Japan in 1910, the Bank of Korea was renamed the Bank of Chosen (朝鮮銀行, Korean: Joseon Eunhaeng, Japanese: Chōsen Ginkō). The first Bank of Chosen note was dated 1911 and issued in 1914. 1 yen, 5 yen, 10 yen, and 100 yen were issued regularly, while there were occasionally some sen notes (5, 10, 20, 50 sen). 1000 yen was printed but never issued at the end of World War II. The earlier issues were redeemable \"in Gold or Nippon Ginko Note\". A similar phrase was written in Japanese on later issues.\n\n Cash is a name for several historical currencies used in Asia. It is applied to units used in China, Vietnam, and of Madras and Princely state of Travancore in British India. It is also occasionally used to refer to the Korean mun and the Japanese mon.

In 1849, her parents inherited an estate in County Kerry and as a result the family changed their names to Bernard. They were then living in Cork but she and her parents moved to Shehersee House on the Bernard's new estate. In 1854, she undertook formal education at Laurel Hill convent in Limerick. She was there for three years and after a year with her parents she went to Paris to complete her education at the Convent of Dames Anglaises where she chose a religious life. She became a novice at the Religious Sisters of Charity convent in Dublin when she was 21. In 1863, she took the name Sister Mary Joseph Arsenius and professed in 1866. She was initially involved in teaching but then moved on to managerial and administration. In 1877, a new convent opened in Ballaghaderreen in County Mayo and Bernard was chosen as Reverend Mother. The convent expanded in 1879 to create a national school and in 1866 an industrial school.\n\n Devos was born in 1935 in Kortenaken, a village in the Province of Flemish Brabant. She attended the Heilig Hartinstituut (School of the Holy Heart of Mary) in Heverlee, run by the Apostolic Sisters of the Annunciation, an active offshoot of the Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, an enclosed religious order. As a teenager, she became introduced to the writings of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, from which she felt called to serve God in India. To follow this dream, in 1960 Devos entered the religious congregation of the Missionary Canonesses of St. Augustine—now the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary—which had been founded in India by 1897, and whose General Motherhouse was located in Heverlee at that time. After completing the novitiate of the congregation, in order to prepare for service in the missions she was sent to be trained as a speech therapist. In 1965 she was sent to the missions of the congregation in Bombay, India. In 1966 Sr. Jeanne founded a student’s movement (YCS/YSM) with the aim of linking students to the underprivileged. http://www.ycsysmindia.com/\n\n died around that time. Her mother died from cholera on 30 May 1856 and her father followed mere months later in 1857 due to Yellow Fever in Saint Joseph's Hospital. In October 1857 she joined the Royal Asylum of Ajuda (Asilo Real da Ajuda) — in the palace of King Peter V — an orphanage for children of noble families that the Vincentian Sisters managed (until 1882) and remained there in the boarding school until 9 June 1862 when the Marquises of Valada invited her to reside with them. The Marchioness — a friend of her late parents — treated her like her own daughter. She remained \n\n August 1572. For the next decade she filled the post of an infirmarian. Once Teresa broke her left arm at Christmas in 1577 she became her almost inseparable companion and caregiver as well as an aid; it was she in whose arms Teresa died at Alba de Tormes on 4 October 1582. The nun made a short visit to Madrid after her friend's death. Following the death of the foundress, she returned to Ávila and took part in the foundation of a convent at Ocana (1595) while she was one of the seven nuns selected for the introduction of the order into the Kingdom of France \n\nIn what is now celebrated among the Missionaries of Charity as \"Inspiration Day\", 36-year-old Sister Agnes Teresa Bojaxhiu of the Loreto Sisters' Convent experienced what she would describe as the \"call within a call\".

Like Sesame Street, Pryor's Place featured a cast of puppets...hanging out and having fun in a friendly inner-city environment, along with several children and characters portrayed by Pryor himself. The theme song was performed by Ray Parker Jr. of Ghostbusters fame, who also appeared in the show's opening credits. The show was also fitted with a laugh track. An uncredited Rick Dees announced the commercial-bumpers for each show. Pryor's Place was broadcast on Saturdays on CBS (at 11:30 AM Eastern/10:30 AM Central) from September 15 to December 8, 1984, with repeats airing until June 15, 1985. Four VHS videotapes were released between September 1997 and June 1998 by Rhino Entertainment, each containing one episode of the series.\n\n Naylor is married with two sons, one of whom (Richard) is a television producer, the other a doctor.

Three years later, he announced that he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He died of a heart attack on December 10, 2005 at the age of 65.\n\n Pryor retired from full-time conducting in 1933. On November 7 of that year, he and Henry W. Herbert were elected to the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders, defeating Director Bryant B. Newcomb and his running mate, Arthur Johnson. Pryor and Herbert would each serve one, three-year term in office. In the 1936 election, they were defeated by Republicans J. Russell Woolley and Edgar O. Murphy. Pryor was married to Maude Russell Pryor. Their son Roger Pryor (1901–1974) also became a bandleader and a film actor. They also had sons Arthur Jr., who became a bandsman and advertising executive, and Samuel Pryor. The senior Pryor suffered a stroke on June 17, 1942, and died on June 18 at his home in West Long Branch, New Jersey. Funeral services were conducted June 21, 1942, at the Trinity Episcopal Church, Asbury Park, followed by burial in Glenwood Cemetery, West Long Branch.\n\n The son of bandmaster Arthur Pryor, Roger Pryor was born in New York City, New York. He had a brother, Arthur Pryor Jr., who was also a bandmaster. Pryor attended the Dwight School in New York.

Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal also retain possession of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The Canary Islands, as well as Ceuta and Melilla and the Plazas de soberania islands in the Mediterranean Sea off the northern coast of Morocco, have long been in Spanish possession since the Reconquista, although Morocco continues to challenge Spain's authority over some of the islands.

Constructed by Spain, its purpose is to prevent smuggling and to stop migrants from entering Europe. Morocco objected to the construction of the barrier since it does not recognize Spanish sovereignty in Ceuta. Ceuta is an integral part of Spain, and therefore of the European Union; its border and its equivalent in Melilla are the only two land borders between the European Union and an African country. The fence consists of parallel 6 metre (20-foot) high fences topped with barbed wire, with regular watchposts and a road running between them to accommodate police patrols or ambulance service in case of need. Underground cables connect spotlights, noise and movement sensors, and video cameras to a central control booth; dozens of guard ships and patrol boats check the coast, while 621 Guardia Civil officers and 548 police officers control the shore.\n\n  The Melilla border fence forms part of the Morocco–Spain border in the city of Melilla, one of two Spanish cities in north Africa.

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. Currently, American English is the most influential form of English worldwide. American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. Any American or Canadian accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called \"General\" or \"Standard\" American, a fairly uniform accent continuum native to certain regions of the U.S. and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single \"mainstream\" American accent. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century.\n\n English is the official language. The Barbudan accent is slightly different from the Antiguan. In the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English. Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from British as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: \"Ent it?\" meaning \"Ain't it?\" which is itself dialectal and means \"Isn't it?\". Common island proverbs can often be traced to Africa. Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.\n\n Australian English (AusE, AusEng, AuE, AuEng, en-AU) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Australia. Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.\n\n English is an official language of Belize, Canada, Nigeria, Falkland Islands, Saint Helena, Malta, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Philippines, Jamaica, Dominica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, American Samoa, Palau, St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, India, Papua New Guinea, Namibia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and former British colonies in Asia, Africa and Oceania.

This has changed with the launch of two new 'South–South banks'. At the sixth summit of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa), in July 2014, the five partners approved the establishment of the New Development Bank (or BRICS Development Bank), with a primary focus on lending for infrastructure projects. It will be based in Shanghai.

In the final document of the 2019 BRICS summit, China and Russia say they \"reiterate the importance of a comprehensive Security Council reform\" and \"support Brazil and India's aspiration for more relevant UN roles\". As stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi in January 2020: \"I would say the Security Council's main shortcoming is the under-representation of developing countries. We reiterate our position that India and Brazil absolutely deserve to be on the council together with an African candidate, our position is that the purpose of the reform is to make sure that the developing countries enjoy a better treatment in the central organ of the United Nations\".\n\n giving it 6.09% of the total vote. To further rebalance power in the IMF, China appealed for changes that would transfer voting power to developing economies. In 2010, the Chinese executive director of the Fund, Zhou Xiaochuan, addressed the board and asserted that giving more power to the emerging economies was critical for the group's legitimacy, accountability and long-term health. China cooperated with other developing countries to advance its rebalancing project. China cooperated with the BRICS, a coalition of the nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. With a larger combined voting share and voice, the BRICS has been more effective at renegotiating IMF governance.\n\n In order to \"maintain order\" both domestically and abroad, China enacts both policies of non-interventionism and interventionism. Being the world's second largest aid donor, China uses economic policies to intervene internationally, providing developmental aid to over 100 countries, especially to nations sanctioned by Western governments. Both the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank lend more in volume to developing nations than all G7 nations combined and more than the World Bank. As China has grown, it has positioned itself to change international networks instead of remaining neutral and to protect its interests abroad, especially in a post-Cold War era. Chinese scholars have increasingly advocated for interventionist policies to protect Chinese interests in a globalized international community.\n\nQuestion: what international organizations is china part of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He also won another Finals Most Valuable Player Award in 1985. He won a total of six Most Valuable Player Award, the most in the history of the NBA. He also held the record for the most All-Star Game selections with 19 and the most All-NBA Team selections with 15. Furthermore, he was selected to eleven All-Defensive Teams, the second most selections.

A 1998 merger between Sony-Loews and Cineplex Odeon Corporation caused them to become part of the new Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. Magic Johnson worked with Lawrence Ruisi, CEO of Loews Cineplex Entertainment, during the planning and development of these theaters.. Currently the chain's former locations are owned by AMC Theatres, after Sony-Loews was acquired by that company in 2006. Although they are still branded Magic Johnson Theatres, they are solely controlled by AMC. Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Jr., is no longer actively involved in the management committee, strategic planning, operations, or public relations.\n\n The seeds of the 1984 Finals were first sown five years earlier, during the 1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Larry Bird and his erstwhile unbeaten Indiana State Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson and his Michigan State Spartans by the score of 75–64. After the tournament, both entered the NBA in the 1979–80 season with high expectations. Bird, who was selected 6th in the 1978 NBA draft but committed back to Indiana State for his senior season, was named Rookie of the Year after leading the Celtics to a 32-game turnaround from the previous year, going from 29 to 61 wins. The expected Celtics–Lakers finals, however, never happened. The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Celtics in the conference finals before losing to the Lakers in the 1980 NBA Finals, with Johnson earning Finals MVP honors for his Game 6 performance. Since then Bird won a championship in 1981, then Magic led the Lakers to the finals in 1982 and 1983, winning in the former.\n\n Upon graduating from Detroit Henry Ford High School in 1975, Kelser was brought to Michigan State by Gus Ganakas, who left the head coach position after Kelser's freshman season. His impressive on-court skills earned him the sobriquet \"Special K\", after the locally-made cereal. In his junior year (the freshman year for Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Jay Vincent) under coach Jud Heathcote, the Spartans squad had an impressive season, racking up a 25–5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA tournament, where they made it to the regional finals before losing narrowly to eventual champion Kentucky. As a senior, he along with Johnson led the Spartans to the 1979 NCAA tournament championship, the first in the school's history. He was often on the receiving end of spectacular alley-oop passes from Johnson. He later wrote a book about his basketball experiences at MSU. Kelser finished his career at Michigan State as a 2-time Academic All-American, something he credits Jud Heathcote for keeping him on task to achieve. He was the very first Big-10 player, and remains the only player in Spartan basketball history, to score over 2,000 points with over 1,000 rebounds.\n\n Marques Kevin Johnson (born February 8, 1956) is an American former professional basketball player who is a basketball analyst for the Milwaukee Bucks on Fox Sports Net.

Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell.

This came about because the delegates saw the need to structure the government in such a way to prevent the imposition of tyranny by either majority or minority. James Madison proposed this governmental scheme so that the power and influence of each branch would be balanced by those of the others. The separation of powers is a result of Congress passing laws, the president enforcing laws, and the courts interpreting the laws. The three branches of government are independent from each other, yet cooperate by necessity. In the Federalist Paper No. 51, Madison illustrated his beliefs on how a balance in the power was necessary for a government to exist. These ideas originated in the work of French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu who described these concepts in his book The Spirit of the Laws (1748). Here Montesquieu explained how these checks on powers were efficient in preventing tyranny.\n\n John Locke (1632–1704) is often referred to as \"the philosopher of the American Revolution\" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology. Locke's Two Treatises of Government published in 1689 was especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the \"consent of the governed\". In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in \"equality by creation\" and \"rights by creation\". Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The theory of the social contract influenced the belief among many of the Founders that the right of the people to overthrow their leaders was one of the \"natural rights\" of man, should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen. The Americans heavily relied on Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the \"balanced\" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions.\n\n  Étienne-Gabriel Morelly (1717–1778) was a French utopian thinker and novelist. An otherwise \"obscure tax official\", Morelly wrote two books on education and a critique of Montesquieu. As well he is thought to be (perhaps erroneously) the author of The Code of Nature, which was published anonymously in France in 1755. This book, a basis of thought for later socialist and Communist thinkers, criticized the society of his day, promoted a social order without avarice and proposed a constitution intended to lead to an egalitarian society without property, marriage, church or police.\n\n  French philosophy in the 18th century was deeply political. It was heavily imbued with Enlightenment principles and many of its philosophers became critics of church and state and promoters of rationality and progress. These philosophers would come to have a deep influence on the politics and ideologies of France and America. Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755) was a social commentator and political philosopher. His theories deeply influenced the American Founders. His belief that the state powers be separated into legislative, executive, and judicial branches formed the basis for separation of powers under the United States Constitution. In The \n\n Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu (18 January 1689 – 10 February 1755), generally referred to as simply Montesquieu, was a French judge, man of letters, historian, and political philosopher. He is the principal source of the theory of separation of powers, which is implemented in many constitutions throughout the world. He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word \"despotism\" in the political lexicon. His anonymously published The Spirit of the Laws (1748), which was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies, influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in drafting the U.S. Constitution.\n\nQuestion: what did baron de montesquie influence?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Jack Dent claimed in 1979 that a descendant of Chief Wabi (aka \"Big Wabi\") had informed him of the creature which lived in the lake.

Like Bigfoot, a prominent subject within American folklore, supposed evidence of the existence of the skunk ape is based on a number of anecdotal sightings as well as disputed photographs, audio and video recordings, and footprints. The majority of mainstream scientists have historically discounted the existence of the Skunk ape, considering it to be the result of a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal. The Skunk ape has permeated into the popular culture of the southern United States, especially in Florida.\n\n a living animal. Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources including the cultures of indigenous people across the continent, the European wild man figure, and folk tales among loggers, miners, trappers, and prospectors. Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors. Other creatures of relatively similar descriptions are alleged to inhabit various regions throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States; the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia; and the Australian Yowie; all of which, like Bigfoot, are engrained in the cultures of their regions.\n\nBigfoot, also known as \"Sasquatch\", is the name given to an ape-like creature that some believe inhabit mostly forests in the Pacific Northwest region of, and throughout the entirety of, North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid, although descriptions vary depending on location. The height range is about 6 to 10 feet tall with black, dark brown, or dark reddish hair. One of the most famous accounts of Bigfoot is the Patterson-Gimlin film where a supposedly female Bigfoot marches across the screen with giant strides, turns to face the camera, then marches off up a steep hill and into the forest.

The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"\n\n Due to conflict adjacent to the border between the two countries, refugees have crossed the border regularly. The main issue of refugees is from conflict between Indonesian national security forces, and various groups of disaffected groups in West Papua seeking refuge in the Papua New Guinea territory. The subsequent diplomatic issues that have arisen, usually is the refugee flows and border transgressions by Indonesian forces. Its (PNG) proximity and cultural ties to the Indonesian province of Papua means there is potential for a mass influx of West Papuan refugees. Given the continuing political instability and the security situation in Papua, regular revision of PNG's contingency plans and training of GoPNG officials is considered important.\n\n North of Australia is an extensive maritime boundary with Indonesia, Papua New Guinea as well as the small island nations of East Timor, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. It starts in the Indian Ocean, then runs through the Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Torres Strait and ends in the Coral Sea. There is also a maritime border between Australia and Indonesia in the Indian Ocean between Australia's external territory of Christmas Island and the Indonesian island of Java.\n\n The region is 1,200 km from east to west and 736 km from north to south. It has an area of 420,540 km2, which equates to approximately 22% of Indonesia's land area. The border with Papua New Guinea mostly follows the 141st meridian east, with one section defined by the Fly River. The island of New Guinea was once part of the Australian landmass and lies on the continent of Sahul. The collision between the Indo-Australian Plate and Pacific plate resulted in the formation of the Maoke Mountains, which run through the centre of the region and are 600 km long \n\n The Australia–Indonesia border is a maritime boundary running west from the two countries' tripoint maritime boundary with Papua New Guinea in the western entrance to the Torres Straits, through the Arafura Sea and Timor Sea, and terminating in the Indian Ocean. The boundary is, however, broken by the Timor Gap, where Australian and East Timorese territorial waters meet and where the two countries have overlapping claims to the seabed. Australia and Indonesia also share a common maritime border in the Indian Ocean between Australia's overseas territory of Christmas Island and the Indonesian island of Java.

This carried with it the rank of State Secretary in the Reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government. He was to report directly to Hitler, and was independent of both the mayor and the Gauleiter of Berlin. Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to rebuild Berlin. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the Prachtstrasse, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the \"North–South Axis\". At the northern end of the \n\n  Little remains of Speer's personal architectural works, other than the plans and photographs. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, 46 ft high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures proposed as part of Welthauptstadt Germania, Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. The tribune of the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, can also be seen. During the war, the Speer-designed Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. The exterior walls survived, but they were eventually dismantled by the Soviets. Unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the Humboldt University, Mohrenstraße metro station and Soviet war memorials in Berlin.\n\n When Troost died on 21 January 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party's chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess's staff. One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg. It was used for Nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film Triumph of the Will. The building was able to hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight Nazis. Nuremberg was the site of many official Nazi buildings. Many more buildings were planned. If built, the German Stadium would have accommodated 400,000 spectators. Speer modified Werner March's design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris.\n\n Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue, a great triumphal arch, almost 400 ft high and able to fit the Arc de Triomphe inside its opening, was planned. The existing Berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled, and two large new stations built. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans.

A close ally of Adolf Hitler, he was convicted at the Nuremberg trials and sentenced to 20 years in prison. An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg. In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for Berlin. \n\nQuestion: what did albert speer design?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was born into a noble family of Florence, with an independent income. Rustici profited from study of the Medici sculpture in the garden at San Marco, and according to Giorgio Vasari, Lorenzo de' Medici placed him in the studio of Verrocchio, and that after Verrocchio's departure for Venice, he placed himself with Leonardo da Vinci, who had also trained in Verocchio's workshop. He shared lodgings with Leonardo while he was working on the bronze figures for the Florence Baptistry, for which he was ill paid and resolved, according to Vasari, not to work again on a public commission. Moreover, an echo of Leonardo's inspiration is \n\n Leonardo began his artistic career at a very young age, exhibiting his work publicly for the first time at the age of 13. His initial work in drawing drew the attention of talent scouts from DC Comics, Marvel Comics and Heavy Metal magazine. After being introduced to abstraction through reproductions of works by artists like Jackson Pollock and receiving inspiration from the process-based work of post-war American and European artists, Drew decided to focus on his fine arts training and immersed himself in exploring his own sense of abstraction. He then went on to attend Parsons School of Design in New York, and received his BFA from Cooper \n\nLeonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings hold great significance in his exploration of Nature and contribute to his overall legacy as an artist and scientist. These drawings serve as a testament to his deep interest in anatomy and medicine. Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings.\n\nHis anatomical drawings are a remarkable display of his observational skills, meticulous attention to detail, and commitment to scientific accuracy. They demonstrate his ability to dissect and examine cadavers, as well as his keen eye for capturing anatomical structures, proportions, and relationships. These drawings were not merely artistic representations but rather scientific records of his discoveries, reflecting his curiosity to uncover the secrets of the human body.\n\nDa Vinci's anatomical studies were groundbreaking during his time and greatly advanced the understanding of human anatomy. He made several important discoveries, including the first accurate depiction of the human spine and the detailed representation of individual organs and systems. His anatomical drawings laid the foundation for later advancements in medical knowledge and have provided invaluable insights for anatomists, physicians, and scientists throughout history.\n\nFurthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. His understanding of human anatomy enabled him to create more lifelike figures, capturing their grace, movement, and proportions with unparalleled accuracy. The anatomical knowledge he gained improved his ability to portray the human form, leading to the creation of masterpieces such as \"The Last Supper\" and the iconic \"Vitruvian Man.\"\n\nIn addition to his artistic and scientific contributions, da Vinci's anatomical drawings also highlight his multidisciplinary approach as a true \"uomo universale\" or \"universal man.\" These drawings demonstrate his ability to bridge the gap between art and science, showing that the study of nature and the human body were intricately interconnected. Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist.\n\nBy virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form.\n\n  Leonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) was an Italian Renaissance painter and polymath who achieved legendary fame and iconic status within his own lifetime. His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the King of France bore him home like a trophy of war, supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died. Leonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of Plato in Raphael's School of Athens.

Another value of federalism is that the states are much closer to the people, so that they can be more responsive to and effective in resolving the localized concerns of the public. Federalism represented a middle ground by dividing power between the governments of the individual states and the centralized federal government. The Constitution assigns the powers of the federal government to the legislative (Article I), executive (Article II), and judicial (Article III) branches, and the Tenth Amendment provides that those powers not expressly delegated to the federal government are reserved by the States or the people.\n\n Constitutionalism in the United States is a basic value espoused by political parties, activist groups and individuals across a wide range of the political spectrum, that the powers of federal, state and local governments are limited by the Constitution of the United States and that the civil and political rights of citizens should not be violated. As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act, civil asset forfeiture laws, mass surveillance, police checkpoints and militarization of police, while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,  states' rights to determine drug and restroom laws, and federal management of public lands.\n\n of state policy. The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States. Each State Government has the freedom to draft its own laws on subjects classified as state subjects. Laws passed by the Parliament of India and other pre-existing central laws on subjects classified as central subjects are binding on all citizens. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency.\n\n the executive, the judicial, and the legislative. From early in the Constitutional Convention, Madison held the position that the national government should be federal because if it were more extensive in relation to the states, that would increase the \"probability of duration, happiness and good order\". It was not initially clear how the new government would interact with the states, and Madison was in favor of a federal form, \"a political system in which at least two territorial levels of government share sovereign constitutional authority over their respective division and joint share of law-making powers; differently put, neither the federal government nor the relevant federative entities may unilaterally alter one another's powers without a process of constitutional amendment in which both levels of government participate.\" Other alternatives included a confederacy as under the Articles of Confederation or a more strictly national government.\n\n The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law takes precedent over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. After the American Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Constitution's Bill of Rights to state governments. Legislation passed by Congress, an Executive Order of the President, or a decision of federal courts pursuant to the Constitution are federal law. Through the system of checks and balances, it is the Supreme Court makes final decisions regarding federal laws regarding specific cases brought before them. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. federal laws are codified in the United States Code.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us constitution set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A non-violent campaign to end discrimination began in the late 1960s. This civil rights campaign was opposed by loyalists, who accused it of being a republican front. Loyalist opposition was led primarily by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher. They held counter-protests, attacked civil rights marches, and put pressure on moderate unionists. Loyalist militants carried out false flag bombings that were blamed on republicans and civil rights activists. This unrest led to the August 1969 riots. Irish nationalists/republicans clashed with both police and with loyalists, \n\n and gun battles in nationalist districts of Northern Ireland in early July. In the last spell of widespread violence before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998, the RUC and British Army were forced to withdraw entirely from some nationalist areas of Belfast. It was sparked by official permission for an Orange Order march in Portadown, and the RUC's aggressive removal of nationalist protesters who had been blocking the march (the Drumcree conflict). A US citizen, John Helmsworth, was assaulted by an RUC riot squad in the falls area of Belfast, and died six months later from a brain hemorrhage as a consequence of the beating. \n\n of Independence (1919–21) and partition of Ireland: most of Ireland became an independent state, while most of Ulster remained within the United Kingdom as the self-governing territory of Northern Ireland. During partition, communal violence raged between loyalists and Irish nationalists in Belfast, and loyalists attacked the Catholic minority in retaliation for Irish republican activity. Northern Ireland's unionist governments were accused of discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists. Loyalists opposed the Catholic civil rights movement, accusing it of being a republican front. This unrest led to the Troubles (1969–98). During the conflict, loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) often attacked Catholics in retaliation for republican paramilitary actions. \n\n and the vast majority of their victims were random Catholic civilians. During the Troubles there were incidents where some local British soldiers and police colluded with loyalist paramilitaries, such as the attacks by the Glenanne group. Signed in 1973, the Sunningdale Agreement sought to end the conflict by establishing power-sharing government between unionists and Irish nationalists, and ensuring greater co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. In protest, loyalists organized the Ulster Workers' Council strike in May 1974. It was enforced by loyalist paramilitaries and brought large parts of Northern Ireland to a standstill. During the strike, loyalists detonated a series of car \n\n When the Irish Free State was established in 1922 (under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921), six of the island's northern counties opted to remain part of the United Kingdom. For Northern Ireland the decades that followed were marked by tensions and controversies, sometimes spilling over into violence, between unionists who favoured remaining with Britain and nationalists who favoured unification with the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland). Starting in the late 1960s this conflict became more intense and more violent. In the ensuing 30+ year period over 3,500 deaths were attributed to these hostilities which came to be known as The Troubles. Serious political efforts to end the conflict began in the late 1980s and continued through the 1990s. Ceasefires were declared and later broken. The agreement came after very many years of complex talks, proposals, and compromises. Many people made major contributions. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern were leaders of the UK and the Republic of Ireland at the time. The talks were chaired by US special envoy George Mitchell.\n\nQuestion: when did conflict start in ireland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers 4 games to 2. This was the Lakers' first championship in twelve years. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, in arguably one of the best finals performances in history putting up 38 PPG, 16 Rebounds and 2 blocks, his first of three consecutive honors. The series was played under a best-of-seven format, with the Lakers holding home court advantage. The series featured the number one seeds from both conferences.\n\n The 2001 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2000–01 season. The defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers took on the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers for the championship, with the Lakers holding home-court advantage in a best-of-seven format. The Lakers won the series 4 games to 1. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal was named the Most Valuable Player of the series. NBA MVP Allen Iverson scored 48 points in his only NBA Finals victory, as the 76ers took Game 1 107–101 in overtime, handing the Lakers their only loss of the playoffs. However, the Lakers went on to win the next four games, despite being out-shot and out-rebounded in the series. Los Angeles punished Philadelphia with their three-point shooting, which was the key to this series. In Game 3 Robert Horry hit a three-point shot in the last minute, and in the next two games the Lakers used hot 3-point shooting to build big leads and hold off late 76ers comeback attempts in games 4 and 5, pulling away for double-digit wins to win the title.\n\n By 1986, the Lakers were still undefeated against the Clippers, and AP offered that it was \"a crosstown rivalry that hasn't been much of one.\" Lakers fans would outnumber Clippers fans at the Sports Arena during the teams' matchups for years until 1992, when the Clippers had their first winning season since 1978–79 and their first playoff appearance since 1976. The Lakers, on the other hand, struggled in 1991–92 with Lakers great Magic Johnson's retirement after he tested positive for HIV. The Clippers ended a 27-game Forum losing streak against the Lakers that season, and they finished with a better record than the Lakers. They again finished ahead of the Lakers in 1992–93. They also \n\n Lakers in Anaheim. A deal to move the Clippers to Anaheim on a permanent basis was declined by the team in 1996, leading to the eventual decision to have the Clippers join the Lakers at the Staples Center when it opened in 1999. The Clippers did not finish ahead of the Lakers again until 2004–05. Lakers star Kobe Bryant almost joined the Clippers that season as a free agent before re-signing with the Lakers. The Clippers in 2005–06 won 47 games and finished two games ahead of the Lakers. During the season, Bryant said that \"rivalries are made in the playoffs, not in the regular season\". In the 2006 playoffs, the Lakers built a 3–1 \n\n In Game 1, the Nets stayed within striking distance, but Shaquille O'Neal's 36 points and 16 rebounds led the Lakers to victory. In Game 2, the Nets were blown out by 23, with O'Neal leading the way again, putting up 40 points and 12 rebounds and coming within 2 assists of a triple double. This brought the series to New Jersey with the Lakers up 2-0. Game 3 was a close matchup with Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin, O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant all scoring 26 or more points. Bryant and O'Neal's combined 71 points was too much for the Nets to handle though, and the Lakers took a 3-0 series lead. In Game 4, O'Neal put up 34 points and the Lakers won the game and the championship, accomplishing the NBA's second three-peat in seven years. Game 4 is Mitch Richmond's final NBA game.

The Vulgate, completed by Jerome and revised multiple times, had formed the textual basis for all Catholic vernacular translations until then. Divino afflante Spiritu inaugurated the modern period of Roman Catholic biblical studies by encouraging the study of textual criticism (or lower criticism), pertaining to text of the Scriptures themselves and transmission thereof (for example, to determine correct readings) and permitted the use of the historical-critical method (or higher criticism), to be informed by theology, Sacred Tradition, and ecclesiastical history on the historical circumstances of the text, hypothesizing about matters such as authorship, dating, and similar concerns. The eminent Catholic biblical scholar Raymond E. Brown described it as a \"Magna Carta for biblical progress\".\n\n arrive at a deeper and fuller knowledge of the meaning of the sacred texts: \"We ought to explain the original text which was written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and greater weight than any, even the very best, translation whether ancient or modern. This can be done all the more easily and fruitfully if to the knowledge of languages be joined a real skill in literary criticism of the same text.\" Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church.\n\n the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 825.1, the NRSV with the deuterocanonical books received the Imprimatur of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, meaning that the NRSV (Catholic Edition) is officially approved by the Catholic Church and can be profitably used by Catholics in private study and devotional reading. The New Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition also has the imprimatur, granted on 12 September 1991 and 15 October 1991, respectively. For public worship, such as at weekly Mass, most Catholic Bishops Conferences in English-speaking countries require the use of other translations, either the adapted New American Bible in the dioceses of the United States and the Philippines or the English Standard Version and Revised New Jerusalem Bible in most \n\n The Council of Trent on April 8, 1546, approved the enforcement of the present Catholic Bible canon including the deuterocanonical books as an article of faith and the decision was confirmed by an anathema by vote (24 yea, 15 nay, 16 abstain). The canonical books list is the same as produced following the Council of Florence (Session 11, 4 February 1442). \"Of the Old Testament, the five books of Moses, namely, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Josue, Judges, Ruth, the four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two of Paralipomenon [1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles], the first and second of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, the Davidic \n\n Latin translation. This placement and numbering system is used in Catholic Bible translations based primarily on the Vulgate, such as the Douay–Rheims Bible and the Knox Bible. In contrast, the 1979 revision of the Vulgate, the Nova Vulgata, incorporates the additions to Esther directly into the narrative itself, as do most modern Catholic English translations based on the original Hebrew and Greek (e.g., Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, New American Bible, New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition). The numbering system for the additions differs with each translation. The Nova Vulgata accounts for the additional verses by numbering them as extensions of the verses immediately following or preceding them (e.g., Esther 11:2–12 in \n\nQuestion: what bible do catholics follow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1877, the Sisters who had migrated to Peoria were granted permission to form an independent religious community and became \"The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, Peoria, Illinois\".\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the Medical Center built a new emergency room. A new Children's Hospital of Illinois was built, with a new Level I pediatric and a Level III neonatal intensive care unit (the only one in Central Illinois) and emergency room. The Milestone Project was the largest expansion in the hospital's history. The hospital is now home to nearly all pediatric and adult services.\n\nAbout \nThe hospital offers adult and pediatric renal transplantation and adult pancreatic transplantation; most of the time, adult, and especially, pediatric, cardiac transplantation cases are referred to tertiary care academic medical transplantation centers in Chicago or St. Louis, though there are facilities and surgeons and physicians available for cardiac transplantation at the center's Heart Institute and at the Children's Hospital, and they have been performed there repeatedly. The hospital offers advanced burn care, hyperbaric, and debridement and grafting services for both children and adults, and sometimes, if need be, can transfer very severe cases to the certified state burn units in Springfield, Chicago or St. Louis.\n\nThe center's new Jump Trading Simulation & Education Center is used for bioengineering, biochemical research, research on new devices and tissues and grafts, and medical and nursing and bioengineering training.\n\nOrganization\nThe Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis (led by Sister Judith Ann Duvall, O.S.F.) is established as a non-profit organization and is the parent company of OSF Healthcare, which in turn is the operator of the OSF Healthcare System. The religious order of nuns and the hospital is not considered a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, but still works closely with it.  The System consists of 13 facilities in Illinois, including the center, plus one in Escanaba, Michigan.\n\nAwards\nIn 2000, the center was listed among the \"Most Wired Hospitals and Health Systems\" by Hospitals & Health Networks, an indicator of the degree to which information technology was used in the center.\n\nThe center received a Lantern Award in 2013 for nursing care in the emergency department. The center is also the #1 hospital in the state of Illinois for organ recovery. In 2017, it was ranked fifth by U.S. News & World Report in three-way tie for the state's top hospitals.\n\nChildren's Hospital of Illinois \n\nChildren's Hospital of Illinois (CHOI) is a nationally ranked pediatric acute care hospital located within OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois. The hospital has 144 beds. It is affiliated with The University of Illinois College of Medicine, and is a member of OSF Health. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout Central Illinois. CHOI also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. Children's Hospital of Illinois features the only pediatric Level 1 Trauma Center in the region, and 1 of 4 in the state.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n  Note: AccessMyLibrary requires registration to view full content; URL provided gives first paragraph of article.\n  Note: HighBeam Research requires subscription to view full content; URL provided gives first paragraph of article.\n\nExternal links\n OSF Saint Francis Medical Center — official site\n OSF Saint Francis video\n\nCompanies based in Peoria, Illinois\nBuildings and structures in Peoria, Illinois\nOSF HealthCare\nTeaching hospitals in Illinois\nMedical schools in Illinois\n1876 establishments in Illinois\nHospitals in Illinois\n\nQuestion: what is there to do in peoria illinois?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\n A national identity of the English as the people or ethnic group native to England developed in the Middle Ages arguably beginning with the unification of the Kingdom of England in the 10th century, but explicitly in the 11th century after the Norman Conquest, when Englishry came to be the status of the subject indigenous population. From the eighteenth century the terms 'English' and 'British' began to be seen as interchangeable to many of the English. While the official United Kingdom census does record ethnicity, English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British is a single tick-box under the \"White\" heading for the answer to the ethnicity question asked in England and Wales (while making the distinction of white Irish).

The language also spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonisation and the spread of the former British Empire, which, by 1921, included 470–570 million people, about a quarter of the world's population. Written forms of British and American English as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional noticeable differences. Over the past 400 years, the forms of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United \n\n According to the 2011 Census, Portuguese is the tenth most commonly spoken language in England and Wales, with 133,453 speakers.

Kriolu is a Portuguese-African creole language originating in Cape Verde.\n\n Dialects and accents vary amongst the four countries of the United Kingdom, as well as within the countries themselves. The major divisions are normally classified as English English (or English as spoken in England, which encompasses Southern English dialects, West Country dialects, East and West Midlands English dialects and Northern English dialects), Ulster English (in Northern Ireland), Welsh English (not to be confused with the Welsh language), and Scottish English (not to be confused with the Scots language or Scottish Gaelic language). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages.

As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. Delectorskaya also coordinated the four years of preparation and installation that went into the chapel at Vence, just outside Nice, which he flooded with blue and yellow light. The stained glass windows in the Chapelle du Rosaire in Vence, and the colored paper cutouts (Lydia had recruited female assistants to mix gouache paint to his instruction to cover the countless sheets of paper required) \"now generally agreed to be among the greatest inventions of the 20th century.\" Now 84, Matisse died on 3 November 1954. The day before, when she came to his sickbed, Matisse made a last drawing – it was of her, using a ball-point pen.\n\n and later in the U.S. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. Hofmann was a young artist working in Paris who painted there before World War I. Hofmann worked in Paris with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists \n\n Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (, ; ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist. Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. Gauguin was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.\n\n the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red. He even tried, without success, to persuade the older and more traditional Renoir, his neighbor in the south of France, to switch from vermilion to cadmium red. Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. \"A certain blue penetrates your soul\", he wrote. \"A certain red affects your blood pressure.\" He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. \n\n A painter of dream-like maidens and \"frieze-like idylls,\" he was most often compared to the French artist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. His involvement with the Armory Show and prolonged exposure to European Modernism, however, changed his outlook utterly. As art historian Sam Hunter wrote, \"[One] could scarcely have guessed that the bold colors of Matisse and the radical simplifications of the Cubists would engage Davies' sympathies,\" but so they did. His subsequent work attempted to merge stronger color and a Cubist sense of structure and Cubist forms with his on-going preoccupation with the female body, delicate movement, and an essentially romantic outlook (e.g., Day of Good Fortune, in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.) \"Mr. \n\nQuestion: what type of artist is henri matisse?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The bedroom where Hogarth died is now part of the Charles Dickens Museum. As a result of Hogarth's death, Charles Dickens missed the publication dates for The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. It was the only time in his life that Dickens missed publication dates. As a reason for missing the publication dates, he wrote that \"he had lost a very dear young relative to whom he was most affectionately attached, and whose society has been, for a long time, the chief solace of his labours\". He wore Hogarth's ring for the rest of his life, and also requested a locket of her hair. Eight months after Hogarth's death, Charles and Catherine Dickens' second child and first daughter was born. Charles demanded that the child be named Mary, in memory of Hogarth.\n\n The Uncommercial Traveller is a collection of literary sketches and reminiscences written by Charles Dickens, published in 1860–1861. In 1859 Dickens founded a new journal called All the Year Round, and the \"Uncommercial Traveller\" articles would be among his main contributions. He seems to have chosen the title and persona of the Uncommercial Traveller as a result of a speech he gave on 22 December 1859 to the Commercial Travellers' School London in his role as honorary chairman and treasurer. The persona sits well with a writer who liked to travel, not only as a tourist, but also to research and report what he found visiting Europe, America and giving book readings throughout Britain. He did not seem content to rest late in his career when he had attained wealth and comfort and continued travelling locally, walking the streets of London in the mould of the flâneur, a \"gentleman stroller of city streets\". He often suffered from insomnia and his night-time wanderings gave him an insight into some of the hidden aspects of Victorian London, details of which he also incorporated into his novels.\n\n Dickens began by writing seventeen episodes, which were printed in All the Year Round between 28 January and 13 October 1860 and these were published in a single edition in 1861. He sporadically produced eleven more articles between 1863–65 and an expanded edition of the work was printed in 1866. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875. The work is not markedly different from articles he contributed to Household Words, an earlier journal, or the contents of Sketches by Boz written near the start of his literary career.

She produced long series of books featuring detective characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, amongst others. Her use of basing her stories on complex puzzles, “combined with her stereotyped characters and picturesque middle-class settings”, is credited for her success.

An All-Big Eight guard who played collegiately at the University of Kansas, Jordan was the starting point guard during the school's 1991 and 1993 Final Four appearances. Together with shooting guard teammate Rex Walters, the two established Kansas as having one of the top backcourts in the NCAA during the 1992–93 season. He was later drafted in the 1993 NBA Draft but only appeared in only 10 career games in the league (six with the Denver Nuggets during the 1993–94 season and four with the Milwaukee Bucks during the lockout-shortened 1999 NBA season). He spent the bulk of his professional career playing overseas with various basketball clubs.\n\n The 1984–85 Chicago Bulls season was the 19th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the summer of 1984, the team's fortunes changed when it received the third pick of the NBA draft, after Houston and Portland. The Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon, the Blazers selected Sam Bowie, and the Bulls picked shooting guard Michael Jordan out of the University of North Carolina. The team, with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause in the front office, decided to rebuild around Jordan.

The sentiments of revolution put forth in the Declaration were already well established in 1776 as the colonies were already at war with the British when the Declaration was being debated, drafted and signed. Before the Declaration was drafted, Jefferson served as a delegate from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress beginning in June 1775, soon after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. He sought out John Adams who, along with his cousin Samuel, had emerged as a leader of the convention. Jefferson and Adams established a lifelong \n\n have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \"manifesto\" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\" Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time, \n\n In April 1776, the North Carolina Provincial Congress issued the Halifax Resolves explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence. By June, nine Provincial Congresses were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. Richard Henry Lee was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On June 11, a committee was created by the Second Continental Congress to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The Declaration of Independence was drafted largely by Thomas Jefferson and presented by the committee; it was unanimously adopted by \n\n remain as British subjects loyal to the king. When the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in May 1775, deliberations conducted by notable figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and John Adams resulted in a decision for full independence. Thus, the Declaration of Independence, unanimously ratified on 4 July 1776, was a radical and decisive break. The United States of America became the first colony in the world to successfully achieve independence in the modern era. According to R. R.

The arc consists of a series of Quaternary age stratovolcanoes that grew on top of pre-existing geologic materials that ranged from Miocene volcanics to glacial ice. The Cascade Volcanic arc is located approximately 100 km inland from the coast, and forms a north-to-south chain of peaks that \n\n On May 18, 1980, the upper 400 metres (1,300 feet) of Mount St. Helens collapsed, creating a landslide. This released the pressure on the magma trapped beneath the summit bulge which exploded as a lateral blast, which then released the pressure on the magma chamber and resulted in a plinian eruption. One lobe of the avalanche surged onto Spirit Lake, causing a megatsunami which pushed the lake waters in a series of surges, which reached a maximum height of 260 metres (853 feet) above the pre-eruption water level (~975 m asl/3,199 ft). Above the upper limit of the tsunami, trees lie where they were knocked down by the pyroclastic surge; below the limit, the fallen trees and the surge deposits were removed by the megatsunami and deposited in Spirit Lake.\n\n over 3,000 m (10,000 ft) in elevation. The major peaks from south to north include: The most active volcanoes in the chain include Mount St. Helens, Mount Baker, Lassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Mount Hood. Mount St. Helens captured worldwide attention when it erupted catastrophically in 1980. St. Helens continues to rumble, albeit more quietly, emitting occasional steam plumes and experiencing small earthquakes, both signs of continuing magmatic activity. Most of the volcanoes have a main, central vent from which the most recent eruptions have occurred. The peaks are composed of layers of solidified andesitic to dacitic magma, and the more siliceous (and explosive) rhyolite.\n\n St. Helens is the county seat of Columbia County, Oregon. It was founded by Captain Henry Montgomery Knighton, a native of New England, in 1845, as \"Plymouth\". The name was changed to St. Helens in the latter part of 1850 for its view of Mount St. Helens, roughly 39 mi away in Washington. The city is about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Portland.

Data collected at several locations from four previous eruptions which occurred during the last 1600 years indicate that a new eruption would last several years, putting at risk population and costly infrastructure in the areas surrounding the volcano. Typical events during such volcanic episodes include pyroclastic flows, super-heated gas clouds rapidly descending the volcano's east flank, conceivably reaching as far as Boquete, Alto Boquete, and the Caldera River, and fallout of ash and other particles ranging in size from dust to 1-meter blocks, known as tephra, causing fires, roof collapses, water \n\nQuestion: where is mount st helens volcano?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The directing of over 200 hours of television followed, including multiple episodes of New York Undercover, The Pretender, House, 24, CSI: Miami,  Boomtown,  Numb3rs, Life and Blue Bloods. He has also been either the Producer or Supervising Producer on a number of shows including The Pretender, Boomtown and Blue Bloods. Most recently he returned to short form with the pilot for the series Weight which won the 2016 WGA Award for Short Form New Media-Original. In addition to his film and television career Keller has also directed numerous plays and two operas.\n\n An earlier version of the script did not feature the investigation side-plot set around Detective Sandra Cassidy. Although the film is entirely set in New York, shooting took place in winter 2000 in both New York and Toronto. Due to the film's release nearly three weeks after the September 11 attacks, the filmmakers contemplated delaying the movie, but ultimately decided against it. However, they moved to quickly cut out and replace shots of the World Trade Center from the edit, such as the opening shot, which now instead shows Brooklyn.\n\n The series is filmed in New York City.\n\n Filming for the series takes place at New York City area hospitals including Bellevue Hospital and its surrounding area, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Woodhull Hospital, and Kings County Hospital Center. By October 2018, Universal Television had paid NYC Health + Hospitals, the corporation that oversees New York City's public hospitals, US$665,000 to film in the hospitals.

The Vigil also honored who have died in jail and the thousands of people in L.A. jails. People laid flowers outside the Hall of Justice during the vigil. The idea was inspired by Tupac Shakur's poem entitled The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection).\n\n The song was written by 2Pac for fellow Death Row rapper M.C. Hammer. 2Pac recorded a demo of it himself before giving the song to Hammer, this demo is what was used for songs release. Hammer's version was first released on Family Affair in 1998. Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2004. According to the Family Affair album insert, \"Unconditional Love\" lyrics were written and arranged by 2Pac and the songs producer, Johnny \"J\". Johnny \"J\" was credited for producing both versions of the song. Hammer wrote this about the song: \"This song was given to me as a gift from the late Tupac Shakur. He told me this was a song about how true love is unconditional. He wanted me to rap it because it reflected what I stand for. The secret is this is also what he stood for. We know that our Bible says that God's love is unconditional. Thank you Tupac for this beautiful, spiritual song.\" Hammer would later go on to mention his friendship with Tupac and the gift of this song to him in a TBN interview.\n\n \"Pac's Life\" is a single written and performed by American rappers Tupac Shakur and T.I and R&B singer Ashanti, produced by L. T. Hutton for Shakur's posthumously released album of the same name. It is a hip hop and R&B song; the second Tupac verse was recycled from a song titled \"This Life I Lead\". T.I. said in an interview that working on the song was an honor, as he idolized him while growing up. The single peaked at #1 on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles in the December 2, 2006 issue of Billboard magazine. It was also a top ten hit in Ireland and peaked at number 21 in the UK. On MTV Australia, \"Pac's Life\" peaked at the number 1 spot on the Hip Hop Countdown, beating new releases from Jay-Z, Eminem and 50 Cent, and Nas. The original version of the song samples Prince's \"Pop Life\" and is a minute and 34 seconds in duration, with some speculating it might have been cut off when it was initially leaked. It first features Tupac's verse and Tupac singing the hook.\n\n The Rose That Grew from Concrete is a posthumous album based on the poetry/writings of Tupac Shakur, released on November 21, 2000. This album features a large cast of celebrities reading Shakur's poetry and writing, much in the spirit of a traditional spoken word album. 2Pac is featured on the song \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". These vocals were remixed onto the track from the 2Pac song entitled \"Mama's Just a Little Girl\" that was recorded in 1996 and released in 2002 on the album \"Better Dayz\". It has sold 262,672 copies in the United States as of 2011.\n\n Tupac Shakur Legacy is an official interactive biography of Tupac Shakur released on August 16, 2006. The author of the book is Jamal Joseph, a friend of the Shakur family and a former Black Panther Party member. The book is published by Atria Books a division of Simon & Schuster. It features unseen family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 removable reproductions of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other personal papers. The book includes a 60-minute interview CD with Tupac along with many reproductions.

Continuing the previous example for comparison, using Classical Chinese it would be: Because Chinese's logographic writing system doesn't indicate exact pronunciation, the pronunciation of Classical Chinese in Old Chinese is generally not possible (though tentative reconstructions of the phonology of Old Chinese have been attempted). Instead, Classical Chinese is also generally pronounced according to the local dialect (such as the Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations given above), much like how Cantonese speakers pronounce the modern Mandarin-based written Chinese using Cantonese. Unlike the situation with modern Chinese, however, Classical Chinese spoken according to the pronunciations of the modern spoken Chinese varieties is still largely unintelligible without training due to the syntax and vocabulary changes that Chinese has undergone since Old Chinese. In addition, sound mergers in the modern dialects cause many distinct words in Classical Chinese to sound homophonous. For one notable example, see Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den.\n\nNote: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. Cantonese romanized using Yale.  Written Cantonese shown uses characters not in standard written Chinese. After the adoption of vernacular Chinese as the modern standard written language in the early 20th century, diglossia was no longer a big issue among the majority of Chinese speakers who learn Mandarin Chinese as the standard national dialect. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. Unique among the other Chinese language varieties, Cantonese has its own written form, but it is largely used in informal contexts, such as \n\n Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as Guānhuà (官話/官话, literally 'speech of officials'). Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined. In the early years of the Republic of China, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and one of the official languages of Singapore. Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. Outside China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\n For over two thousand years, the Chinese used Classical Chinese (Literary Chinese) as a formal standard written language. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. However, the colloquial varieties of Chinese continued to evolve. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication.\n\n communication, internet slang, advertising, music, and film. Literate Chinese speakers can read and write in the Mandarin-based standard written language. However, because the graphemes in Chinese's logographic writing system are not directly linked to pronunciation (though there are quasi-phonetic hints), Cantonese speakers who do not speak Mandarin will read aloud the characters in Cantonese pronunciation only. The resulting speech is Mandarin-based grammar and vocabulary pronounced word-by-word in Cantonese. If the same sentence were to be spoken using regular colloquial Cantonese, it might be quite different. Here is an example:  In the above example, note the switching of the direct and indirect objects and the use of different vocabulary for certain words in the standard Chinese and colloquial Cantonese renditions. In addition, Cantonese grammar allows the use of classifiers to serve in the place of a genitive particle.\n\nQuestion: what language do chinese people write in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In a United States Geological Survey (USGS) report in 1900, Josiah Edward Spurr refers to \"the giant mountain variously known to Americans as Mount Allen, Mount McKinley, or Bulshaia, the latter being a corruption of the Russian adjective meaning big.\" The 1900 report otherwise calls it Mount McKinley, as does the 1911 USGS report The Mount McKinley Region, Alaska. McKinley was assassinated early in his second term, shot by Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, and dying of his wounds on September 14. This led to sentiment favoring commemoration of his memory, and the Federal government officially adopted the name Mount McKinley in 1917, when Congress passed and President Woodrow Wilson signed into law \"An Act to establish the Mount McKinley National Park in the territory of Alaska\" (Public Act No. 353).\n\n \"President McKinley has made it pretty hard for the rest of us husbands here in Washington,\" remarked Senator Mark Hanna. The First Lady often traveled with the President. Mrs. McKinley traveled to California with the President in May 1901, but became so ill in San Francisco that the planned tour of the Northwest was cancelled. She was also with him on the trip to Buffalo, New York in September of that year when he was assassinated, but was not present at the shooting. On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot in the stomach by a 28-year-old anarchist named Leon Czolgosz. Doctors were unable to locate the bullet. The President's wound eventually became infected with gangrene. He died eight days after the shooting, aged 58.\n\n In 1901, while attending the Pan-American Exposition, President William McKinley was shot twice at close range by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Although early doctor's reports on the President's condition were positive, McKinley's condition soon worsened: while Vice President Theodore Roosevelt rushed back to Buffalo, he was informed on arrival that McKinley had died. It was decided to conduct the inauguration immediately, due to the tragic and politically charged circumstances of President McKinley's death. The most appropriate site was determined to be the Wilcox home. Approximately 50 dignitaries, family members and cabinet officials gathered in the front library for the inauguration, while Federal Judge John R. Hazel administered the oath. No photographic image exists of the ceremony itself, although the room was heavily photographed after the inauguration had concluded.\n\n McKinley served in the Alabama House of Representatives from 1820 to 1822. In 1826, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, completing the term of Henry H. Chambers, who died in office. McKinley served from November 27, 1826 to March 3, 1831. He was again elected to the Senate in 1837, but served only from March 4, 1837 until his resignation on April 22. McKinley left the Senate to accept a recess appointment from President Martin Van Buren to a newly created seat (one of two which had been created by Congress – 5 Stat. 176) on the Supreme Court. Formally nominated on September 18, 1837, McKinley was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1837, and received his commission the same day. McKinley served on the Supreme Court for fourteen years. McKinley owned twelve slaves at the time of the 1850 census. He died in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1852, at the age of 72.\n\n  The assassination of United States president William McKinley took place at 4:07 p.m. on Friday, September 6, 1901, at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York. McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to gangrene setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901, at 2:15 a.m. Members \n\nQuestion: when did william mckinley died?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

With an average depth of 10 feet (3 meters), Lake Ovid is generally fairly shallow, with depths never exceeding 23 feet (7 meters). Many freshwater fish live in the lake including Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, Rock Bass, Crappie, Channel Catfish, Muskellunge (Muskie), and Northern Pike. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been monitoring the fish population annually and has determined that the smaller species of panfish have been reproducing prolifically and future stocking is going to focus on Muskellunge and Catfish. These predatory species have plenty to eat in the lake and an increase in their numbers \n\n Lake Chillisquaque are fairly shallow. Most of Heron Cove is less than 10 ft deep and a large area near the lake's boat ramp is approximately 20 ft deep. The deepest parts of the lake, near the lake's dam, are 40 ft deep. Lake Chillisquaque has a number of coves, including Heron Cove and the nearby Jellyfish Cove. Goose Cove is another cove on the lake. It is located in the lake's northwestern section. There are numerous other smaller coves and bays. Numerous objects, including tire reefs and cement blocks, have been placed in Lake Chillisquaque to increase its suitability as a fish habitat. There are also basking platforms for turtles on the lake.\n\n Many reptiles make the habitat around the lake their home; the snakes are garter snake, fox snake and northern water snakes. There are turtles such as: painted turtles, snapping turtles, musk turtles, red-eared sliders, yellow-bellied sliders, and northern map turtles. There have been many reports of an enormous snapping turtle, dubbed by local residents as \"Colossal\", with a carapace length of 3 feet (1 m). It was lured onto shore by two local residents in the summer of 2017, the only reported time it had been captured, but was not officially measured. There was a turtle slightly larger, almost 5 feet, but it died during the winter of 2004–2005. There are also many birds such as gulls, herons, sparrows, red-winged blackbirds, geese and ducks. The lake area is a favorite spot for children: they sport fish off of the Blue Heron Lake bridge and other areas around the lake. There are many fish in the lake such as sunfish, bluegill, pumpkinseed, perch, bass, koi, pike, minnows, shad, carp and catfish. It has been confirmed that there is a muskellunge in Blue Heron Lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 8 m.\n\n of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable features. It was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge in 1870. Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake.

Holcomb ran against the Democratic nominee, former Health Commissioner of Indiana Woody Myers, and his running mate Linda Lawson, the former Minority Leader of the Indiana House of Representatives. Donald Rainwater, a U.S. Navy veteran, was the Libertarian nominee. Primaries were held on June 2, although both Holcomb and Myers ran uncontested. Holcomb won the election in a landslide, though Libertarian Donald Rainwater's 11% of the vote was the highest percentage of vote for a third-party candidate in any of the 2020 gubernatorial race, and the highest any Libertarian candidate ever received in Indiana in a three-party race (The 2006 United States Senate election in Indiana saw the Libertarian candidate take 12.6% of the vote, but there was no Democratic candidate running).\n\n One-term incumbent Governor Mike Pence announced his bid for re-election. Pence won in 2012 with 49.6% of the vote. Pence previously served as a U.S. Representative from 2001 to 2013 and was Chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011. Pence had expressed interest in running for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, but declined. However, Pence withdrew his bid for a second term on July 15, 2016, to run for vice president as running mate to Donald Trump. Pence was replaced as the gubernatorial nominee by Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb. The 2012 Democratic nominee, former State House Speaker John R. Gregg, won the Democratic nomination. State Representative Karen Tallian and Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz both withdrew their candidacies. State Representative Terri Austin, South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg, former Lieutenant Governor Kathy Davis, \n\n The 2024 Indiana gubernatorial election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the Governor of Indiana, concurrently with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican Governor Eric Holcomb is term-limited and cannot seek re-election to a third term in office.\n\n  In May 2011, Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012. Incumbent Republican Governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. Pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels. The Democratic nominee was former Indiana Speaker of the House John R. Gregg. Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of Gregg, with Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham receiving most of the remaining votes. Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.\n\n The governor of Indiana is the head of government of the State of Indiana. The governor is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many agencies of the Indiana state government. The governor also shares power with other statewide executive officers, who manage other state government agencies. The governor works out of the Indiana Statehouse and holds official functions at the Indiana Governor's Residence in the state capital of Indianapolis. The 51st, and current, governor is Republican Eric Holcomb, who took office on January 9, 2017. The position of the governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states.\n\nQuestion: who is the next governor of indiana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The neoclassical works of Ferruccio Busoni would figure prominently in his later work, but his biggest influence would be the ideas of the Second Viennese School, which he encountered in the 1930s, particularly Alban Berg \n\n Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. Roger Nichols writes that \"if one omits Schoenberg [...] a list of 20th-century composers influenced by Debussy is practically a list of 20th-century composers tout court.\" Bartók first encountered Debussy's music in 1907 and later said that \"Debussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities\". Not only Debussy's use of whole-tone scales, but also his style of word-setting in Pelléas et Mélisande, were the subject of study by Leoš Janáček while he was writing his 1921 opera Káťa Kabanová. Stravinsky was more ambivalent about Debussy's music (he thought Pelléas \"a terrible bore ... in spite of many wonderful pages\") but the two composers knew each \n\n a little pagan mystical note\". The work is dedicated to composer Paul Dukas. Debussy sent his music score to the Académie des beaux-arts as an entry for the Prix de Rome. It was published in 1892. Debussy revised his orchestration for the piece in 1902, and in 1906 made a piano reduction of the orchestral part. La Damoiselle élue belongs to the same period of composition as the Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire, when Debussy was influenced by the music of Richard Wagner. The composer chose to distance himself from this musical influence, while remaining faithful to symbolist literature, when composing his opera Pelléas et Mélisande in the 1890s. Patterns such as fleur-de-lys returned to \n\n Butterfly are among the most popular and well-recognised in the repertoire today. ; Gustave Charpentier (1860–1956). French composer famous for a single opera, Louise, set in a working class district of Paris. ; Claude Debussy (1862–1918). Like Beethoven, Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of Maeterlinck's Symbolist play Pelléas et Mélisande is a key work in 20th century music drama. In many ways an \"anti-opera\", Pelléas contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the première had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today. \n\n Claude Debussy's Reflets dans l'eau (\"Reflections in the Water\") is the first of three piano pieces from his first volume of Images, which are frequently performed separately. It was written in 1905. As with much of Debussy's work, it is referred to as Impressionistic, meaning that it expresses emotions and senses by making use of non-functional harmony and ambiguous key signatures, its tonality being mainly non-diatonic and usually having a sense of modality.\n\nQuestion: what type of music did claude debussy play?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs, but Vachon now had a permanent spot on the Canadiens roster. Punch Imlach, the coach of the Leafs, referred to Vachon as a junior B goaltender in an attempt to rattle him during the Stanley Cup finals. Vachon played 39 games in the 1967–68 season and won 23 of them. He and Worsley shared the Vezina Trophy, with a combined 2.26 GAA, the lowest since 1958-59. Montreal won the Stanley Cup that season and in 1968–69 as well.

A decline in confidence in the Russian economy caused investors to sell off their Russian assets, which led to a decline in the value of the Russian ruble and sparked fears of a Russian financial crisis.

In the 16th century, the time of first contact with Spanish explorers and colonists, the Guaycuru people lived in the present-day countries of Argentina (north of Santa Fe Province), Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil (south of Corumbá). The name is written guaycurú or guaicurú in Spanish (plural guaycurúes or guaicurúes), and guaicuru in Portuguese (plural guaicurus). It was originally an offensive epithet given to the Mbayá people of Paraguay by the Guarani, meaning \"savage\" or \"barbarian\", which later was extended to the whole group. It has also been used in the past to include other peoples of the Chaco region, but is now restricted to those speaking a Guaicuruan language. First encountered by the Spanish in the 16th century, the Guaycuru peoples strongly resisted Spanish control and the efforts of Catholic missionaries to Christianize them. They were not fully pacified until the early 20th century.\n\n Paraguay is a landlocked country in South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. The vast majority of its population identifies as Roman Catholic, and religion in Paraguay plays a very important role. Paraguay is a socially conservative society; and has been slow to change traditional views on family: divorce was legalized only in 1991.\n\n Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is within the Andean mountain range. With 1098581 km2 of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in South America, after Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia (and alongside Paraguay, one of the only two landlocked countries in the Americas), the 27th largest in the world, the largest landlocked country in the Southern Hemisphere, and the world's seventh largest landlocked country, after Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Ethiopia. The country's population, estimated at 11 million, is multiethnic, including Amerindians, Mestizos, Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Spanish is the official and \n\n Paraguayan Guarani, is, alongside Spanish, one of the official languages of Paraguay. Paraguay's constitution is bilingual, and its state-produced textbooks are typically half in Spanish and half in Guarani. A variety of Guarani known as Chiripá is also spoken in Paraguay. It is closely related to Paraguayan Guarani, a language which speakers are increasingly switching to. There are 7,000 speakers of Chiripá in Paraguay. Additionally, another variety of Guarani known as Mbyá is also spoken in Paraguay by 8,000 speakers. Lexically, it is 75% similar to Paraguayan Guarani. The smallest Guarani speaking community in Paraguay is that of the Aché, also known as Guayaki, with a population of 850. Finally, in the Paraguayan Chaco Department, there are 304 speakers of Eastern Bolivian/Western Argentine Guarani, known locally as Ñandeva or Tapiete. (However, outside Paraguay, Ñandeva refers to Chiripá.) The largest Guarani group in the Chaco is that known locally as Guarayo who settled in Paraguay after the war with Bolivia (1932–35). They are originally from the Isoso area of Bolivia.\n\n In Paraguay, both modern-day Spanish and the Guaraní indigenous language are spoken, and both are official and taught in schools.

Other parts of the Code of Hammurabi show both debt and slavery as being part of the criminal justice system of the time, such as, \"If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it; if then the dam break \n\n The following is the 7th section of the Hammurabi law code, written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\n The earliest known use of impalement as a form of execution occurred in civilizations of the ancient Near East. The Code of Hammurabi, promulgated about 1772 BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man. In the late Isin/Larsa period, from about the same time, it seems that, in some city states, mere adultery on the wife's part (without murder of her husband mentioned) could be punished by impalement. From the royal archives of the city of Mari, most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi, it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled. Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of Elam made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates. For acts of perceived great sacrilege, some individuals, in diverse cultures, have been impaled for their effrontery. For example, roughly 1200 BC, merchants of Ugarit express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town Sidon, due to some \"great sin\" committed against the patron deity of Sidon.\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi, a set of laws dating back to ancient Mesopotamia, is often regarded as one of the earliest recorded codes of ethics in human history. Created by Babylonian King Hammurabi around 1754 BCE, the code consisted of 282 laws that covered various aspects of life, including commerce, trade, family, and criminal justice. While the code primarily focused on maintaining social order and protecting the rights of individuals, it also established principles for ethical conduct and the administration of justice. It provided guidelines for fair treatment, punishment for wrongdoing, and the resolution of disputes. The laws were inscribed on a stele and placed in public view, exemplifying the importance of transparency and accountability in societal governance. The Code of Hammurabi is widely recognized as a significant early contribution to the development of ethical principles and legal systems.\n\n In 1950/51 Malik Ram was posted in Iraq. His stay there aroused his interest in Babylonian civilisation and culture, in particular the laws of Hammurabi, the sixth Babylonian king. He was fascinated by the Code of Hammurabi and pursued the subject avidly, even after leaving Iraq. Between 1952 and 1955, he wrote a series of six detailed articles in Urdu on Hammurabi, his laws, Babylonian civilisation, traditions, customs and language. Five of these appeared in Tarikh o Siasiyat the Karachi history journal. The sixth was published in Urdu another Karachi journal. It was the first time in Urdu literature that anything in detail had been published on this subject. The six articles were subsequently revised, expanded and published as a book and in 2000, a new edition was published in Lahore entitled \"Hammurabi aur Babli Tahzib va Tamaddum\". Malik Ram maintained that Hammurabi is one of the all-time great figures in world history, who should be given more attention, time and space in the modern world, in educational institutions and by the media.\n\nQuestion: who is hammurabi and what did he do?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Educated at Clare College, Cambridge, he so distinguished himself in mathematics that when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected one of the council in 1716, and in 1723 Sir Isaac Newton, president of the society, appointed him one of the vice-presidents. On the death of Newton he became a candidate for the presidency, but was defeated by Sir Hans Sloane, whom, however, he succeeded in 1741; in 1742 he was made a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences; in 1746 he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge.

Ellys was a personal friend of Isaac Newton. He helped Newton with astronomical observations, and was one of the few who knew Newton at Cambridge who visited his rooms. Ellys was also noted as a leading tutor across the university, popular and distinguished; and was not ordained, but held the degree of M.D. A tutorial pupil, Henry Wharton, was taught by Newton, and is thought to have been the only undergraduate student to have seen Newton's mathematical papers. Another tutorial pupil was Samuel Clarke, and \n\n He was born in 1816, the second son of Newton Dickinson Hand Newton, vicar of Clungunford, Shropshire, and afterwards of Bredwardine, Herefordshire.

The university's flagship campus is in Chicago, Illinois, and its satellite campus is located in Vancouver, British Columbia. The university also offers online classes and degree programs online for both masters and doctoral students.\n\nHistory \nAdler University is named for Alfred Adler (1870–1937), a physician, psychotherapist, and founder of Adlerian psychology, which is sometimes called individual psychology. He is considered the first community psychologist, because his work pioneered attention to community life, prevention, and population health.\n\nAmong Adler's advocates and followers was Adler University founder Rudolf Dreikurs (1897–1972), a psychiatrist who immigrated to Chicago in 1937 after Adler's death. Dreikurs lived and worked in Chicago's Hull House, and he was instrumental in the child guidance movement in the U.S.\n\nIn 1952, Dreikurs founded the Institute of Adlerian Psychology that, in 1954, changed its name to the Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago, and in 1991 became known as the Adler School of Professional Psychology, and in 2015 as Adler University. Early instructors and founders of the institute were also Bernard Shulman, Harold Mosak, Bina Rosenberg, and Robert Powers.\n\nIn 1963, the institute was chartered as a not-for-profit Illinois corporation and approved as a post-secondary educational provider. A year later, the institute created a group therapy program for those incarcerated at Cook County Jail, a program that was a precursor to the school's later focus on the incarcerated and the formerly incarcerated. In 1972, the institute established its on-campus Dreikurs Psychological Services Center, a community mental health center and training site for students, which was the precursor to today's Adler Community Health Services (ACHS), directed by Dan Barnes. In 1973, the Illinois Office of Education granted the institute the authority to award the Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology. The institute received full accreditation of masters level programs and awarded its first M.A. degrees in 1978. It received doctoral level accreditation in 1987, and awarded its first Psy.D. degrees in 1990. The Psy.D. program was accredited by the American Psychological Association in 1998. (This accreditation has been maintained, but is limited to the Chicago campus.)\n\nAcademics \nMaster and doctoral programs are offered at both the Chicago and Vancouver campuses. In fall 2013, the Vancouver campus began offering a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology—the first traditional Psy.D. program in Canada.\n\nAdler University's Chicago campus is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the American Psychological Association.\n\nAll of Adler University's masters and doctoral programs offered at the Vancouver campus are offered under the written consent of the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education,  having undergone a quality assessment process and been found to meet the criteria established by the Ministry. Doctoral programs at the University's Vancouver campus are not currently accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association.\n\nCampuses \nIn addition to its main campus in downtown Chicago, Adler University also maintains a campus in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nCommunity partnerships \nAnnually, Adler University students provide over 650,000 hours of community service. Adler University partners with more than 700 agencies to advance community health. Adler Community Health Services (ACHS) provides psychological services to under-served populations through its clinical training programs.\n\nACHS training programs include the Adler Community Mental Health Doctoral Internship in Clinical Psychology as well as psychotherapy and diagnostic assessment externships, also known as clinical practica. The pre-doctoral internship at ACHS is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) and is a member of the Association of Psychology Post-doctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC).\n\nA distinctive feature of Adler's programs, the Community Service Practicum (CSP) is a requirement for all first-year students at the School. The CSP is unique non-clinical experience, meant to expose future practitioners to concepts of social justice and social change, and to instill in them the ethos and the skill set necessary to engage in socially responsible practice.\n\nSee also \n Classical Adlerian psychology\n North American Society of Adlerian Psychology\n Alfred Adler\n Rudolf Dreikurs\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\nEducational institutions established in 1952\nUniversities and colleges in Chicago\nAdlerian psychology\nPsychology institutes\nGraduate schools in the United States\nPsychology organizations based in the United States\nPrivate universities and colleges in Illinois\n1952 establishments in Illinois\n\nAdler University is a private not-for-profit university, with two campuses in North America.

He is considered the first community psychologist, because his work pioneered attention to community life, prevention, and population health.\n\nAmong Adler's advocates and followers was Adler University founder Rudolf Dreikurs (1897–1972), a psychiatrist who immigrated to Chicago in 1937 after Adler's death. Dreikurs lived and worked in Chicago's Hull House, and he was instrumental in the child guidance movement in the U.S.\n\nIn 1952, Dreikurs founded the Institute of Adlerian Psychology that, in 1954, changed its name to the Alfred Adler Institute of Chicago, and in 1991 became known as the Adler School of Professional Psychology, and in 2015 as Adler University. Early instructors and founders of the institute were also Bernard Shulman, Harold Mosak, Bina Rosenberg, and Robert Powers.\n\nIn 1963, the institute was chartered as a not-for-profit Illinois corporation and approved as a post-secondary educational provider. A year later, the institute created a group therapy program for those incarcerated at Cook County Jail, a program that was a precursor to the school's later focus on the incarcerated and the formerly incarcerated. In 1972, the institute established its on-campus Dreikurs Psychological Services Center, a community mental health center and training site for students, which was the precursor to today's Adler Community Health Services (ACHS), directed by Dan Barnes. In 1973, the Illinois Office of Education granted the institute the authority to award the Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology. The institute received full accreditation of masters level programs and awarded its first M.A. degrees in 1978. It received doctoral level accreditation in 1987, and awarded its first Psy.D. degrees in 1990. The Psy.D. program was accredited by the American Psychological Association in 1998. (This accreditation has been maintained, but is limited to the Chicago campus.)\n\nAcademics \nMaster and doctoral programs are offered at both the Chicago and Vancouver campuses.

Three days later, New York Newsday reported that Dean claimed the cancer was the size of \"a grain of sand\" when it was found during a routine X-ray, that the cancer was \"caught very much in time,\" that she was receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient and that Pleshette was \"in good spirits.\" She was later hospitalized for a pulmonary infection and developed pneumonia which caused her to remain in the hospital for an extended period of time.

She has also been diagnosed with Lyme disease and Sjögren syndrome. At one point she was confined to her bed 90% of the time. On July 20, 2019, while giving a headline speech, Soranno suddenly sat down on a chair.

In the early stages of her condition, she continued to present Radio 5 Live, saying she would rather be known as \"Rachael the news presenter\" than \"Rachael the cancer patient\". She was attacked by Internet trolls who accused her of \"not fighting cancer hard enough\". Following the diagnosis, Bland started presenting the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C to raise awareness of cancer, discussing the disease with celebrities and providing advice of how to manage it. The podcast featured fellow cancer patients Deborah James and Lauren Mahon and became popular for its discussion of cancer, with medical experts regularly appearing on the programme.

(Some researchers have suggested the share of DCIS that is destined to become invasive cancer is as low as 20 percent.) Doctors do not know precisely which cases of DCIS will progress to invasive cancer because nearly all women with DCIS opt to have it removed immediately, eliminating the ability of researchers to study what would happen if it were left alone. Despite the dramatic increase in DCIS diagnoses and treatment in recent decades, the rate of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer has not dropped, indicating that the two conditions may not be as closely linked as scientists once believed. The dearth of good numbers and the knowledge that thousands—and possibly tens of thousands—of women have unnecessary DCIS breast surgery every year has unnerved many in the oncology community. Some wonder if _pre-cancer_ is a more appropriate label than _stage 0_ cancer. Some have even suggested that the word _cancer_ itself might be a misnomer. Hearing the words _breast cancer_ can spark in even the most levelheaded woman an urgent desire to remove the threat and ensure it never returns.

The city was founded as Byzantion by Megarian colonists in 657 BCE. It was renamed by Constantine the Great first as \"New Rome\" (Nova Roma) during the official dedication of the city as the new Roman capital in 330 CE, which he soon afterwards changed to Constantinople (Constantinopolis). The city was officially renamed \n\n The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Byzantine Empire: Byzantine Empire (or Byzantium) &ndash; the Constantinople-centred Roman Empire of the Middle Ages. It is also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, primarily in the context of Late Antiquity, while the Roman Empire was still administered with separate eastern and western political centres. In its own time, there was no such thing as \"the Byzantine Empire,\" there was just the ongoing Roman Empire; \"Byzantine Empire\" is a scholarly term of convenience to differentiate the empire from its earlier existence during classical antiquity before the western half collapsed (see decline of the Roman Empire). Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire (, Basileia Rhōmaiōn; Imperium Romanum) or Romania (Ῥωμανία). After the Western Roman Empire fragmented and collapsed in the 5th century, the eastern half continued to thrive, existing for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During much of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.\n\n Constantinople ( Kōnstantinoupolis; Constantinopolis; ) was the capital of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin Empire (1204–1261) and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). The capital then moved to Ankara. Officially renamed as Istanbul in 1930, the city is today the largest city and financial centre of the Republic of Turkey (1923–present). In 324, the ancient city of Byzantium was renamed “New Rome” and declared the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was renamed, and dedicated on 11 May 330. Constantinople is generally considered to be the center and the \"cradle of Orthodox Christian civilization\". \n\n Eastern Mediterranean populations, which remained under Eastern Roman (or \"Byzantine\") control after the 5th century, retained \"Roman\" as their predominant identity;' the majority of the population saw themselves as being Roman beyond any doubt and their emperor as ruling from the cultural and religious center of the Roman Empire: Constantinople, the New Rome.' In the centuries when the Byzantine Empire was still a vast Mediterranean-spanning state, Roman identity was more strong in the imperial heartlands than on the peripheries, though it was also strongly embraced in the peripheral regions in times of uncertainty. As in earlier centuries, the Romans of the early Byzantine Empire were \n\n were restored by law. By 395, the year in which the Roman Empire was officially divided in half and the aptly named Theodosius the Great died, the east was so strong that it could now be considered an equal.  The Byzantine Empire was the predominantly Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), originally known as Byzantium. Initially the eastern half of the Roman Empire (often called the Eastern Roman Empire in this context), it survived the 5th century fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.\n\nQuestion: what was the capital city of the east roman empire?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He later co-founded Slipknot in September 1995, alongside Colsefni, Gray, second guitarist Josh \"Gnar\" Brainard, drummer Joey Jordison and percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan. He was described by Brainard as \"a pretty technical guitar player\" and \"one of those multi-talented guys\".

The vocalist playing a second percussion kit gave the band a layered, distinctive drum sound.

The Rejects split up as Jordison's \"other band\" Slipknot were signed to a major label. During the 1999 Ozzfest tour, Jordison met Tripp Eisen and asked him if he was interested in a project he had in mind; the reforming of the Rejects with Draztik. Eisen agreed to join the project and a friend of his from the band Dope and previously the Genitorturers, Racci Shay played drums with them.

The women's suffrage campaign is the most deeply embedded campaign of the past 250 years. At first, suffrage was treated as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this, with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the 1789 march on Versailles. In 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was founded, and originally included suffrage on its agenda before it was suppressed at the end of the year. As a gesture, this showed that issue was now part of the European \n\n At the outset of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the political or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce by the end of the century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views. In Scotland, Reid published her influential A Plea for Woman in 1843, which proposed a transatlantic Western agenda for women's rights, including voting rights for women. Caroline Norton advocated for changes in British law. She discovered a lack of legal rights for women upon entering an abusive marriage.

Sophia's mother was Bamba Müller, and her godmother was Queen Victoria. She had four sisters, including two half-sisters, and four brothers. She lived in Hampton Court in an apartment in Faraday House given to her by Queen Victoria as a grace and favour. During the early twentieth century, Singh was one of several Indian women who pioneered the cause of women's rights in Britain.

According to Loyola Press, she was a saint because of her charitable works, not her trances, demonstrated by her forgiveness towards a group of people who abused her during a trance, despite the excruciating pain they caused her. She ministered to the sick and the poor, moving into the hospital in Siena towards the end of her life, \"subjecting herself to great mortifications\".

Paintings from the last 15 years of his life are often considered a decline from the height of his career. His style was noticeably different in the years he spent in Padua (1509-1514), showing more landscapes, sunsets and warm colors incorporated with his signature architecture look. His style was more inconsistent, but often included fuller figures, deep shadows and less angular details. Examples of works Montagna's time in Padua featuring this style are the Exhumation of St. Anthony for the Scuola di San Antonio and the Virgin and Child with Four Saints in Saint Maria in Vanzo. In 1517 Montagna returned to Vicenza. In 1522 he was commissioned by the Scuola di San Giuseppe to paint an altarpiece for Cologna Veneta.

He was the first Augustinian to be canonized. At his canonization, Nicholas was credited with three hundred miracles, including three resurrections. The remains of St. Nicholas are preserved at the Shrine of Saint Nicholas in the Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino in the city of Tolentino, province of Macerata in Marche, Italy. He is particularly invoked as an advocate for the souls in Purgatory, especially during Lent and the month of November.

The episode was often depicted in The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit by the painter Stefano di Giovanni, who was known as \"Sassetta\". Of the two episodic depictions of the hermit Anthony's travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter with the demonic figure of a centaur along the pathway in a wood. Lucretius, in his first-century BC philosophical poem On the Nature of Things, denied the existence of centaurs based on their differing rate of growth.

On November 30, 2017, Hitchens recorded a season-high 15 combined tackles in Dallas' 34–15 victory over the Washington Redskins. Hitchens finished the season with 84 combined tackles (55 solo), two pass deflections, and one forced fumble in 12 games and 12 starts. Hitchens became an unrestricted free agent in 2018 and was considered one of the top free agent linebackers available. He was heavily linked to the Indianapolis Colts due to his experience under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus who was his linebacker coach with the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas Cowboys were interested in re-signing Hitchens, but were unable to offer a considerable contract.\n\n He received a considerable raise for the season after playing over 35% of the Dallas Cowboys' defensive snaps.

He made his credited film debut in the low-budget independent comedy-drama Living in Oblivion (1995), where he performed alongside Steve Buscemi. The film tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. Dinklage's role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism, who complains about his clichéd roles. The film has been well received by critics. The following year, he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama Bullet starring rapper Tupac Shakur. Even after his well-received performance in Living in Oblivion, Dinklage still could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy 13 Moons (2002).

RMB banknotes start at one Yuan and go up to 100 Yuan. It is also used as a synonym of that currency, especially in international contexts – the ISO 4217 standard code for renminbi is CNY, an abbreviation of \"Chinese yuan\". (A similar case is the use of the terms sterling to designate British currency and pound for the unit of account.) The symbol for the yuan (元) is also used in Chinese to refer to the currency units of Japan (yen) and Korea (won), and is used to translate the currency unit dollar as well as some other currencies; for example, the United States dollar is called Meiyuan in Chinese, and the euro is called Ouyuan. When used in English in the context of the modern foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan (CNY) refers to the renminbi (RMB), which is the official currency used in mainland China.\n\n has been to make the RMB fully convertible. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government. Following the internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF voted to designate the renminbi as one of several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The RMB became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the United States dollar, euro, British pound, and Japanese yen.\n\n The idea of fiat currency was established just over a thousand years ago in China during the Yuan, Tang, Song and Ming dynasties. In the Tang Dynasty (618-907) There was a high demand for metallic currency that exceeded the supply of precious metals. The people were already familiar with the use of credit notes, and they rapidly began accepting pieces of paper or paper drafts. A shortage of coins forced these people to change from coins to notes. During the Song Dynasty (960-1276), there was a booming business in the Sichan region that led to a shortage of copper money. This led to traders issuing private notes covered by a monetary reserve. This was considered to be the first ever legal tender. Paper money became the only legal tender in the Yuan Dynasty (1276-1367) and issuing of notes was conferred \n\n The renminbi (abbreviation: RMB; ; symbol: 元/¥; code: CNY) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China and one of the world's reserve currencies, ranking as the eighth most traded currency in the world as of April 2019. The yuan is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. One yuan divides into 10 jiao, and a jiao in turn divides into 10 fen. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China.\n\n In China, cash - not to be confused with the type of copper coin - refers to a unit used for centuries for copper coinage and banknote equivalents known as wén (文). Being the first country to implement paper based currency, in 1023 the 交子 paper money currency occur to adapt the economical climate change of globalization brought by fair trade via silk road, although metal coins were still in circulation. After the introduction of a unified currency system in 1889, cash continued to be used as a subunit of the yuan with 1000 cash being equal to one yuan. Coins continued to be denominated in cash until the 1920s nationally and for a time thereafter regionally.\n\nQuestion: what form of currency does china have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Their goal was to sail through the Strait of Magellan to get to their destiny, which scared many sailors because of the harsh weather conditions. The first major expedition around South America was organized by a voorcompagnie, the Magelhaen Company. It organized two fleets of five and four ships with 750 sailors and soldiers to \"devaluate the Spanish\". It resulted in utter disaster, 80% of the men died during the journey and the investors made no profit.

The expedition's cartographer and translator, Antonio Pigafetta, left this description of the place: \"On Tuesday, September 20, in the same year [1519] we departed from the place called Sanlúcar [de Barrameda], heading southwest, and before the end of the month, on the 26th, we arrived at an island that is called Tenerife, at 28 degrees longitude, to acquire meat, water, and firewood.

He joined the expedition to the Spice Islands led by explorer Ferdinand Magellan under the flag of the emperor Charles V and after Magellan's death in the Philippine Islands, the subsequent voyage around the world. During the expedition, he served as Magellan's assistant and kept an accurate journal, which later assisted him in translating the Cebuano language. It is the first recorded document concerning the language. Pigafetta was one of the 18 men who made the complete trip, returning to Spain in 1522, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, out of the approximately 240 who set out three years earlier. These men completed the first circumnavigation of the world. Others mutinied and returned in the first year.

At least one warship of the Italian Navy, a destroyer of the Navigatori class, was named after him in 1931.\n\n the Atlantic Ocean, to the eastern coast of South America, and down to Patagonia. Despite a series of storms and mutinies, the expedition successfully passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Mar del Sur, which Magellan renamed the \"Peaceful Sea\" (the modern Pacific Ocean). The expedition reached Guam and, shortly after, the Philippine islands. There Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521.

It is the last farm on the plateau. The site was four hectares and fifty people turned it into an organic farm, fighting the plan of Immochan to build a shopping centre. The local council protected the land and in August 2015, Immochan sold the site to a local real estate company which proposed an organic farming project.

In the 2nd-3rd centuries BCE, it was situated between the territories occupied by the Volcae Arecomici, the Averni, and the Gabali tribes. In 121 BCE the Romans gained control of much of southern France including the area around Le Vigan. The Volcae Arecomici voluntarily surrendered their territory, and the Arverni gave up much territory in a treaty that nevertheless preserve their independence. Under Roman control, Le Vigan was part of the Roman \"Provincia,\" (hence Provence) called Gallia Narbonensis.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first fights started on 1 October 1991, when the Yugoslav People's Army, controlled by Serbs, attacked the Croat-populated village of Ravno in Herzegovina. Alija Izetbegović considered that as part of the war in Croatia, and ignored it, saying that \"it is not our war\". On 3 March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence. In the following days, many countries, including Croatia, recognized the independence of BiH. The Bosnian War soon began and would last until November 1995. Serbs attacked Muslims in Bijeljina on 1 April 1992, \n\n disrupted the Croats' area and altered their pre-war ratio. Political disputes and minor incidents in central and northern Bosnia and in northern and central Herzegovina led to Croat-Bosniak War in November 1992. The Vance-Owen plan was presented in January 1993. It was planned to create 10 cantons on the territory of the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas around those towns \n\n In Serb-controlled areas, Serbs performed mass murders, ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs, primarily Bosniaks and Croats, established concentration camps and destroyed Bosniak and Croat cultural inheritance. By November 1992 Serbs had conquered 70% of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and held Sarajevo in limbo by terrorizing its population by shelling and constant sniper fire. The creation of a Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia was a matter of dispute for Bosniaks. Croats accused Bosniaks of Islamization of the country and attempts to create Bosniak domination in all areas. So they withdrew the ethnic Croat representatives from Parliament, Government and the Presidency. Due to expulsions by Bosnian Serbs, Bosniaks moved to other areas and \n\n The siege of Mostar was fought during the Bosnian War first in 1992 and then again later in 1993 to 1994. Initially lasting between April 1992 and June 1992, it involved the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) fighting against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. That phase ended in June 1992 after the success of Operation Jackal, launched by the Croatian Army (HV) and HVO. As a result of the first siege around 90,000 residents of Mostar fled and numerous religious buildings, cultural institutions, and bridges were damaged or destroyed. As the wider conflict matured and the political landscape changed, the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks began to fight against each other, culminating in the Croat–Bosniak War. Between June 1993 and April 1994 the HVO besieged Bosniak-concentrated East Mostar, resulting in the deaths of numerous civilians, a cut off of humanitarian aid, damage or destruction of ten mosques, and the blowing up of the historic Stari Most bridge. Hostilities ended with the signing of the Washington Agreement in March 1994 and the establishment of the Croat–Bosniak federation.\n\n Health in Bosnia and Herzegovina was impacted by the Balkan War of the early 1990s, during which Bosnia and Herzegovina declared their independence. Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war displaced over 800,000 refugees and killed over 100,000 people. The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic \"cleanse\" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. The war ended with NATO involvement and the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The Dayton Agreement acknowledges Bosnia and Herzegovina as a democratic country and the country is moving toward the basic principals that accompany that, such as civil \n\nQuestion: what happened in bosnia in the 90s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The American Football Conference (AFC) champions New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champions and defending Super Bowl XLVIII champions Seattle Seahawks, 28–24. The game was played on February 1, 2015, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the second held at the stadium and the third in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The Patriots' victory was their fourth overall and first since Super Bowl XXXIX, ending a 10-year championship drought. They finished the regular season with a 12–4 record en route to their eighth Super Bowl appearance, tying the record held by the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, and sixth under the leadership of \n\n during a 31-17 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Wildcard Game. On January 26, 2006, Hampton was selected to play in the 2006 Pro Bowl as a late replacement for New England Patriots' defensive end Richard Seymour, who was unable to participate due to an injury. The Pittsburgh Steelers reached Super Bowl XL after defeating the Indianapolis Colts 21–18 in the AFC Divisional Round and the Denver Broncos 34–17 in the AFC Championship Game. On February 5, 2006, Hampton recorded four solo tackles and sacked quarterback Matt Hasselbeck as the Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL.\n\n (W), XIII (W), XXX (L)) with Pittsburgh leading the series 2–1. In the 1970s, Pittsburgh and Dallas were both renowned for stifling defenses named \"The Steel Curtain\" and \"The Doomsday Defense\" respectively. Pittsburgh became the first team to achieve three Super Bowl wins when it defeated Dallas in Super Bowl XIII, and the first team to achieve four Super Bowl victories a year later when they defeated the Rams. Dallas defeated the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX to become the second team behind San Francisco to win five Super Bowl Championships. Ten years later, Pittsburgh would join Dallas and San Francisco to become the third team to reach that milestone when they \n\n Championship for the fifth time in eleven years. However, for the fourth time in that same span, the Steelers lost at home one game away from the Super Bowl, and, like in 2001, lost to the Patriots in a rematch from Week 8. The 2006 edition of Pro Football Prospectus listed the 2004 Steelers as one of their \"Heartbreak Seasons\", in which teams \"dominated the entire regular season only to falter in the playoffs, unable to close the deal.\" Said Pro Football Prospectus, \"In the playoffs, Roethlisberger hit an inconvenient slump, just like the Pittsburgh quarterbacks who came before him.

These theologians anchored Ubuntu in the Christian ideals of forgiveness and reconciliation as gifts from God critical for peaceful communal co-existence. Tutu, as chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa between 1996 and 1998, and operating from the premise of faith, theologizes the Ubuntu concept by anchoring it beyond community into God through the biblical category of the imago Dei. Tutu sees all realms of life in relation to God and all humanity as created in the image of God. It reasons that an understanding of the createdness of all humans in God's image would lead to affirming the dignity of one another.\n\nQuestion: where does archbishop desmond tutu live?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges. The indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent. Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics.\n\n native to the United States, as it is indigenous nowhere else except in the state of Hawaii. Spanish is the second most common language in the United States, and is one of the official languages, and the most widely spoken, in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. There are four major regional dialects in the United States: northeastern, south, inland north, and midwestern. The Midwestern accent (considered the \"standard accent\" in the United States, and analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English-speaking world) extends from what were once the \"Middle Colonies\" across the Midwest to the Pacific states.\n\n American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. Currently, American English is the most influential form of English worldwide. American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. Any American or Canadian accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called \"General\" or \"Standard\" American, a fairly uniform accent continuum native to certain regions of the U.S. and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single \"mainstream\" American accent. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century.\n\n The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. Nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish also reside in the US. There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others which were imported by immigrants. American Sign Language, used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the country. Hawaiian is also a \n\n English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is located on the south side of the Menkaure pyramid in the Giza Necropolis. It is the westernmost of the three pyramids of the queens. The American archaeologist George Andrew Reisner speculated that either this pyramid or G3-b may have been meant for Menkaure's half-sister, Shepsetkau, the daughter of Meresankh III and Khafre. The pyramid was built during the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, presumably for one of the wives of Menkaure. The surface of the pyramid is stepped, consisting of four platforms that decrease toward the top. The pyramid's base is 31.24 m square, and its height is 21.2 m.\n\n  Khafre's ka statue, which would have been located in the Valley temple of Khafre, was only one part of an extremely intricate system used in Egyptian funerary rituals. Located at the Pyramids of Gizeh, the necropolis included the Valley Temple of Khafre, a mortuary temple, the Great Sphinx, and a causeway leading to the pyramid of Khafre. The Great Pyramids of Gizeh (Pyramids of Giza), located on the outskirts of present-day Cairo, are three enormous pyramids for three Egyptian pharaohs with multiple smaller ones, housing the mummies of the royal family and nobles. From largest to smallest, the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure are the most famous and dedicated to each \n\n  The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Sources cite at least 118 identified Egyptian pyramids. Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others. The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built c. undefined during the Third Dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years.\n\n  The Giza Plateau is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \"Great Pyramid\" and the \"Pyramid of Cheops\"), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \"Queen's pyramids\", and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.\n\n The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Egyptologists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years.

This region was mostly untouched by European and American settlers until after the American Civil War, and excepting Missouri and the heavily forested states near the Great Lakes, was mainly populated by nomadic tribes like the Sioux, Osage, Arapaho, and Cheyenne. As with most other American Indians tribes, these tribes consumed the Three Sisters of beans, maize, and squash, but also for thousands of years followed the \n\n St. Paul dominate the landscape in wealth and size, owing to their ties with manufacturing, finance, transportation, and meatpacking. Smaller places like Omaha, Tulsa, and Kansas City are the local capitals, but the king is Chicago, third-largest city in the country, on the shores of Lake Michigan. Non-American Indian settlement began in Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan earlier than anywhere else in the region, and thus the food available here ranges from the sublime to the bizarre. As with all of the Midwest, the primary meats here are beef and poultry, since the Midwest has been raising turkeys, chickens, and \n\nRegion 1: Northeast ; Division 1: New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) ; Division 2: Mid-Atlantic (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) ; Region 2: Midwest (Prior to June 1984, the Midwest Region was designated as the North Central Region.) ; Division 3: East North Central (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin) ; Division 4: West North Central (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) ; Region 3: South ; Division 5: South Atlantic (Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington D.C., and West Virginia) ; Division 6: East South Central (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee) ; Division 7: West South Central (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas) ; Region 4: West ; Division 8: Mountain (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) ; Division 9: Pacific (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington) The United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 54,371, making it the eighth largest city in the state. The city was developed in response to talk of an air field being located nearby and named for the Tinker Air Force Base's original designation as the Midwest Air Depot. The city suffered damage during two tornadoes, the first in May 1999 and the second on May 8, 2003.\n\n  The heartland, when referring to a cultural region of the United States, is the central land area of the U.S., usually the Midwestern United States or the states that do not border the Atlantic or Pacific oceans, associated with mainstream or traditional values, such as economic self-sufficiency, conservative political and religious ideals, and rootedness in agrarian life. The US Census Bureau defines the Midwest as consisting of 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Portions of other non-coastal states can be included in the region as well.

The facility also hosted Spring Training for the Detroit Tigers from 1916 to 1918, the Cincinnati Reds in 1919, and the Chicago White Sox in 1921. (Prior to Florida and Arizona becoming established as the primary locations for spring training, major league teams used various sites from Indiana to Texas. One of the sites they chose was this field, adjacent to the city cemetery, which had been used for the Class D team for a few seasons. It is currently home to the Waxahachie High School baseball team.\n\n longtime Florida homes for new stadiums in the Cactus League in Arizona. The oldest of them all, Progress Energy Park, home of Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, was retired on March 28 with the Tampa Bay Rays losing to the Cincinnati Reds 6–3. The Rays, unlike the other teams to close stadiums before them, are staying in Florida; they are relocating their spring training home to the Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, where they spent $20 million to rebuild its main stadium. The site of Progress Energy Park was connected to plans to build a new retractable roof stadium for the Rays to replace the fixed-dome Tropicana Field, but was eventually withdrawn from consideration by team ownership in favor of a more thorough study.\n\n Al Lang Stadium was originally built as a spring training and minor league venue and served that purpose from 1947 until 2008. Spring training tenants included the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants, New York Mets, and Baltimore Orioles. Minor league tenants included the St. Petersburg Saints of the Florida International League and the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League. Al Lang Stadium's final minor league tenant was the Class A St. Petersburg Devil Rays, who last played at the stadium in 2000. In 1998, the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using the stadium for spring training. Their regular season home at Tropicana Field is approximately one mile west, making the Devil Rays the first major league team to train and play regular season games in the same city in almost 90 years. In 2006, the Rays, seeking to expand their fan base across the Tampa Bay area, decided to move their spring training operations to Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, about 80 miles south of St. Petersburg. They played their last spring training ballgame at Al Lang Stadium on March 28, 2008.\n\n The Expos held spring training at West Palm Beach Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach, Florida – a facility they shared with the Atlanta Braves – for the last time in 1997. It was their 21st season at the stadium; they had conducted spring training there from 1969 to 1972 and since 1981. In the final spring training game at Municipal Stadium, held on March 26, 1997, the Expos defeated the Braves 2-0. The following season, the Expos moved their spring training activities to Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida.\n\n spring training stadium are the triangle, Pesky's Pole, and Lone Red Seat marking the longest home run ever hit in the Fenway's history. One of the signature features of the ballpark is the wavy roof sitting over the seats in the stadium, providing shade for the fans in attendance. The roof also is an example of how the ballpark incorporated its location in Florida into the design of the stadium. The wavy design of the roof resembles the Cypress trees in the surrounding area of the ballpark. In addition, the blocks which make up the ballpark are embedded with sea shells from nearby Sanibel Island. The park also features a lawn in right field, a popular feature in spring training parks.

By the 1820s, the native-born colonists' speech was recognisably distinct from speakers in Britain and Ireland. Australian English differs from other varieties in its phonology, pronunciation, lexicon, idiom, grammar and spelling. Australian English is relatively consistent across the continent, however it encompasses numerous regional and sociocultural varieties. 'General Australian' describes the de-facto standard dialect, which is perceived to be free of pronounced regional or sociocultural markers and that is often used in the media.\n\n Relative to many other national dialect groupings, Australian English is relatively homogenous across the country. Some relatively minor regional differences in pronunciation exist. A limited range of word choices is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals may be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions. In addition, some Australians speak creole languages derived from Australian English, such as Australian Kriol, Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk. Academic research has also identified notable sociocultural variation within Australian English, which is mostly evident in phonology.\n\nAustralia – English is the de facto official language of Australia. Auslan is recognised by the Australian Government and is spoken by many Australian deaf people. Australian Aboriginal languages, of which there are approximately 290–363, have recognition – though only a few are popularly spoken by Australian Indigenous people, including: Wiradjuri, Pitjantjatjara, Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Ngaanyatjarra, Warlpiri and Australian Kriol. Many government departments and agencies, as well as private services, have adopted the use of Mandarin Chinese as a de facto second language, reflecting Australia's large Chinese population and strong trade and diplomatic ties to China. ; Fiji — Fijian, English and Hindi (Fiji dialect) \n\n Although Australia has no official language, English has always been entrenched as the de facto national language. Standard Australian English serves as the standard dialect. According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for 72.6% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (2.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.2%), Vietnamese (1.2%), Italian (1.2%), Greek (1.0%), Tagalog (0.8%), Hindi (0.7%), Spanish (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.6%); a considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. A 2010–2011 study by the Australia Early Development Index found the most common language spoken by children after English was Arabic, followed by Vietnamese, Greek, Chinese, and Hindi. 0.3% of Australians spoke an Indigenous Australian language at home in 2016.\n\n Australian English (AusE, AusEng, AuE, AuEng, en-AU) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Australia. Australian English is the country's common language and de facto national language. While Australia has no official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, being the only language spoken in the home for about 72.7% of Australians. It is also the main language used in compulsory education, as well as federal, state and territorial legislatures and courts. Australian English began to diverge from British and Irish English after the First Fleet established the Colony of New South Wales in \n\nQuestion: what language does australians speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Women were also a large part of Wild West shows and attracted many spectators. One such performer was Annie Oakley who first gained recognition as a sharpshooter when she defeated Frank Butler, a pro marksman at age 15, in a shooting exhibition. She became an attraction of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show for 16 years. Annie was billed in the show as \"Miss Annie Oakley, the Peerless Lady Wing-Shot\". Calamity Jane was another distinguished woman performer. Calamity Jane was a notorious frontierswoman who was the subject of many wild stories—many of which she made up herself. In the show, she was a skilled horsewoman and expert rifle and revolver handler. Calamity Jane appeared in Wild West shows \n\n After Harry Skepper had left Mamie and Reine on their own, Charles Francis Hafley and his wife, Lillian Smith (who had both performed in the Pan-American Exposition, with Cummins' Indian Congress, with Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill), asked Mamie Francis to join their venture called \"California Frank's Wild West\" in 1905. Lillian, a former competitor of Annie Oakley, and C.F. Hafley, a former sheriff, were renowned sharpshooters. They apparently thought this teenage mother, with her shooting and riding skills, would be a nice addition to their group who came from Pawnee Bill's and other Wild West shows. Lillian and Mamie started a comedy sharpshooting routine \n\n been described by historians as a high-spirited young woman who resembled Catherine Linton in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. She married Thompson in 1870 in Portland, Maine. Their first child, a son, was stillborn on September 3, 1871. They had eight more children:  In 1882, when John Thompson was concerned about losing an electoral battle in Antigonish, Annie wrote him to say that \"I wish I could be with you for one ten minutes to talk square to you...So keep up your courage... win or lose they can't keep you from me much longer...So now you must not be such an awful baby until you \n\n Annie and Frank Butler lived in Cincinnati for a time. Oakley, the stage name she adopted when she and Frank began performing together, is believed to have been taken from the city's neighborhood of Oakley, where they resided. Some people believe she took on the name because that was the name of the man who had paid her train fare when she was a child.  They joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1885. At five feet tall, Oakley was given the nickname of \"Watanya Cicilla\" by fellow performer Sitting Bull, rendered \"Little Sure Shot\" in the public advertisements. During her first engagement with the Buffalo \n\n Annie Oakley (born Phoebe Ann Moses; August 13, 1860 – November 3, 1926) was an American sharpshooter who starred in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Oakley developed hunting skills as a child to provide for her impoverished family in western Ohio. At 15, she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman Frank E. Butler, whom she later married. The pair joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting out a cigar from her husband's lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself. After a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defense. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Thomas Edison's earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894. Since her death, her story has been adapted for stage musicals and films, including Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nQuestion: who did annie oakley married?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to Hill, \"they had offered it to a couple of actors and they didn't want to do it.\" Then it was sent to Charles Bronson even though Hill thought he was \"too old\". A day later, Bronson's agent called back and said Bronson had read the script and wanted to do the film \"but he had to meet me. He wanted to see if I measured up.\" Hill remembers that Bronson \"was in remarkable physical condition for a guy his age; I think he was about 52 at the time. He had excellent coordination, and a splendid build. His one problem was that he was a smoker, so he didn't have a lot of stamina. I mean, he probably could have kicked anybody's ass on that movie, but he couldn't fight much longer than 30 or 40 seconds.\" Hill later said Bronson received \"very close to a million\" dollars for his role.\n\n Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee, (27 May 1922 – 7 June 2015) was an English actor, author, and singer. With a career spanning nearly seven decades, Lee was well known for portraying villains, gaining recognition for appearing as Count Dracula in seven Hammer Horror films—ultimately playing the role nine times in total. His other film roles include Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Count Dooku in the Star Wars films Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005), and Saruman in both the Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003) and the Hobbit film trilogy (2012–2014). Lee was knighted for services to drama and charity in \n\n a kid I'd tell the girls around the street the story about Dracula and I'd go 'th-th-th' (the sucking noise which he reproduced in The Silence of the Lambs). As a result, they'd run away screaming.\" He recalled going through the script of Silence of the Lambs for the first time with fellow cast members. \"I didn't know what they were going to make of it but I'd prepared it—my first line to Jodie Foster was: 'Good morning. You're one of Jack Crawford's aren't you?' Everyone froze. There was a silence. Then one of the producers said, 'Holy crap, don't change a thing'.\" On Hopkins's approach to playing villains, Miranda Sawyer in The Guardian writes, \"When he portrays \n\n Sally Kirkland and Diane Ladd in the short-lived off-Broadway play One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger, written by Shelley Winters. He often played a villain in features, including Scarecrow, which marked his film debut, The Seven-Ups, Bad Dreams, The Sword and the Sorcerer, and Little Nikita. In 1982, Lynch won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the evil King Cromwell in The Sword and the Sorcerer. Although Richard Lynch is best known for playing villains, he was cast as the president of the United States in the 2007 film Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy. Lynch starred alongside Judson Scott in the 1982 short-lived science fiction TV series The Phoenix. In addition to acting, Lynch was a musician, and he played \n\n my life.\" Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by Thomas Harris. The author was reportedly pleased with Hopkins's portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that Red Dragon would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, Hannibal Rising. Hopkins played Professor Van Helsing in Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). In 1992, Hopkins starred in Merchant-Ivory's period film based on the E. M. Forster novel Howards End. Hopkins acted alongside Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter where he played the cold businessman Henry Wilcox.

The route was later found not to be navigable because about 40 mi east of the Caprivi Strip is Victoria Falls, one of the world's largest waterfalls. Within Namibia, the Strip is divided administratively between Kavango East and Zambezi regions. It is crossed by the Okavango River. The Cuando River forms part of its border with Botswana, and the Zambezi River forms a part of its border with Zambia. The width of the strip varies from about 32 km to 105 km. Its largest settlement is Katima Mulilo, located at the point where the Zambezi reaches the Strip.\n\n The Zambezi Region (German and Afrikaans: Sambesi), until 2013 known as the Caprivi Region, is one of the 14 regions of Namibia, located in the extreme north-east of the country. It is largely concurrent with the Caprivi Strip and takes its name from the Zambezi River that runs along its border. Katima Mulilo is its capital and the largest city, the Governor is Lawrence Sampofu. The self-governed village Bukalo belongs to this region. The Zambezi Region had a population of 90,596 in 2011.

The television cameras found Jets coach Rex Ryan on the sideline exclaiming, \"Un-fucking-believable!\" Some Jets fans left and others voiced their displeasure with the way the team had played so far. Many turned their ire on Sanchez and began chanting for Ryan to insert backup Tim Tebow into the game. However, the Jets did not disclose until after the game that Tebow had been nursing an injury and, despite listing him as active, would not play him in the game.\n\n Hoping to increase their winning streak the Jets flew to INVESCO Field at Mile High for an AFC duel with the Broncos. In the 2nd quarter the Jets took the lead as QB Mark Sanchez made a 32-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. But Denver replied with QB Tim Tebow scrambling 5 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. This was followed by kicker Matt Prater nailing a 59-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Jets responded with kicker Nick Folk hitting a 56-yard field goal. The Jets fell behind when QB Kyle Orton made a 17-yard TD pass to WR Demaryius Thomas. But replied in the fourth quarter with RB LaDainian Tomlinson making a 20-yard TD run.

In sum, it guaranteed Cespedes $137.6 million over five years with the Mets. In December 2013, Van Wagenen negotiated a $240 million, 10-year contract for Robinson Canó with the Seattle Mariners. The deal made Cano just the fifth player to sign a contract for $200 million or more with only Alex Rodriguez ever signing a contract worth more in guaranteed salary. Cano's contract more than doubled the previous record guarantee for a second baseman, was the largest contract ever for a player who had not had a 35-homer season and was just the fifth 10-year contract of the past decade.

The Lagoon is protected from the ocean by long sand spits that run east and west for up to 100 km in both directions. Lagos has a tropical savanna climate with two rainy seasons. The heaviest rains fall from April to July and there is a weaker rainy season in October and November. Total annual rainfall is 1900 mm. Average temperatures range from 25 °C (77 °F) in July to 29 °C (84 °F) in March. For many years the staple products of the region were palm oil and palm kernels. Manufacture of palm oil was mainly considered a job for women. Later exports included copra made from the coconut palm, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood and sesame (benne).\n\n Situated almost at the geographical centre of Nigeria and about 179 km from Abuja, the nation's capital, Jos is linked by road, rail and air to the rest of the country. The city is served by Yakubu Gowon Airport, but its rail connections no longer operate as the only currently operational section of Nigeria's rail network is the western line from Lagos to Kano. At an altitude of 1,217 m above sea level, Jos' climate is closer to temperate than that of the vast majority of Nigeria. Average monthly temperatures range from 21 - 25 °C, and from mid-November to late January, night-time temperatures drop as low as 7 C. Hail sometimes falls during the rainy season because of the cooler temperatures at high altitudes. These cooler temperatures have, from colonial times until the present day, made Jos a favourite holiday location for both tourists and expatriates based in Nigeria. Jos receives about 1400 mm of rainfall annually, the precipitation arising from both convectional and orographic sources, owing to the location of the city on the Jos Plateau. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Jos has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated Aw.\n\n In contrast to the rather steamy and humid climate of most other parts of southeastern Nigeria, the climate in this part of the country (owing to its altitude) is relatively cool; most days in the dry season the temperature will reach 20-23 C and drop to 16-18 C at night, whilst in the wet season these averages fall a couple of degrees.\n\n1 February – A ban on commercial motorcycles goes into effect in Lagos State. ; 4 February ; US $300 million (£230 million) seized from former president Sani Abacha's laundered accounts will be returned to Nigeria. ; Senate approves budget for customs. ; 7 February – American rapper Lil Wayne says, \"I'm more Nigerian than American.\" ; 9 February – At least 30 people killed in Auno, Borno State, apparently by Boko Haram. ; 14 February – International flights to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos are diverted to Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ghana, due to poor weather and complications with new equipment. ; 27 February – A stolen bronze statue from Ifẹ in the Yoruba kingdom is ceased at the Mexico City International Airport and returned to Nigeria.

Under the Canadian Constitution, laws related to timekeeping are a provincial and territorial matter. Most of Saskatchewan, despite geographically being in the Mountain Time Zone, observes year-round Central Standard Time (CST). In 2020, the Yukon Territory abandoned seasonal time change to permanently observe year-round Mountain Standard Time (MST). In the regions of Canada where daylight saving time is used, it begins on the second Sunday of March at 2 a.m. and ends on the first Sunday in November at 2 a.m. As a result, daylight saving time lasts in Canada for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, or about 65 percent of the entire year.\n\n and then re-enters the Central Time Zone south of  Gary.  And in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan it crosses the Central/Eastern time zone boundary one more time, ending at Lake Superior in the Eastern Time Zone. ; In Indiana, I-64 crosses the Central/Eastern time zone boundary 5 times between mileposts 60 and 80. ; I-65 begins in the Central Time Zone in Mobile, Alabama, crosses into the Eastern Time Zone in Kentucky, and 260 mi later re-enters the Central Time Zone in northwestern Indiana. ; A straight section of Texas State Highway 115 travels through four counties (Andrews, Martin, Gaines, and Dawson) in a distance of less than 1 mi. \n\ndivides the southwest portion of North Dakota from the rest of the state ; divides South Dakota roughly in half ; divides the western third of Nebraska from the rest of the state ; divides a very small portion of extreme western Kansas bordering Colorado (Greeley, Hamilton, Sherman, and Wallace counties) from the rest of the state (three other counties which border Colorado—Cheyenne, Morton, and Stanton counties—observe central time) ; follows the border between New Mexico (west) and Oklahoma (east) (although the zone legally begins at the Oklahoma–New Mexico state line, Kenton in extreme northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma unofficially observes mountain time) ; follows the border between New Mexico (west) and Texas (east) ; divides El Paso County, Hudspeth County, and a portion of northwestern Culberson County that includes eastern Guadalupe Mountains National Park from the rest of Texas \n\n in its Alberta portion, in particular along the Yellowhead Highway west of Meridian Avenue and along the Alberta side of 50th Avenue south of the Yellowhead Highway. Lloydminster's distinctive situation is reflected in other legal matters, including its time zone. Most of Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time, instead staying on Central Standard Time year-round. However, Alberta mandates daylight saving time. Lloydminster's charter allows the city to follow Alberta's use of daylight saving time on both sides of the provincial border in order to keep all clocks within the city in synchronisation. This has the effect of placing Lloydminster and the surrounding area in the Mountain Time Zone along with Alberta. During the summer, the entire city is on GMT−06:00—Mountain Daylight Time while the rest of Saskatchewan \n\n Although all of Saskatchewan is geographically within the Mountain Time Zone, the province officially observes Central Time year-round. This means that clocks in most of the province match clocks in Winnipeg during the winter and Calgary and Edmonton during the summer. The Saskatchewan Time Act of 1966 designated the use of CST year-round for eastern Saskatchewan and gave local options for western parts of the province. Since 1972, all western regions of the province (except around Lloydminster) have opted to use CST year-round. The city of Lloydminster, which is bisected by the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary, and its immediate surrounding region, observe Mountain Time year-round, with officially sanctioned daylight saving time (which in the summer puts it in synchronization with the rest of Saskatchewan). This is to keep clocks on the Saskatchewan side in synchronization with those on the Alberta side; Alberta mandates the use of daylight saving time province-wide. Along the Manitoba border, the small, remote Saskatchewan towns of Denare Beach and Creighton unofficially observe Central Daylight Time during the summer, thereby keeping the same time as larger neighbouring Manitoba communities.\n\nQuestion: where is the time zone line in south dakota?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is known for his hit song \"Nintendo\" from the \"Future Throwback\" album, released in 2016. The \"Nintendo\" music video proceeded the album's release and garnered over one million views on YouTube. He then followed with the full-length album \"Future Throwback\" in 2016, which debuted in the Apple Top 20. Born and raised near Chicago, Illinois, he later relocated to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California for a degree in music. After graduation, Carey launched his music career as a solo artist, eventually moving to back to Chicago. He focused on his solo career in Chicago, then later in New York City where he currently resides. He has since released three solo albums and two EPs. His 2010 EP, After The Morning After debuted in the iTunes Top 40 Pop Charts. He has toured nationally and performed on stage with such artists as Fall Out Boy, The 1975, Echosmith, Jason Mraz, John Mayer. His music has been featured in various television shows and movies, such as MTV's The Real World and the movies Palo Alto and True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet.\n\n After his activist outings during 2010-2011, Mraz felt inspired to write an album and told that it was based around the theme of love. However, he realized that the fundamentals of making \"an album about love\" took some time and hard work. \"I thought it would be pretty easy as a songwriter to always write through a filter of love,\" Mraz told Jam! Canoe. \"But the challenges at first were trying to write songs about love from the heart that weren't cheesy. What I learned quickly was that when a song was cheesy, it usually just came from the mind. It usually came from the craft of songwriting which anyone can do. So what I needed was experience, things that were going to rip my heart open to show me what I'm made of.\" \"The Woman I Love\" was released as the third single from \"Love Is a Four Letter Word\" on February 4, 2013, on iTunes. The single includes the \"Original Version\" of the song and its music video.\n\n Stephen Thomas Azar (born April 11, 1964) is an American country music singer, songwriter, guitarist, and philanthropist. Active since 1996, he has released a total of seven studio albums: one on the former River North Records, one on Mercury Nashville, and five independently. Azar has charted nine times on Billboard Hot Country Songs, most successfully with his late 2001-early 2002 hit \"I Don't Have to Be Me ('til Monday)\", which reached the number two position there. After leaving Mercury in 2005, Azar began recording independently; Slide On Over Here, his second independently-released album, charted the top-40 country singles \"Moo La Moo\" and \"Sunshine (Everybody Needs a Little)\" in 2009. In addition to these albums, Azar released \n\n Waiting for My Rocket to Come is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz, released on October 15, 2002, by Elektra Records. It was his only studio release on that label before he moved to Atlantic Records. By December 2003, the album had sold 500,000 copies, prompting Entertainment Weekly to dub Mraz \"The winner of 2003’s sensitive singer-songwriter sweepstakes\". The album's commercial success occurred partly because of its successful Top 40 single \"The Remedy (I Won't Worry)\", as well as Mraz's energetic live performances and extensive self-promotion. Mraz said the title was an optimistic title, reflecting the process of playing music while simultaneously preparing for success while waiting for success to arrive.\n\n Jason Thomas Mraz (born June 23, 1977) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. In 2002 he released his debut studio album, Waiting for My Rocket to Come, which contained the single \"The Remedy (I Won't Worry)\" that reached number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, his first top-40 hit in the US. His second album, Mr. A-Z, released in 2005, peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 100,000 copies in the US. In 2008 Mraz released his third studio album, We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and was an international commercial success primarily due to the hit \"I'm Yours\". The song peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving him his first top ten single, spent a then-record 76 \n\nQuestion: where is jason mraz from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances. While he came across to Lewis at the time as \"delighted\" about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch. He reportedly told Plant, \"I've had it with playing drums. Everybody \n\n Marital problems, diabetes, cocaine addiction and the death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham all took their toll on Grant's health, and after the official breakup of Led Zeppelin in 1980, and the subsequent folding of the Swan Song label in 1983, he virtually retired from the music business to his private estate in Hellingly, East Sussex. However, towards the end of his life he conquered his addiction and lost a significant amount of weight. His first public appearance for many years was in 1989, when he and Jimmy Page both attended a Frank Sinatra concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Grant subsequently sold his estate and moved to nearby Eastbourne, where he was offered the civic position of local magistrate for the town council, but turned it down. In 1992, he appeared in the film Carry On Columbus as a cardinal. In his remaining years, Grant became a keynote speaker at music management conferences such as In the City, where he was lauded by latter-day peers.\n\n Led Zeppelin performed for the first time since the death of their drummer John Bonham in 1980. Two drummers filled in for Bonham: Phil Collins, who had played on singer Robert Plant's first two solo albums, and Tony Thompson. The performance was criticised for Plant's hoarse voice, Jimmy Page's obvious intoxication and out-of-tune guitar, a lack of rehearsal, and poorly functioning monitors. Plant described the performance as \"a fucking atrocity for us. ... It made us look like loonies.\" Page later criticised Collins' performance, saying: \"Robert told me Phil Collins wanted to play with us. I told him that was all right if he knows the numbers. But at the end of the day, he didn't know anything. We played 'Whole Lotta Love', and he was just there bashing away cluelessly and grinning. I thought that was really a joke.\" Collins responded: \"It wasn't \n\n better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing.\" After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal. Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's Chicago Tribune containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.\n\n Bonham has been public about his diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (TS) and the impact it has had on his career. On May 12, 2015, Bonham was aboard Amtrak train 188, which derailed in Philadelphia resulting in the death of eight passengers. In an interview with CNN, Bonham told Anderson Cooper that he was \"fortunate to be able to walk away from the Amtrak train derailment alive.\"\n\nQuestion: what killed john bonham?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to Fool.com, \"In the three full fiscal years since the Jet acquisition Walmart's eCommerce sales have nearly tripled, jumping 176%. The company has rapidly expanded grocery pickup and delivery and now has about 3,300 stores with grocery pickup and more than 1,850 stores offering grocery delivery, up from just a handful at the time of the Jet acquisition. Under the guidance of Lore, the company rolled out free two-day delivery for orders over $35 without a membership fee to compete with Amazon Prime, and that was accelerated to free one-day delivery last year, shortly after Amazon made the same move in Prime. In the most recent quarter, Walmart expanded ship-from-store capabilities to 2,500 stores, \n\n  Grocery stores in South America have been growing fast since the early 1980s. A large percentage of food sales and other articles take place in grocery stores today. Some examples are the Chilean chains Cencosud (Jumbo and Santa Isabel covering Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru), Walmart (Lider and Ekono) as well as Falabella (Tottus in Chile and Peru and Supermercados San Francisco in Chile). These three chains are subsidiaries of large retail companies which also have other kinds of business units, such as department stores and home improvement outlets. All three also operate their own credit cards, which are a key driver for sales, and they also sell insurance and operate travel agencies. These companies also run some malls in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia. Two other chains started in 2008: Unimarc, which bought several small local chains and has over 20% of the grocery segment in Chile; and Southern Cross, a Chilean Investment Fund that has around 8.6% of the supermarket segment, mainly oriented to the southern areas of the country. In Puerto Rico, popular grocery stores include Pueblo Supermarkets and Amigo.\n\n Trust-Mart is a Taiwanese-owned chain of Chinese retail supercenters. The corporation was founded in 1997 by investors based in Taiwan and as of March, 2006, had in excess of 100 stores in 20 provinces of Mainland China. In October 2006, it was announced that Wal-Mart had won a bid to acquire 100 Chinese Trust-Mart centers for roughly one billion USD. By February 2007 Walmart had completed the purchase of 35% of Bounteous Co Ltd, the operator of Trust-Mart.\n\n The company lost market share in its housewares and electronics sectors to giant discounters such as Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond, and later Best Buy and Circuit City. Although Service Merchandise was early to embrace the Internet in the 1990s, generating tens of millions of dollars in sales, it was not enough to offset the damage done by the mega-chain stores springing up nationwide. Until its closure, however, Service Merchandise enjoyed a strong jewelry department, continuing as the largest watch retailer in the United States. Gary M. Witkin was appointed to the new position of president and chief operating officer in 1994. The company responded to the market pressures with a series of restructuring plans that included the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines such as electronics, toys and sporting goods, and refocusing on jewelry, gifts, and home decor products. Many of their showrooms were also closed or downsized significantly. During this time, the company was successful in sub-dividing a number of its company-owned stores into two or three units and sub-leasing the newly created spaces to other national chains, thus reducing costs and generating more store traffic.\n\n the power of its store base, and it launched Express Delivery, promising delivery in two hours.\" In 2017, Walmart and Lore announced the launch of Store No. 8, a technology incubator based in the Silicon Valley. The initiative was named after an early Walmart store that founder, Sam Walton, used to try out new retail strategies. At the 2017 Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas, Lore said Store No. 8 will work with startups that specialize in areas that include robotics, virtual reality and augmented reality, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. During his time at Walmart he accelerated the company's e-commerce growth and customer reach – making it the No. 2 online shopping site in the U.S., helping to increase the stock price of more than 100 percent during his tenure.\n\nQuestion: what industry does walmart operate in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Mavericks would on go to be NBA Champions that year, a franchise first and their second time making the finals. After 6 years, this season marked the end of the Chris Paul era as he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers during the lockout after the season. Believed by many as the greatest Hornet/Pelican of all time, Paul was originally going to be traded to the Lakers in a 3-team deal that would send Lamar Odom, Goran Dragic, Luis Scola, Kevin Martin, and a 2012 first round draft pick to the Hornets and Pau Gasol to the Houston Rockets, but NBA Commissioner David Stern had controversially vetoed the trade.\n\nQuestion: what team was chris paul on?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After the fall of socialism in Czechoslovakia, the word \"socialist\" was dropped in the names of the two republics, i.e. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic (still part of Czechoslovakia, since April 1990 of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic). The complicated system of parliamentary voting (there were de facto 5 different bodies each having right of veto) was kept after the fall of socialism, complicating and delaying political decisions during radical changes in the economy. In November 1992, the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992. As of 1 January 1993, the Slovak Republic became an independent state and officially took the name Slovakia as a short form – see dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\n Since 1960, Czechoslovakia's official name had been the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (Československá socialistická republika, ČSSR). In the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution, newly elected President Václav Havel announced that \"Socialist\" would be dropped from the country's official name. Conventional wisdom suggested that the country would resume the name used from 1919 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1960, Czechoslovak Republic (Československá republika). However, Slovak politicians objected that the traditional name subsumed Slovakia's equal status in the federal state too much. The first compromise was Constitutional Law 81/1990, which changed the country's name to Czechoslovak Federative Republic (, Česko-slovenská federatívna republika; ČSFR), explicitly acknowledging the federal nature of the \n\n The Slovak Socialist Republic (Slovenská socialistická republika, SSR) was from 1969 to 1990 a republic within the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, when previously unitary Czechoslovak state changed into a federation. The name was used from 1 January 1969 until March 1990. The Slovak Republic (Slovenská republika, SR) was from 1990 to 1992 a republic within the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, that is now the independent Slovakia.\n\n The Slovak Soviet Republic (Slovak: Slovenská republika rád, Hungarian: Szlovák Tanácsköztársaság, Ukrainian: Словацька Радянська Республіка, literally: \"Slovak Republic of Councils\") was a short-lived Communist state in southeast Slovakia in existence from 16 June 1919 to 7 July 1919. Its capital city was Prešov and was established and headed by Czech journalist Antonín Janoušek. It was the fourth communist state created in history. In 1918, Czechoslovak troops began occupying northern Hungary in accordance with the territorial promises that the Triple Entente made to Czechoslovak politicians during World War I. However, Upper Hungary (today mostly Slovakia) was occupied by Hungarian troops from the Hungarian Soviet Republic, who helped create the Slovak Soviet Republic. Following a brief war among Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania, the Slovak Soviet Republic fell and later the territory was incorporated into Czechoslovakia. \n\n  Slovakia is a landlocked country in Central Europe. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. The official language is Slovak. Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with a very high Human Development Index, a very high standard of living and performs favourably in measurements of civil liberties, press freedom, internet freedom, democratic governance and peacefulness. The country maintains a combination of market economy with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system. The country joined the European Union in 2004 and the Eurozone on 1 January 2009.

Proclaimed by American music critic, journalist, and music writer Harold C. Schonberg as \"the man who invented Beethoven\", Schnabel's pedagogical lineage included Beethoven himself. When he was around ten years old, he began studying with Theodor Leschetizky, who was a student of Carl Czerny, who was in turn Beethoven's student, close friend and assistant. In 1927, on the centenary of Beethoven's death, Schnabel performed all 32 Beethoven sonatas for the first time in \n\n Beethoven eventually returned to Vienna permanently in 1792, the year after Mozart's death. His early years in Vienna include many experiences similar to Mozart's own in the preceding years, and he became closely acquainted with some of Mozart's associates. In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Beethoven was also given patronage by Baron van Swieten, in whose home he played the works of Baroque masters, just as Mozart had done. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789. By the early 19th century Beethoven was a focus of Emanuel Schikaneder's attention; the impresario sponsored the sketch phases of Beethoven's intended opera Vestas Feuer, just as he had been the impetus for Mozart's The Magic Flute. (Beethoven eventually abandoned Vestas Feuer in favor of Fidelio.)\n\n Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, about 14 years after Mozart (born Salzburg, 1756). In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career. While Bonn was politically and culturally affiliated to Vienna, it was geographically even more remote than Salzburg, lying around 900 km distant on the opposite side of German-speaking Europe. During his youth and musical training in Bonn, Beethoven had extensive, intimate exposure to Mozart's music. He played Mozart piano concertos with the Bonn court orchestra and performed (playing viola) in Mozart's operas. Indeed, Lewis Lockwood writes, \"Just as Mozart had once told his father that he was 'soaked in music', so Beethoven was soaked in Mozart.\" In \n\n The compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven consist of 722 works written over forty-five years, from his earliest work in 1782 (variations for piano on a march by Ernst Christoph Dressler) when he was only eleven years old and still in Bonn, until his last work just before his death in Vienna in 1827. Beethoven composed works in all the main genres of classical music, including symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas and the opera. His works range from requiring a solo performer to needing a large orchestra and chorus to perform. Beethoven straddled both the Classical and Romantic periods, working in genres associated with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and \n\n Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), German composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for piano, 32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets. He also composed other chamber music, choral works (including the celebrated Missa Solemnis), and songs.  He has been labeled a deist as well. ; Caspar David Friedrich (1774–1840), German Romantic landscape painter. ; Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854), German philosopher. ; Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), Danish physicist \n\nQuestion: what music period did beethoven live in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Walnut Grove may be the most recognized name of all the towns Wilder wrote about in her books (although it is the only town she did not mention by name) because Michael Landon's television series Little House on the Prairie of the 1970s and 1980s was set here. Although the show depicts the family as living here through Wilder's adulthood, in reality, they only lived here a few years.\n\n Nellie Oleson appeared in three of the Little House novels Ingalls Wilder: On the Banks of Plum Creek (1937), Little Town on the Prairie (1939), and These Happy Golden Years (1943) — the fourth, seventh, and eighth in the series. Laura is 13 to 15 years old in the two intervening novels. On the Banks of Plum Creek alone is set in Minnesota, near Walnut Grove where the long-running television series is set. In that novel Laura is 7 to 9 years old. Oleson also stars in Nellie Oleson Meets Laura Ingalls, a book by Tui T. Sutherland (as Heather Williams), published by HarperCollins in 2007. The Library of Congress catalog summary is \"Wealthy, spoiled Nellie Oleson is only happy when she is the center of attention, and so she feels angry and left out when Laura Ingalls, a poor country girl, moves to Walnut Grove and is embraced by Nellie's friends and schoolteacher.\" Nellie Oleson Meets Laura Ingalls is one among dozens of Little House series extensions published beginning in the 1990s.\n\n Pepin, Wisconsin, is the birthplace of author Laura Ingalls Wilder. In Little House in the Big Woods, the first book in her Little House series, Laura's father visits Lake Pepin in the first chapter and her family visits the lake in the \"Going to Town\" chapter. Laura's family and their covered wagon then cross the frozen Lake Pepin in the chapter \"Going West\", the first chapter of the second book, Little House on the Prairie.\n\n Almanzo Wilder was born the fifth of six children to farmers James (1813–1899) and Angeline Day Wilder (1821–1905) on their farm outside Malone in Burke, New York. His siblings include Laura Ann (1844–1899), Royal Gould (1847–1925), Eliza Jane (1850–1930), Alice M. (1853–1892), and Perley Day (1869–1934). As part of her Little House series of autobiographical novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a book titled Farmer Boy about Wilder's childhood in upstate New York. Wilder is a well-known character in the Little House books where his wife wrote about their courtship and subsequent marriage in The Long Winter, Little Town on the Prairie, These Happy Golden Years, and The First Four Years. He also appeared briefly in chapter 28 ('Moving Day') of By the Shores of Silver Lake. Almanzo was characterized as a quietly courageous, hardworking man who loved horses and farming. \n\n Mansfield, Missouri, is the chosen final home town of Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was here, on her farm, that she wrote the Little House books. Each year the whole town celebrates with a festival, turning back the clock to the late 19th century. During the festival, the town square becomes a showcase for handmade crafts. There is a big parade, and folk music is played from the gazebo in the park.\n\nQuestion: what did laura ingalls wilder wrote?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

That session, presided by the oldest senator, proceeds to elect the president of the Senate for the following parliamentary period. On the first two attempts at voting, an absolute majority (a majority of all senators) is needed; if a third round is needed, a candidate can be elected by a majority of the senators present and voting. If this third round fails to produce a winner, a final ballot is held between the two senators with the highest votes in the previous ballot. In the case of a tie, the elder senator is deemed the winner. In addition to overseeing the business of the chamber, chairing and regulating debates, deciding whether motions and bills are admissible, representing the Senate, etc., the president of the Senate stands in for the president of the Republic when he is unable to perform his duties. The current president of the Senate is Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati. For a historical listing, see: List of presidents of the Senate of Italy.\n\n This is a list of the presidents of the Senate of Italy from the Kingdom of Sardinia to the present day. The President of the Senate of the Republic is the presiding officer of the Italian Senate. The President of the Senate is the second highest-ranking office of the Italian Republic (after the President of the Republic). The President of the Senate represents the Senate to external bodies, regulates debates in the Senate chamber by applying its regulations and the rules of the Italian Constitution, and regulates all the activities of its components in order to ensure that it functions correctly. The President of the Senate, along with the President of the Chamber of Deputies, must be consulted by the President of the Republic before the latter can dissolve one or both the chambers of the Italian Parliament.\n\n The constitution of Italy provides for two kinds of binding referendums. A legislative referendum can be called in order to abrogate a law totally or partially, if requested by 500,000 electors or five regional councils. This kind of referendum is valid only if at least a majority of electors goes to the polling station. It is forbidden to call a referendum regarding financial laws or laws relating to pardons or the ratification of international treaties. A constitutional referendum can be called in order to approve a constitutional law or amendment only when it has been approved by the Houses (Chamber of Deputies and Senate of the Republic) with a majority of less than two thirds in both or either House, and only at the request of one fifth of the members of either House, or 500,000 electors or five Regional Councils. A constitutional referendum is valid no matter how many electors go to the polling station. Any citizen entitled to vote in an election to the Chamber of Deputies may participate in a referendum.\n\n In Italy administrative law is known as \"'Diritto amministrativo\", a branch of public law whose rules govern the organization of the public administration and the activities of the pursuit of the public interest of the public administration and the relationship between this and the citizens. Its genesis is related to the principle of division of powers of the State. The administrative power, originally called \"executive\", is to organize resources and people whose function is devolved to achieve the public interest objectives as defined by the law.\n\n National-level elections in Italy are called periodically to form a parliament consisting of two houses: the Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) with 630 members; and the Senate of the Republic (Senato della Repubblica) with 315 elected members, plus a few appointed senators for life. Italy is a parliamentary republic: the President of the Republic is elected for a seven-year term by the two houses of Parliament in joint session, together with special electors appointed by the Regional Councils. During its history, Italy has had many political parties, both national and regional, with different party systems. The most recent Italian general election was held on 4 March 2018.\n\nQuestion: what type of government system does italy have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When you live with a condition that affects your whole body, you can be different from other people with your condition in a huge variety of ways. A disease that impacts a particular organ or system badly in one person may leave it relatively untouched in another. As a result, it can be hard for people without that condition—and sometimes even people who live with it themselves—to understand the full scope of experiences that are possible for patients.\nYet this understanding is critical to developing and improving health care resources, both in clinical settings and in the general community, for people with chronic conditions. My own experiences as a medical educator and health care advocate have shown me this important truth almost constantly over the years. Likewise, my own journey with cystic fibrosis (CF) has demonstrated where a lot of the gaps in health care lie—and how they could be improved by amplifying the voices of patients with diverse experiences.\nCF can be a tricky disease to describe because it affects almost every part of the body in some way. The basic gist of this condition is that instead of making a thin liquid that lubricates your tissue, your body instead makes something more like rubber cement. This happens because you either can’t make, can’t transport, or can’t use a specific protein that helps electrolytes move into and out of your cells. Because so many different tissues in the body require mucus to stay healthy, CF can do a lot of damage to different organs over time.\nTreatment for CF has improved a lot in recent decades. As a result, many people with the disease are now living long lives. However, as of right now there is no cure and no reasonable promise of one, meaning the disease still does a lot of damage as people grow older. Health care providers are thus seeing many more CF patients surviving to develop complications like kidney disease, which used to occur in only a small fraction of people with the condition because respiratory failure ended their lives first.\nAs someone who has lived with CF related kidney disease since my earliest adult years, I have learned a lot about what clinicians do and don’t know concerning my health care needs. I’ve also met other people with CF who didn’t know the disease could impact the kidneys! Like any other adult with CF, I have a unique cluster of complications that don’t match up exactly with those of most other patients. Unlike some adults with the disease, I don’t have clinical diabetes or liver problems. On the other hand, I have kidney disease and heart issues.\nWorking with clinicians and advocates who really understand the diversity of the CF population has opened my eyes to important opportunities for improving care for people with complex health conditions. When I got connected with a specialized CF team after moving to Orlando, I quickly learned a lot about how to keep my kidneys healthy and improve some of the symptoms I was experiencing. Over time, I began to feel much better physically and more empowered cognitively about managing my kidney issues. Because of this, I also changed my thinking about whether or not I would be willing to consider a kidney transplant in the future.\nI wrote about the lessons I learned from this journey in a manuscript called “Original Parts: Aging and Reckoning with Cystic Fibrosis Related Kidney Disease”. Last week, this paper was published in Patient Experience Journal. It’s a good example of how “writing where it hurts” can enrich academic literature as surely as it can expand general knowledge about improving care for people with health challenges. Likewise, open access journals like PXJ play an important role in making new information about patient experiences available far beyond university campuses!\nI feel excited about amplifying the voices of other people aging with CF using some of these new tools for writing, sharing, and learning. If you’d like to read the manuscript, it’s available here free of charge. As usual, let us know if you have any problems accessing the text—we will happily send you a PDF copy instead.\nThe author of this post is a transgender person conducting research on higher education in the United States. In Part One, they explained problems that emerge when cis researchers approach gender and transgender experience without paying attention to their own cis standpoints, assumptions, and biases, and issues this may cause for trans and gender nonconforming populations. In Part Two, they shared the first part of some explanations from cisgender allies seeking to do transgender-inclusive work as an illustration for ways cis researchers may approach gender in more expansive, inclusive, and empirical ways beyond cisgender binaries and assumptions. Here, in Part Three, they share the rest of their informal interviews with these scholars picking up at question 3.\nHow do you hold yourself accountable for gender-expansive praxis?\nScholar #1: I try to be honest with myself about … if I’m really asking those questions and pushing on those assumptions consistently. I look for feedback from folks who are not cis, and who are knowledgeable about trans* sexual violence, and I welcome it. I step back when I think I might be going down a scholarly road that isn’t my place. I’ll always seek to amplify and center the voices of actual trans* scholars in these areas, because my contribution (as I see it) is really about challenging cis folk to do better, but not to speak for or in place of trans* scholars or survivors. Lately, I’ve been focusing my energy on challenging the poor practices of national organizations, like ATIXA and ACPA, who continue to market “solutions” to sexual violence that either ignore or obscure the complexity of these issues. Recently, for example, ACPA sent out several promotional emails about the Peter Lake seminars which focus entirely on “compliance” (the program is even called, problematically, Compliance U.) and which totally disregard the social and cultural complexities of prevention work. This seems quite at odds with ACPA’s broader commitment to approaching change in higher education through an anti-oppression lens, and it’s concerning to me.\nScholar #2: I think that holding myself accountable starts with my inner work. I’m the first to acknowledge that I’m a work in progress and don’t always get it right. But when I have a situation where I perhaps misgendered someone or don’t adequately understand something, I work to take responsibility, apologize, and then get to work to learn more. I read articles and seek to learn more about gender-expansive praxis, whether that’s staying current on the terminology, listening to discussions on issues that pertain to gender diverse individuals, or reading up on what issues need to be faced next. As a cisgender queer man, I try to listen to understand and emphasize, and I engage in self-reflection about how to use my privilege to advocate and amplify with others. I have critical conversations with friends, some who may be trans or gender non-conforming and others who aren’t, around issues pertaining to gender, and I find these play a central role in the advocacy work that I can help engage with. A big part of my work is also to model to my students their need to do their own work. I talk openly in the classroom about the ways that I might make mistakes and need to learn more, which is an important aspect of accountability. Yet, I also want them to know that they’ll get things wrong too and that it’s important for us to learn together in community and work to get it right. These are all important practice that come to mind around holding myself accountable.\nWhy is gender-expansive research and practice important to you? What about to the field of higher education?\nScholar #1: In my life, I’ve come to understand a few things about social change work. One is that we’re stronger together, when we work across coalitions and join forces to address persistent social problems like sexual violence. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, I really believe this. But I also think it’s imperative for each of us to figure out how we can get outside of only our own oppression and work actively to end another’s, lest we become a bit too myopic and self-serving in how we do the work. I can’t only, always, ever think about cis women’s oppression, though it is real and ending it is important to me. That can’t be the whole focus of my work, because then, I am only advancing myself and others like me. And I will say, that I think that being white and affluent means I need to think hard about how to do this work honorably. I need to be actively looking for ways to un-center myself and my concerns, because the culture at large constantly centers me. Also, people (especially social justice people) who only center themselves and their own concerns are, to me, a bit boring! I think we can all do more to end oppression for groups we don’t belong to, and I think we must, lest we become so deeply invested in our own identities and their shifting power terms that we lose sight of everything else.\nScholar #2: To me, gender-expansive research and practice is a moral imperative. It’s not political correctness or anything like that. It’s a moral imperative. We have an epidemic in this country of trans people, particularly trans women of color, being murdered at outrageous rates. Yet, there is little coverage of this outside of the trans community. Much of this is due to white supremacy and genderism. The intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and other identities becomes a moral imperative that should move humanity to take action. Research and practice is a part of that process. We have lots of folks who are deemed “thought leaders” or experts that have done brilliant work on isolated aspects of identity yet have a lot more trouble advocating for other identity groups and seeing the intersectional connections. I think that’s a problem. And so that’s why I think gender-expansive research and practice is important to me, my family of friends and kin, and the field of higher education. Gender-expansive research and practice asks and implores us to think intersectionally about the ways power, privilege, and oppression play out in particular ways. Yes, this work centers gender, but I can’t help but also think about the ways that it connects to race, religion, sexuality, and other dimensions of identity. Gender-expansive work helps us get to a larger place of understanding and avoids the erasure that often happens for individuals who often aren’t heard or seen. As someone who cares about education, I don’t want to contribute to a system where trans and gender nonconforming folx are continually forced to endure marginalizations and micro- and macroaggressions. Yet, I am aware that often they do. Gender-expansive praxis has the ability to correct that though, and that’s the work that I am committed to doing.\nWhy should all cisgender people be committed to gender-expansive research and practice?\nScholar #1: The simple answer is because it’s the right thing to do. Because being cis, being a cis woman, means any fear we feel about our own safety and agency in the world is always mediated by our cisness, and that if we lose sight of that, we lose sight of what makes identities both so powerful and disempowering. Gender is powerful, and beautiful, in all its multiplicity, but only if we truly allow people of all genders to flourish, thrive, and live safely. And clearly, we have so much work to do to end sexual violence, but it’s only going to be meaningful if everyone is at the table, if everyone’s safety and agency is equally valued and honored. That’s my cause, and as long as I have breath, I’m sticking to it!\nScholar #2: Because it’s the right thing to do. Simply, it is. Gender-expansive research and practice actually benefits all of us. This is not a zero-sum game. To engage in gender-expansive work, we are just allowing for a deeper, more rich understanding of what gender is and what it can be. It also allows for a greater understanding of who we are, individually, as it relates to gender. Gender-expansive work says that we don’t have to be restricted by boxes and labels unnecessarily if we don’t want. It opens up new possibilities, and what’s wrong with that? As a cisgender individual, I have learned over time the immense privileges I have because of that identity. And there are choices to be made with that privilege. I choose to amplify gender-expansive praxis because I think that a more equitable world and field of higher education is important. We need more cisgender people using their privilege to think more critically about engaging in this line of work. Little changes can lead to bigger changes. If you feel scared or worried about making mistakes or saying the wrong thing, reach out to folks who you think are engaging in the work well. They’re out there. Don’t make our trans and gender nonconforming friends, colleagues, or students do the labor for you though. There are things that you must do on your own. You must do your own work. But we need you to do that work and also other work in community with others too. Don’t do this to rescue others or be the cisgender savior. Do this work because it’s the right thing to do for our collective humanity.\n\nThe exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" contributes to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, including their guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. The poem portrays the interactions and tensions between Christabel and Geraldine on a visceral and psychological level, rather than simply attributing their actions to supernatural or demonic influences. By examining the implications of a lesbian act in the world of \"Christabel,\" we can gain insight into the complexities of the characters.\n\nOne aspect that stands out is the reversal of gender expectations in the sexual relationship between Christabel and Geraldine. Their \"unnatural\" sexuality is marked by the manipulation of traditional gender roles, which challenges societal norms and reinforces the idea of sexual transgression. This reversal adds depth to the characters' dynamics, highlighting the power dynamics and exploring the boundaries of gender roles.\n\nFurthermore, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in the poem can also shed light on the characters' feelings of guilt and pleasure. Geraldine's guilt may stem from societal expectations and the internalized shame associated with deviating from traditional heterosexual relationships. Christabel, on the other hand, experiences pleasure in her interactions with Geraldine, suggesting a sense of liberation and self-discovery.\n\nThe manipulation of gender roles and the depiction of lesbian sexuality also provide a contrast to the homosocial bond between Sir Leoline and Sir Roland in Part II of the poem. The knights serve as a foil, representing the existing power structure and reinforcing the characters' deviation from the patriarchal norms. They not only define the extent of the two women's deviance but also offer a way for the characters to potentially reclaim conventional social roles.\n\nOverall, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" adds depth to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. It challenges societal expectations, highlights power dynamics, and delves into the complexities of human relationships and sexual identity.\n\nIn his novel \"Midnight's Children,\" Salman Rushdie uses alcohol and alcoholism to delve into the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule.\n\nOne of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Alcohol becomes a symbol through which the characters in the novel negotiate their identities and navigate the changing social and political landscapes. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one.\n\nAnother way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority.\n\nFurthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire. He highlights the negative health consequences associated with excessive drinking and the toll it takes on individuals and society. By incorporating medical sources related to alcohol and inebriation, Rushdie sheds light on the detrimental effects of both personal and societal reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism or means of escape.\n\nOverall, Salman Rushdie's use of alcohol and alcoholism in \"Midnight's Children\" offers a multi-dimensional perspective on the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking.\n\n Speak No Evil is a 2018 novel by Nigerian American writer Uzodinma Iweala. In his second novel, Iweala explores the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality and the diaspora through the story of Niru, a Nigerian-American high-school senior living in a middle-class suburb of Washington, D.C., who comes out as gay to his white straight friend Meredith. The first two thirds of the book are narrated by Niru while the last third is narrated by Meredith. Niru must learn how to negotiate his many identities: being a Black man in America, being the child of Nigerian immigrants, coming from a middle-class background, as well as being gay. Niru is forced to confront the many ways in which he is privileged, as well as disenfranchised. Iweala also interweaves themes of religion, cultural dislocation, mental health, police brutality, and more, all of which further add to and further complicate Niru's life and identities.\n\nQuestion: what did john irving wrote?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has now been found in all 10 Canadian Provinces and all 48 of the states in the contiguous United States. Rudbeckia hirta is the state flower of Maryland.\n\n Touchardia latifolia, commonly known as olonā in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering shrub in the nettle family, Urticaceae. T. latifolia is endemic to Hawaii and inhabits mesic valleys and wet forests at elevations of 70 - 1200 m. Typical to many Hawaiian plants, the olonā does not have the stinging hairs of its mainland cousins. It is found on all the main Hawaiian islands except Kahoolawe and Niihau. Olonā has alternate leaves whose shape greatly varies depending upon the environment from thin lancolate to broad elliptic. The large range in leaf variation once divided T. latifolia into more than 10 species, which are currently considered to be one. Olonā typically flowers between the months of May through December The female flowers are borne on branching cymes which become fleshy orange berry-like achenes, and the male flowers are white. Olonā is easily cultivated (83% germination rate), and sprouts readily from cuttings, but does not transplant well due to its fragile roots.\n\n Houstonia rosea, the rose bluet, is a North American plant species in the coffee family. It is a tiny plant only a few centimeters tall, with pink flowers.

The pair presents a plan to the National American Woman's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) to campaign directly in Washington D.C. for national voting rights for women. They find that their ideas are too forceful for the established suffragist leaders in the U.S., particularly Carrie Chapman Catt, but they are allowed to lead the NAWSA Congressional Committee in D.C. They start by organizing the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession on the eve of President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration.

In 1912, Alice Paul became co-chair of the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Paul, who was a Quaker from New Jersey learned militant suffrage tactics in England. She moved to Washington D.C. and rented a basement room to house the NAWSA committee. By April 1913, Paul and Lucy Burns started the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) to lobby for a federal suffrage amendment. NAWSA removed Paul and Burns from the Congressional Committee and \n\n and no longer held national posts. In 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker Lucy Burns organized the Woman Suffrage Procession, a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration as president. Onlookers who opposed the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order.

The south fork is one of those spots above Peter Cave, this area produced a larger number of bass and crappie. Both upper ends of the lakes two forks are more fertile than the lower spots around the lake. This lake supports populations of many species of fish including, largemouth bass, spotted bass, hybrid striped bass, catfish, crappie, white bass, and bluegill. In the tributaries there are a remnant population of smallmouth bass that stay in this area. There are limited tailwater fishing opportunities on the Rough River Lake, unfortunately there are no boating launches in the tailwaters and the access decreases moving down the lake due to private properties. Walleye were stocked in this lake from 1976 to 1978 but the fishery never developed so the number of these fish are very small. Rainbow trout are stocked every month but November and December, the number of Rainbow trout’s average to about 11,600 fish annually.\n\n Fishing is another popular activity in the Halifax River. Fishing is allowed from boats, the banks of the river, or from any of the bridges crossing the waterway. Some of the species that can be found include: trout, catfish, flounder, sheepshead, tarpon, snook, black drum, mangrove snapper and red drum.\n\n The lake is a popular fishing spot partly because it is close to the St. Regis River which is stocked with over 10,000 trout each year. The lake itself harbors different species of fish including splake, atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout, american eel, lake trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and brown bullhead. It can be fished year-round and there is a NYSDEC carry-down boat launch located on Lake Ozonia Road. The lake may only be accessed by a non-motorized boat or a motorized boat with a 10 horsepower or less motor.\n\n The park has a number of streams and lakes for fishing. The park also has a few fishing events and permit-free days. Expect to catch small panfish, largemouth bass, and pike.\n\n The County Park waters are stocked with trout and bass, notably at these following spots. Glen Rock Duck Pond: The Glen Rock Duck Pond primarily has bass and sunfish, although people have caught carp and even catfish here. Waterfall Area: This is the most popular fishing spot in the County Park. The area directly downstream of the waterfall has fast moving water, bubble water, in which people catch stocked trout and bass. The area also has sunfish, carp, and white suckers. The waterfall is specifically the widest spot to fish on the Saddle River, which follows along this trail. There are other spots along the Saddle River to fish on, but none as open as this spot. Otto Pehle: The Otto Pehle lake primarily has bass and sunfish, although some people have caught carp and catfish here. Can get bloated on the weekends. Ridgewood Duck Pond: The Ridgewood Duck Pond was formerly a fishing spot, but in recent years the pond has dried up substantially and there are either a few or no fish left.\n\nQuestion: where to go fishing in roanoke va?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Nicaragua, the voseo form of Spanish is dominant in both speech and publications. The first nation to formally adopt the voseo dialect, Nicaragua is one two Central American nations (Costa Rica is the other) that use voseo Spanish as its written and spoken form of the language. The usage is also seen in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and coastal Colombia. In the Caribbean coast, many Afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language, but they speak a very fluent Spanish as a second language. The languages in the North and South Atlantic Regions are influenced by English, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Many of the indigenous people on the Caribbean coast speak native languages such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language. In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua have maintained their ancestral languages, while also speaking Spanish or English; these include Chinese, Arabic, German, Hawaiian, and Italian.

Meehan was professionally nicknamed \"The Baron\" by his many admirers and friends within the British pop-rock music industry. He is reckoned to have influenced many thousands of teenage boys and adolescents to take up music as a career, including Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, as a result of his iconic film performance in Cliff Richard's film The Young Ones. His drumming style (cf. \"Bongo Blues\", \"Apache\") is noticeably different from that of other drummers that the Shadows employed during 1958–2010 such as Brian Bennett, Clem Cattini and Trevor Spencer.

Its title is a play on the title of the Sergio Leone \"Spaghetti Western\" film A Fistful of Dollars. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Worf, his son Alexander Rozhenko, and Deanna Troi are trapped in the holodeck where the characters resemble Data and have his superior abilities. This episode features a scene with Data in drag, and has numerous comedy elements.

Portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg, Guinan is a bartender in the Ten-Forward lounge aboard the starship USS Enterprise-D. She was also played as a child by Isis Carmen Jones in the episode \"Rascals\". The character first appears in the second-season opening episode \"The Child\", and makes recurring appearances during the next four seasons. She mainly works in Ten-Forward, which was added after most of the sets were recreated following the first season. The character is an alien who is several hundred years old and is noted for her warmth and folk wisdom, which she often uses to defuse difficult situations or comfort other characters aboard the ship as they struggle with something. In January 2020, Goldberg accepted a personal invitation from Patrick Stewart to reprise her role as Guinan for the second season of Star Trek: Picard, the continuation of Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\n scenes were filmed.

Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski was a hard-line Cold Warrior opposed to Communism and the USSR. Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball as Secretary of State, but he was vetoed by Brzezinski as too dovish. Vance negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties, along with peace talks in Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. He worked closely \n\n  Since the 1960s, Panama had called for the United States to cede control of the Panama Canal. The bipartisan national policy of turning over the Canal to Panama had been established by presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, but negotiations had dragged on for a dozen years. Carter made the cession of the Panama Canal a priority, believing it would implement his call for a moral cleaning of American foreign policy and win approval across Latin America as a gracious apology for American wrongdoing. He also feared that another postponement of negotiations might precipitate violent upheaval in Panama, which could damage or block the canal. The Carter administration negotiated \n\n The Presidency of Ronald Reagan, starting in January 1981, decided that the Carter administration had largely failed in Africa, and sharply changed directions. It abandoned the Carter emphasis on human rights, and instead emphasized anti-communism. This meant reversals of policies in South Africa and Angola, and changes in the USA's relationships with Ethiopia and Libya, which were pro-Soviet. Carter's policy was to denounce and try to end the apartheid policies in South Africa and Angola, whereby small white minorities had full control of government. Under the new conservative administration a more conciliatory approach was taken by the Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker. He rejected \n\n The United States foreign policy during the presidency of Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) was dominated by the Cold War, a period of sustained geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Upon taking office, Jimmy Carter reoriented U.S. foreign policy towards a new emphasis on human rights, democratic values, nuclear non-proliferation, and global poverty. Carter ended U.S. support for the Somoza regime in Nicaragua and cut back or terminated military aid to Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Ernesto Geisel of Brazil, and Jorge Rafael Videla of Argentina, all of whom he criticized for human rights violations. He negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which provided for the return of the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. In an effort to end the Arab–Israeli conflict, he helped arrange the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. He also became the first U.S. president to visit Sub-Saharan Africa, a reflection \n\n promoting energy conservation and developing alternative sources of energy. He wanted to not be dependent on foreign oil and reduce the use of fossil fuels. With international energy's future uncertain for America, Carter acted quickly to have the department come into action the first year of his presidency. This was an extremely important issue of the time as the oil crisis was causing shortages and inflation. With the Three-Mile Island disaster, Carter was able to intervene with the help of the department. Carter made switches within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in this case to fix the management and procedures. This was possible as nuclear energy and weapons are responsibility of the Department of Energy.\n\nQuestion: what did president carter do in office?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Crennel retained the base 3-4 defense and named Johnson and Javon Belcher the starting inside linebackers to begin the regular season. The pair were joined by outside linebackers Justin Houston and Tamba Hali. On November 12, 2012, Johnson collected a season-high 13 combined tackles (12 solo) in the Chiefs' 16–13 loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 10. The following week, he made ten solo tackles during a 28–6 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 11. On December 26, 2012, it was announced that Johnson was voted to the 2013 Pro Bowl. On December 31, 2012, the Kansas City Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel after they finished fourth in the AFC West with a 4–12 record.

It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines.  Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome.  Given the uncertain health effects of low-dose radiation, cancer deaths cannot be ruled out. However, studies by the World Health Organisation and Tokyo University have shown that no discernible increase in the rate of cancer deaths is expected. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged in the academic literature from none to hundreds.\n\nMany deaths are attributed to the evacuation and subsequent long-term displacement following emergency mass evacuation.  For evacuation, the estimated number of deaths during and immediately after transit range from 34 to \"greater than 50\". The victims include hospital inpatients and elderly people at nursing facilities who died from causes such as hypothermia, deterioration of underlying medical problems, and dehydration.\n\nFor long-term displacement, many people (mostly sick and elderly) died at an increased rate while in temporary housing and shelters.  Degraded living conditions and separation from support networks are likely contributing factors.  , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. \"Disaster-related deaths\" are deaths attributed to disasters and are not caused by direct physical trauma, but does not distinguish between people displaced by the nuclear disaster compared to the earthquake / tsunami.  As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. Reports have pointed out that many of these deaths may have been caused by the evacuation period being too long, and that residents could have been allowed to return to their homes earlier in order to reduce the total related death toll. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”.\n\nAt least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 175 (0.7%) have received significant radiation doses. Workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. After hearing opinions from a panel of radiologists and other experts, the ministry ruled that the man's family should be paid compensation.\n\nThe Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima.\n\nSummary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.\n\nAs the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.\n\nIn the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.\n\nConcerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.\n\nJapanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.\n\nRadiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\".\n\nReports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.\n\nUNSCEAR Report \nAnnex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv).  About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35).  No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38).  Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30).  No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39).  Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv.\n\nWHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.\n\nThe WHO calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, infants, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of cancer (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for thyroid cancer, due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%]. Cancer risks for the unborn child are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.\n\nThe estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.\nAbout one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.\n\nNo increase is expected in the incidence of congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to within the womb radiation exposure. As no radiation induced inherited effects/heritable effects, nor teratogenic effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received radiotherapy, and the children of the Hibakusha, not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants.\n\nOther reports\n\nMajor news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from \"disaster conditions\" following the earthquake. \"The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\"\n\nA Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster.  They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone.\n\nOn 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.\n\nIn a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.\n\nThe wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high.\n\nAccording to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.\n\nIn April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the US, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.\n\n, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.\n\nWorkers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat. , 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure.\n\n, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases. A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.\n\nAccording to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by \"fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster\".\n\nAccording to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.\n\nThese numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.\n\nFinally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died.\nThose who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster.\n\nThe author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. In their final 1981 report, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.\n\nAnother cause of death is the increased number of suicides due to mental stress, despair, anxiety and depression caused by media coverage, and through long periods of evacuation.\n\nPerinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.\n\nSee also\n List of civilian nuclear accidents\n Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents\n Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English\n Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report\n Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report – An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012\n Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4\n Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company\n Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building\n TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company\n NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan\n JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum\n JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency\n IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency\n Nature Journal – Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis\n TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake\n Documentary photographs: residential damage within \"No Go\" Zone\n In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012\n PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster   \n \"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\nThe  was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines.  Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome.  Given the uncertain health effects of low-dose radiation, cancer deaths cannot be ruled out. However, studies by the World Health Organisation and Tokyo University have shown that no discernible increase in the rate of cancer deaths is expected. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged in the academic literature from none to hundreds.\n\nMany deaths are attributed to the evacuation and subsequent long-term displacement following emergency mass evacuation.  For evacuation, the estimated number of deaths during and immediately after transit range from 34 to \"greater than 50\". The victims include hospital inpatients and elderly people at nursing facilities who died from causes such as hypothermia, deterioration of underlying medical problems, and dehydration.\n\nFor long-term displacement, many people (mostly sick and elderly) died at an increased rate while in temporary housing and shelters.  Degraded living conditions and separation from support networks are likely contributing factors.  , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. \"Disaster-related deaths\" are deaths attributed to disasters and are not caused by direct physical trauma, but does not distinguish between people displaced by the nuclear disaster compared to the earthquake / tsunami.  As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. Reports have pointed out that many of these deaths may have been caused by the evacuation period being too long, and that residents could have been allowed to return to their homes earlier in order to reduce the total related death toll. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”.\n\nAt least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 175 (0.7%) have received significant radiation doses. Workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. After hearing opinions from a panel of radiologists and other experts, the ministry ruled that the man's family should be paid compensation.\n\nThe Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima.\n\nSummary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.\n\nAs the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.\n\nIn the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.\n\nConcerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.\n\nJapanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.\n\nRadiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\".\n\nReports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.\n\nUNSCEAR Report \nAnnex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv).  About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35).  No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38).  Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30).  No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39).  Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv.\n\nWHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.\n\nThe WHO calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, infants, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of cancer (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for thyroid cancer, due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%]. Cancer risks for the unborn child are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.\n\nThe estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.\nAbout one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.\n\nNo increase is expected in the incidence of congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to within the womb radiation exposure. As no radiation induced inherited effects/heritable effects, nor teratogenic effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received radiotherapy, and the children of the Hibakusha, not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants.\n\nOther reports\n\nMajor news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from \"disaster conditions\" following the earthquake. \"The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\"\n\nA Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster.  They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone.\n\nOn 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.\n\nIn a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.\n\nThe wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high.\n\nAccording to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.\n\nIn April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the US, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.\n\n, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.\n\nWorkers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat. , 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure.\n\n, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases. A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.\n\nAccording to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by \"fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster\".\n\nAccording to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.\n\nThese numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.\n\nFinally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died.\nThose who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster.\n\nThe author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J.

Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.\n\nSee also\n List of civilian nuclear accidents\n Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents\n Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English\n Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report\n Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report – An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012\n Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4\n Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company\n Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building\n TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company\n NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan\n JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum\n JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency\n IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency\n Nature Journal – Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis\n TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake\n Documentary photographs: residential damage within \"No Go\" Zone\n In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012\n PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster   \n \"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n in cleaning Chernobyl and 10,800 square miles were contaminated. Social scientist and energy policy expert, Benjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define major energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages.

Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl Reactor's proximity to floodplains. A study conducted in 1996 was conducted to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes traced from the disaster area. Fish collected from the lake were found to be 60 times more radioactive than the European Union Standard. Further investigation found that the water source feeding the lake provided drinking water for approximately 9 million Ukrainians, as well as provided agricultural irrigation and food for \n\n  The worst nuclear accident to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. The accident killed 31 people directly and damaged approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Estimates of eventual deaths from cancer are highly contested.

As a redshirt sophomore, Mitchell played middle linebacker and was second on his team in tackles with 103. The same year, he led the Spartans in conference play with 10.6 tackles a game. He recorded his career-high 17 tackles while playing against Ohio State. Mitchell was forced to hang up his cleats for good in 2005 due to damaged cartilage in his knee. He continued his education and graduated from Michigan State with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice and Security Management. His nickname, \"Mayhem,\" was given to him by his football teammate, Jason Teague. Following Mitchell’s college graduation, he circulated resumes in search of a job that would allow him to utilize his degree. One evening, he watched a former Notre Dame football opponent, Tom Zbikowski, win his professional boxing debut at Madison Square Garden. He decided to put his career in criminal justice on hold.\n\n finished his college career having completed 722 of 1,202 attempts for 9,287 yards and seventy-four touchdowns, and was a team captain and the Gators' most valuable player during his final season. He led the SEC in passing for three consecutive years (1990–1992), and finished with a career efficiency rating of 137.6. Matthews graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1997, and he was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 2002. In a 2006 article series regarding the top 100 Florida Gators from the first 100 years of Florida football, The Gainesville Sun recognized him as the No. 9 all-time Gator player.\n\n of Southern California, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American for the USC Trojans football team as a senior. He was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Oilers. He was a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, tied for the most in NFL history, and a nine-time first-team All-Pro. Matthews was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, and his number 74 jersey is retired by the Titans. After retiring as a player, Matthews served as an assistant coach for the Houston Texans and Titans. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the brother of linebacker Clay Matthews Jr.; father of center Kevin Matthews and tackle Jake Matthews; and uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III and linebacker Casey Matthews.\n\n Matthews accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, and was the starting quarterback for the Gators teams under coach Steve Spurrier from 1990 to 1992. In Matthews' first season as a starter in 1990, the Gators finished 9–2 overall and a league best record of 6–1 in the Southeastern Conference (SEC); in his second season in 1991, the Gators finished 10–2 overall and 7–0 in the SEC, winning their first official SEC football championship. Matthews set a new Gators team record for career passing yards (later surpassed), finished fifth in the 1991 Heisman Trophy voting as a junior, and was a first-team All-SEC selection in 1990, 1991 and 1992. \n\n Matthews was born in Cleveland, Mississippi in 1970. He attended Cleveland High School in Cleveland through his sophomore year, before transferring to Pascagoula High School in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where he played high school football for the Pascagoula Panthers.

The current General Secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012, and was re-elected on 25 October 2017. The electoral system is pyramidal. Local People's Congresses are directly elected, and higher levels of People's Congresses up to the National People's Congress (NPC) are indirectly elected \n\n the People's Congress of the level immediately below. Another eight political parties, have representatives in the NPC and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China supports the Leninist principle of \"democratic centralism\", but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a \"rubber stamp\" body. Since both the CCP and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) promote according to seniority, it is possible to discern distinct generations of Chinese leadership. In official discourse, each group of leadership is identified with a distinct extension of the ideology of the party. Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the People's Republic of China by reference to these \"generations\".\n\n The Multi-Party Cooperation and Political Consultation System is led by the CCP in cooperation and consultation with the eight parties which make up the United Front. Consultation takes place under the leadership of the CCP, with mass organizations, the United Front parties, and \"representatives from all walks of life\". These consultations contribute, at least in theory, to the formation of the country's basic policy in the fields of political, economic, cultural and social affairs. The CCP's relationship with other parties is based on the principle of \"long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal or woe.\" This process is institutionalized in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). All the parties in the United Front support China's road to socialism, and hold steadfast to the leadership of the CCP. Despite all this, the CPPCC is a body without any real power. While discussions do take place, they are all supervised by the CCP.\n\nFor the USSR body, see Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  The Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, formally known as the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and known as the Central Bureau before 1927, is the decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Currently, it is a group of 25 top officials who oversee the CCP. Unlike politburos of other Communist parties, power within the Chinese politburo is further centralized in the Politburo Standing Committee, a group of 7 individuals from among the 25 top officials. The Politburo is nominally elected by the Central Committee. In practice, however, scholars of Chinese elite politics believe that the Politburo \n\n China is a one-party state led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, Xi Jinping, to remain president of China (and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party) for an unlimited time, earning criticism for creating dictatorial governance. The President is the titular head of state, elected by the National People's Congress. The Premier is the head of government, presiding over the State Council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions.

Newark Liberty is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the other two major airports in the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA), along with three smaller airports including Teterboro Airport. It is about 15 mi southwest of Midtown Manhattan (New York City). In addition to domestic flights, Newark Liberty has extensive international service covering all inhabited continents except for Oceania. United Airlines operates its third-largest hub at the facility, after O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, and George W. Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, making it the airport's largest tenant. In 2001, Continental Airlines began non-stop service between \n\n LaGuardia Airport (LGA), the smallest of New York area's primary airports, handles domestic air service and flights to Canada. It is named for Fiorello H. La Guardia, the city's Depression-era mayor known as a reformist and strong supporter of the New Deal. The airport is located in northern Queens, about 6 mi from downtown Manhattan. In 1984, a \"perimeter rule\" was introduced to reduce congestion, which prohibits incoming and outgoing flights that exceed 1,500 miles (2,400 km) except on Saturdays, when the ban is lifted, and to Denver, Colorado, which has a grandfathered exemption. As a result, most transcontinental and international flights use JFK and Newark (although there are short-haul international flights to the Canadian cities of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa). Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport itself in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities, and this project would accommodate a new AirTrain LaGuardia connection.\n\n Teterboro Airport is the oldest operating airport in the New York metropolitan area. Walter C. Teter (1863–1929) acquired the property in 1917. While other localities had municipal airports, New York City itself had a multitude of private airfields, and thus did not see the need for a municipal airport until the late 1920s. Flushing Airport opened in 1927, quickly becoming the city's busiest airport; it closed in 1984. Newark Liberty International Airport opened in 1928. It was followed by Floyd Bennett Field in 1930; New York City's first municipal airport, it built largely in response to the growth of commercial aviation after World War I. LaGuardia Airport was opened in 1939, and Floyd Bennett Field was closed for general aviation two years later. John F. Kennedy International Airport opened as Idlewild Airport in 1948.\n\n  The New York metropolitan area has the busiest airport system in the United States and the second busiest in the world after London. It is also the most frequently used port of entry and departure for international flights. In 2011, more than 104 million passengers used the airports under the auspices of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). The number increased to 117 million in 2014. The metro area is served by three major airports, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA), which have been operated by the Port Authority since 1947. The International Air Transport Association airport code (IATA code) \"NYC\" is reserved to refer to these three airports. JFK and Newark are connected to regional rail systems by AirTrain JFK and \n\n The first municipal airport in New York City was Floyd Bennett Field, developed to lure business away from Newark, but it was ultimately unsuccessful as a general aviation airport and closed in 1941. It is now a historic, recreational, and sporting area and part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which is in turn part of the National Park System (NPS). The New York City Police Department leases facilities for their helicopter operations from the NPS there. Flushing Airport was another early airport in New York City. It opened in 1927 and was the busiest airport in New York for a time. A decade later it was overshadowed by the larger LaGuardia Airport located nearby. The airport was decommissioned in 1984 after a fatal accident in 1977.

From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 9 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (4.5 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants). Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Brás, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, \n\n The Americas have been known to be some of the most multicultural geographical locations, with a diversity of language, religion, and ethnicity. The South American country Brazil can also acclaim multiculturalism, and has undergone many changes in the past few decades. Brazil is a controversial country when it comes to defining a multicultural country. There are two views: the Harvard Institute of Economic Research states that Brazil has an intersection of many cultures because of recent migration, while the Pew Research Center state that Brazil is culturally diverse but the majority of the country speaks Portuguese. Cities such as São Paulo are home to migrants from Japan, Italy, Lebanon and Portugal. There is a multicultural presence within in this city, and this is prevalent throughout Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil is a country that has made great strides to embrace migrant cultures. There has been increased awareness of anti-blackness and active efforts to combat racism.\n\n Brazil (Brasil; ), officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: ), is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the \n\n Brazil is the largest country in which Portuguese is spoken in all of the Americas, with a population of approximately 220 million people, almost all of whom are native speakers of Portuguese.

The bolívar was adopted by the monetary law of 1879, replacing the short-lived venezolano at a rate of five bolívares to one venezolano. Initially, the bolívar was defined on the silver standard, equal to 4.5 g fine silver, following the principles of the Latin Monetary Union. The monetary law of 1887 made the gold bolívar unlimited legal tender, and the gold standard came into full operation in 1910. Venezuela went off gold in 1930, and in 1934, the bolívar exchange rate was fixed in terms of the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.914 bolívares = 1 U.S. dollar, revalued to 3.18 bolívares = 1 U.S. dollar in 1937, a rate which lasted until 1941. Until 18 February 1983 (now called, Spanish for Black Friday, by many Venezuelans), the bolívar had been the region's most stable and internationally accepted currency. It then fell prey to high devaluation. Exchange controls were imposed on February 5, 2003, to limit capital flight. The rate was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate of Bs 1,600 to the dollar.\n\n has been adopted as the official currency of several other countries. However, semi-dollarization also exists in a few other countries where the U.S. dollar is recognised as legal tender alongside another currency, and unofficial dollarization exists in many areas where the U.S. dollar is widely used and accepted-although it is not recognised as legal tender. Ecuador uses the United States dollar (the French overseas department French Guiana uses the euro, the currency of France). The Brazilian real is considered a strong South American currency; under presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, the real almost tripled in value, resulting in a vast change \n\n Túmin is an alternative currency used in the municipality of Espinal, Veracruz, Mexico. Its name means \"money\" in the Totonac language. (Note that this word in Totonac is borrowed from the old Spanish coin the \"tomín\" [www.rae.es]). Espinal is a municipality of some 2600 inhabitants, 19% of whom are indigenous Totonac people. Used as a complementary currency, the Tumin was first put in circulation in 2010 as a student project at the Intercultural University of Veracruz, where students were trying to find ways of strengthening the local economy. In Espinal the access to cash is scarce as most people work for the minimum \n\n Currency: Balboa (since 1904) Symbol: B/.

Cuba and Panama both use two currencies. Cuba is attempting to gradually phase out the Cuban convertible peso, unifying the two in the Cuban peso. Although there is no confirmed timescale for the reform, whilst quoting Cuban economists, Reuters gave an estimation of 18 months (from October 2013).

Its water is used for irrigation and for hydroelectric powe r. It is the largest tributary of the Zambezi, and of Zambia's principal rivers, it is the most central and the most urban. More than 50% of Zambia's population live in the Kafue River Basin and of these around 65% are urban. It has a mean flow rate of 320 m³/s through its lower half, with high seasonal variations. The river discharges 10 km³ per year into the Zambezi River.\n\n The Levubu River or Levuvhu (Rivubye; Luvuvhu) is located in the northern Limpopo province of South Africa. Some of its tributaries, such as the Mutshindudi River and Mutale River rise in the Soutpansberg Mountains. The Luvuvhu River flows for about 200 km through a diverse range of landscapes before it joins the Limpopo River in the Fever Tree Forest area, near Pafuri in the Kruger National Park. A Zambezi shark (Carcharhinus leucas) was caught at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up rivers like the Limpopo.\n\n The Zambezi Region is situated is a tropical area, with high temperatures and much rainfall during the December-to-March rainy season, making it the wettest region of Namibia. The terrain is mostly made up of swamps, floodplains, wetlands and woodland. In addition to the Zambezi River, the strip also holds the Kwando River, which marks the border with Botswana. Tributaries of the river here go by different names, including the Linyanti and the Chobe. The province's far east is where the Kwando meets the Zambezi. Katima Mulilo is the largest city, with other notable villages and settlements including Chefuzwe, Lusese, Bukalo, Kalimbeza, Isize, Luhonono, Mafuta, Liselo, Musanga, Kongola, Chinchimane, Bukalo, Sibinda, and Impalila, along with Kayuo, Wenela, Mapulanga, Sambeso, Katembo, Siambiza, Luzibalule, Sachona, Lubuta, Mulanga, Mashambo, Omega Ill, Chetto, Bwabwata, Gaucha, Geusha, Yishesha, Sekrige, Singalamwe, Choi, Ngonga, Muneambuanas, Dipito, Sangwali, Photo, Sikwalo, Matengu, Yaka, Linyati, Muketela, Sibbinda, Chengere, Sebukis, Katonga, and Sachinga.\n\n Of the rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean, the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the Zambezi, whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E, at an elevation of 1500 m. It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of Lake Nyasa, flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the Taukhe (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the Okavango, is lost in a system \n\n The Zambezi River and several tributaries of the Congo River have their sources in Angola. A large number of rivers originate in the central uplands, but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied. A number flow in a more or less westerly course to the Atlantic Ocean, providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power, only some of which had been realized by 1988. Two of Angola's most important rivers, the Cuanza (Kwanza) and the Cunene (Kunene), take a more indirect route to the Atlantic, the Cuanza flowing north and the Cunene flowing south before turning west. The Cuanza is the only river wholly within Angola that is navigable—for nearly 200 kilometers from its mouth—by boats of commercially or militarily significant size.

The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, it has six regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide.\n\nThe WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The first meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the agency's governing body, took place on 24 July of that year. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Its work began in earnest in 1951 after a significant infusion of financial and technical resources.\n\nThe WHO's mandate seeks and includes: working worldwide to promote health, keeping the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. It advocates that a billion more people should have: universal health care coverage, engagement with the monitoring of public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting health and well-being. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. A publication, the World Health Report, provides assessments of worldwide health topics. The WHO also serves as a forum for discussions of health issues.\n\nThe WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. Its World Health Assembly, the agency's decision-making body, elects and advises an executive board made up of 34 health specialists. It selects the director-general, sets goals and priorities, and approves the budget and activities. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia.\n\nThe WHO relies on contributions from member states (both assessed and voluntary) and private donors for funding. Its total approved budget for 2020–2021 is over $7.2 billion, of which the majority comes from voluntary contributions from member states. Contributions are assessed by a formula that includes GDP per capita. Among the largest contributors were Germany (which contributed 12.18% of the budget), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.65%), and the United States (7.85%).\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\nThe International Sanitary Conferences (ISC), the first of which was held on 23 June 1851, were a series of conferences that took place until 1938, about 87 years.   The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. With the etiology, even the communicability, of many epidemic diseases still uncertain and a matter of scientific argument, international agreement on appropriate measures was difficult to reach.\nSeven of these international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before any resulted in a multi-state international agreement. The seventh conference, in Venice in 1892, finally resulted in a convention. It was concerned only with the sanitary control of shipping traversing the Suez Canal, and was an effort to guard against importation of cholera.\n\nFive years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. While Denmark, Sweden-Norway, and the USA did not sign this convention, it was unanimously agreed that the work of the prior conferences should be codified for implementation. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid.  In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau (1902), and the  (1907) were soon founded. When the League of Nations was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. After World War II, the United Nations absorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.\n\nEstablishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health. The use of the word \"world\", rather than \"international\", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.\n\nThe first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of (then ) for the 1949 year. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. The logo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a symbol for healing.\n\nActivities\n\nIAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 \n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women in Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence.\nIndependent WHO held a weekly vigil from 2007 to 2017 in front of WHO headquarters.\nHowever, as pointed out by Foreman in clause 2 it states:\n\nThe key text is highlighted in bold, the agreement in clause 2 states that the WHO is free to perform any health-related work.\n\nOperational history of WHO \n\n1947: The WHO established an epidemiological information service via telex.\n\n1950: A mass tuberculosis inoculation drive using the BCG vaccine gets under way.\n\n1955: The malaria eradication programme was launched, although objectives were later modified. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.)\n\n1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.\n\n1965: The first report on diabetes mellitus and the creation of the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\n1966: The WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the Palace of Nations to a newly constructed HQ elsewhere in Geneva.\n\n1967: The WHO intensified the global smallpox eradication campaign by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort and adopted a new disease surveillance method, at a time when 2 million people were dying from smallpox per year. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. After over two decades of fighting smallpox, a Global Commission declared in 1979 that the disease had been eradicated – the first disease in history to be eliminated by human effort.\n\n1974: The Expanded Programme on Immunization and the control programme of onchocerciasis was started, an important partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank.\n\n1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. The TDR's goals are, firstly, to support and coordinate international research into diagnosis, treatment and control of tropical diseases; and, secondly, to strengthen research capabilities within endemic countries.\n\n1976: The WHA enacted a resolution on disability prevention and rehabilitation, with a focus on community-driven care\n\n1977 and 1978: The first list of essential medicines was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of \"Health For All\" was declared.\n\n1986: The WHO began its global programme on HIV/AIDS. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed.\n\n1988: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established.\n\n1995: WHO established an independent International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication; ICCDE). The ICCDE recommends to WHO which countries fulfill requirements for certification. It also has role in advising on progress made towards elimination of transmission and processes for verification.\n\n1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.\n\n2000: The Stop TB Partnership was created along with the UN's formulation of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n2001: The measles initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007.\n\n2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available.\n\n2006: The organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support the plan to fight the AIDS pandemic.\n\n2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies.\n\n2020: WHO helped in controlling the world wide outbreak of corona virus (covid-19)\n\nPolicies and objectives\n\nOverall focus\nThe WHO's Constitution states that its objective \"is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health\".\n\nThe WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform.\n\n, the WHO has defined its role in public health as follows:\n providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;\n shaping the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation, and dissemination of valuable knowledge;\n setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;\n articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;\n providing technical support, catalysing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and\n monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.\n CRVS (civil registration and vital statistics) to provide monitoring of vital events (birth, death, wedding, divorce).\n\nCommunicable diseases\nThe 2012–2013 WHO budget identified five areas among which funding was distributed. Two of those five areas related to communicable diseases: the first, to reduce the \"health, social and economic burden\" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in particular.\n\n, the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.\n\nIn 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to the use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" , the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.\n\nDuring the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether RTS,S/AS01, were a viable malaria vaccine. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from tuberculosis, and since 2005, over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7 million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis, and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate polio. It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since WHO partnered with Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and smaller organizations. , it has been working to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared \"polio-free\". In 2017, a study was conducted as to why Polio Vaccines may not be enough to eradicate the Virus & conduct new technology. Polio is now on the verge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease.\n\nIn 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic influenza vaccine development through clinical trials in collaboration with many experts and health officials. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director-General Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading \"fear and confusion\" rather than \"immediate information\". Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to \"unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\".\n\nNon-communicable diseases\nOne of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of \"disease, disability and premature deaths from chronic noncommunicable diseases, mental disorders, violence and injuries, and visual impairment which are collectively responsible for almost 71% of all deaths worldwide\". The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Reproductive Health has published the magazine, Entre Nous, across Europe since 1983.\n\nWHO is mandated under two of the international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971) to carry out scientific assessments of substances for international drug control. Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The ECDD is in charge of evaluating \"the impact of psychoactive substances on public health\" and \"their dependence producing properties and potential harm to health, as well as considering their potential medical benefits and therapeutic applications.\"\n\nEnvironmental health\nThe WHO estimates that 12.6 million people died as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in 2012 –  this accounts for nearly 1 in 4 of total global deaths. Environmental risk factors, such as air, water, and soil pollution, chemical exposures, climate change, and ultraviolet radiation, contribute to more than 100 diseases and injuries. This can result in a number of pollution-related diseases.\n 2018 (30 October – 1 November) : 1 WHO's first global conference on air pollution and health (Improving air quality, combatting climate change – saving lives) ; organized in collaboration with UN Environment, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nLife course and life style\nWHO works to \"reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals\".\n\nIt also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for \"health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and unsafe sex\".\n\nThe WHO works to improve nutrition, food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development.\n\nIn April 2019, the WHO released new recommendations stating that children between the ages of two and five should spend no more than one hour per day engaging in sedentary behavior in front of a screen and that children under two should not be permitted any sedentary screen time.\n\nSurgery and trauma care\n\nThe World Health Organization promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries. It has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care, trauma care, and safe surgery. The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.\n\nEmergency work\nThe World Health Organization's primary objective in natural and man-made emergencies is to coordinate with member states and other stakeholders to \"reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability.\"\n\nOn 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of polio was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered \"extraordinary\".\n\nOn 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of Ebola was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious.\n\nReform efforts following the Ebola outbreak\nFollowing the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.\n\nAn internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).  WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016.\n\nThe program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.\n\nResponse to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe WHO created an Incident Management Support Team on 1 January 2020, one day after Chinese health authorities notified the organization of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology. On 5 January the WHO notified all member states of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all countries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China. On 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. The same day, the organization warned of limited human-to-human transmission, and confirmed human-to-human transmission one week later. On 30 January the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), considered a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure for the international community and a pandemic on 11 March.\n\nWhile organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that \"China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data... and they opened up all of their files with the WHO present.\"\n\nThe WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. WHO called the announcement \"regrettable\" and defended its actions in alerting the world to the emergence of COVID-19. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization.\n\nHealth policy\nWHO addresses government health policy with two aims: firstly, \"to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches\" and secondly \"to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health\".\n\nThe organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform health policy options. It oversees the implementation of the International Health Regulations, and publishes a series of medical classifications; of these, three are over-reaching \"reference classifications\": the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. An international convention on pandemic prevention and preparedness is being actively considered.\n\nIn terms of health services, WHO looks to improve \"governance, financing, staffing and management\" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to \"ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies\". WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their reporting about use of research evidence.\n\nDigital Health\nOn Digital Health topics, WHO has existing Inter-Agency collaboration with the International Telecommunication Union (the UN Specialized Agency for ICT), including the Be Health, Be Mobile initiate and the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health.\n\nGovernance and support\nThe remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:\n \"to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda\"; and\n \"to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively\".\n\nPartnerships\nThe WHO along with the World Bank constitute the core team responsible for administering the International Health Partnership (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society, and others committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. Partners work together to put international principles for aid effectiveness and development co-operation into practice in the health sector.\n\nThe organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work, such as the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy, and the WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education & Collaborative Practice.\n\nWHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, targeted at improving health policy and systems.\n\nWHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the HINARI network.\n\nWHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs.\n\nWHO created the Civil Society Reference Group on HIV, which brings together other networks that are involved in policymaking and the dissemination of guidelines.\n\nWHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world.\n\nWHO facilitates technical partnerships through the Technical Advisory Committee on HIV, which they created to develop WHO guidelines and policies.\n\nIn 2014, WHO released the Global Atlas of Palliative Care at the End of Life in a joint publication with the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance, an affiliated NGO working collaboratively with the WHO to promote palliative care in national and international health policy.\n\nPublic health education and action\nEach year, the organization marks World Health Day and other observances focusing on a specific health promotion topic. World Health Day falls on 7 April each year, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding. Recent themes have been vector-borne diseases (2014), healthy ageing (2012) and drug resistance (2011).\n\nThe other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are World Tuberculosis Day, World Immunization Week, World Malaria Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Hepatitis Day, and World AIDS Day.\n\nAs part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.\n\nData handling and publications\nThe World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well-being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries, and the Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE) covering over 50,000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries. The Country Health Intelligence Portal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it.\n\nThe WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national health systems and health workforces. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe.\n\nThe WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS), the WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL), and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) provide guidance for data collection. Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the Health Metrics Network, also aim to provide sufficient high-quality information to assist governmental decision making. WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs, including through the Evidence-Informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009.\n\nOn 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as MiNDbank, went online. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights, and the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being implemented in different countries. It also contains important international documents and information. The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review policies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health.\n\nThe WHO regularly publishes a World Health Report, its leading publication, including an expert assessment of a specific global health topic. Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (overseen by EMRO), the Human Resources for Health (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and the Pan American Journal of Public Health (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).\n\nIn 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic.\n\nThe WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is one of the few mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC. However, there have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national implementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when report indicated 'no'), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff\".\n\nWHO has been moving toward acceptance and integration of traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In 2022, the new International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-11, will attempt to enable classifications from traditional medicine to be integrated with classifications from evidence-based medicine. Though Chinese authorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for traditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific community, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted for traditional remedies. A WHO spokesman said that the inclusion was \"not an endorsement of the scientific validity of any Traditional Medicine practice or the efficacy of any Traditional Medicine intervention.\"\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer \n\nThe WHO sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), conducts and coordinates research into the causes of cancer. It also collects and publishes surveillance data regarding the occurrence of cancer worldwide.\n\nIts Monographs Programme identifies carcinogenic hazards and evaluates environmental causes of cancer in humans.\n\nStructure\nThe World Health Organization is a member of the United Nations Development Group.\n\nMembership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.  and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. The WHO two-year budget for 2022–2023 is paid by its 194 members and 2 associate members. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (or Order of Malta) also attends on an observer basis. The Holy See attends as an observer, and its participation as \"non-Member State Observer\" was formalized by an Assembly resolution in 2021. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since.\n\nWHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization.\n\nThe executive board is composed of members technically qualified in health and gives effect to the decisions and policies of the World Health Assembly. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs.\n\nMembership and participation of the Republic of China\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), which controlled mainland China from 1912 to 1949 and currently governs Taiwan since 1945 following World War II, was the founding member of WHO since its inception had represented \"China\" in the organization, but the representation was changed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1971 that expelled the ROC from both WHO and the UN organs. Since that time, per the One-China policy, both the ROC and PRC lay claim sovereignty to each other's territory.\n\nIn May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power.\n\nPolitical pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly.\n\nIn May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. Later in May 172 members of the United States House of Representatives wrote to the director-general of the World Health Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO.\n\nPressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning the outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political parties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that disease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed concerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-one cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than central government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation.\n\nIn a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. When the video chat was restarted, he was asked another question about Taiwan. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization.\n\nTaiwan's effective response to the 2019–20 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its case for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by a number of experts.  In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have taken similar positions.\n\nOn 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization.\n\nIn November 2020, the word \"Taiwan\" was blocked in comments on a livestream on the WHO's Facebook page.\n\nWorld Health Assembly and Executive Board\n\nThe World Health Assembly (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the executive board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the executive board for three-year terms. The main functions of the board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it, and to facilitate its work. As of May 2021, the chairman of the executive board is Dr. Patrick Amoth of Kenya.\n\nDirector-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The term lasts for five years, and Directors-General are typically appointed in May, when the Assembly meets. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017.\n\nGlobal institutions\nApart from regional, country, and liaison offices, the World Health Assembly has also established other institutions for promoting and carrying on research.\n International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nRegional offices\n\nThe regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to \"establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area\". Many decisions are made at the regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.\n\nEach region has a regional committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not full members. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each region also has a regional office. Each regional office is headed by a director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small. Since 1999, regional directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.\n\nEach regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the regional director, the regional committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the World Health Assembly. The regional committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.\n\nThe regional director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority – concomitantly with the WHO Director-General – of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the region.\n\nEmployees \nThe WHO employs 7,000 people in 149 countries and regions to carry out its principles. In support of the principle of a tobacco-free work environment, the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003.\n\nGoodwill Ambassadors \nThe WHO operates \"Goodwill Ambassadors\"; members of the arts, sports, or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO's initiatives and projects. There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors (Jet Li, Nancy Brinker, Peng Liyuan, Yohei Sasakawa and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra) and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project (Craig David).\n\nOn 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked.\n\nMedical Society of the World Health Organization\nSince the beginning, the WHO has had the  Medical Society of the World Health Organization. It has conducted lectures by noted researchers and published findings, recommendations. The founder, Dr. S. William A. Gunn has been its president. In 1983, Murray Eden was awarded the WHO Medical Society medal, for his work as consultant on research and development for WHO's Director-General.\n\nCountry and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe, Japan. Additional offices include those in Pristina; the West Bank and Gaza; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.\n\nThe country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The WR is member of the UN system country team which is coordinated by the UN System Resident Coordinator.\n\nThe country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.\n\nFinancing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In 2018 the largest contributors ($150+ each) were the United States, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Kingdom, Germany and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\nIn April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. During the first two years of the pandemic, American funding of the WHO declined by a quarter, although it is expected to increase during 2022 and 2023.\n\nOn 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. China paid Biennium 2018–2019, for Assessed contributions US$75,796K, Specified voluntary contributions US$10,184K, Total US$85,980K.\n\n Assessed contributions are the dues the Member States pay depending on the states' wealth and population\n Voluntary contributions specified are funds for specific programme areas provided by the Member States or other partners\n Core voluntary contributions are funds for flexible uses provided by the Member States or other partners\n\nPast \nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the WHO's work involved increasing collaboration with external bodies. , a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. Partners include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). The combined 2012–2013 budget proposed a total expenditure of $3,959 million, of which $944 million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015 million (76%), of which $800 million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa.\n\nWorld headquarters \nThe seat of the organization is in Geneva, Switzerland. It was designed by Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and inaugurated in 1966. In 2017, the organization launched an international competition to redesign and extend its headquarters.\n\nGallery of the WHO Headquarters Building\n\nSee also\n\n Alliance for Healthy Cities, an international alliance\n Global mental health\n Health promotion\n Health Sciences Online, virtual learning resources\n Healthy city\n High 5s Project, a patient safety collaboration\n International Labour Organization\n List of most polluted cities in the world by particulate matter concentration\n Open Learning for Development, virtual learning resources\n The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health\n Timeline of global health\n United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs\n WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality\n WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme\n World Hearing Day\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n WHO Really Calls the Shots,’’ video by the Swiss Government Information Service, 2021\n\nWorld Health Organization\nPublic health\nHealth policy\nUnited Nations organizations based in Geneva\nOrganizations established in 1948\nUnited Nations Development Group\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council\nUnited Nations specialized agencies\nDrug control treaties\nGlobal health\nOrganizations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic\nMedical and health organisations based in Switzerland\n\n The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) works to synchronize the disparate international, national and non-governmental efforts to contest poverty. OCHA seeks to prevent \"confusion\" in relief operations and to ensure that the humanitarian response to disaster situations has greater accountability and predictability. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\n The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. With more than 100,000 troops and personnel deployed, UN peacekeepers make up the second largest deployed military presence in the world. UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN.\n\nOne of the ways the UN promotes social justice is through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were set in September 2000 as a global effort to establish benchmarks for social, economic, and environmental development. These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. By advocating for the SDGs, the UN aims to address global health challenges and improve the overall well-being of individuals and communities worldwide.\n\nThe UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. Through partnerships with various charitable and governmental organizations, the UN supports initiatives such as training local surgical teams and establishing specialty surgical hospitals. These efforts aim to provide access to essential surgical and medical services, target specific diseases, and improve healthcare systems in different regions. One example of a successful partnership is documented in Mongolia, where a concentrated surgical training program led to a countrywide transition from open cholecystectomy to laparoscopic cholecystectomy over a span of nine years.\n\nIn summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all.\n\n United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Pakistan joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947, despite opposition from Afghanistan because of the Durand Line issue. The Pakistan Armed Forces are the third largest contributor of troops towards UN peacekeeping efforts, behind India and Ethiopia. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. UN peacekeepers &mdash; usually military officers and regular troops alongside civilian personnel from many countries &mdash; monitor and observe peace processes that emerge in regions post-war and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations.\n\nQuestion: what countries do the united nations help?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He would be spotted by his school teacher Bruno Botelho, who invited him to play for local club Despertar on the outskirts of Lisbon. He quickly stood out, subsequently catching the eye of Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP and joining the latter's youth system at the age of 10. During his scouting process, as he returned home from school, Mendes realised he was being followed by a man. For fear of being robbed, he ran home, located in a very poor neighbourhood; the \"stalker\" was actually a Sporting scout, who later convinced him to sign. He spent the next four years making a two-hour round trip in order to train every night with his teacher, before moving to Sporting's academy at the age of 14. Mendes initially played as an attacking midfielder before being converted to a left-back, a position he struggled with in the beginning.\n\n After an interview with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, Cicinho signed for Real Madrid on 23 August 2005, effective from the new year. He joined for an undisclosed fee and accompanied compatriots Ronaldo, Robinho, Júlio Baptista and Roberto Carlos, under Brazilian manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo. He made his debut in La Liga on 8 January 2006, replacing the injured Ronaldo after 33 minutes in a goalless draw at Villarreal, and three weeks later, he scored his first goal to open a 2–1 win at Celta de Vigo. On 14 February, he scored after 57 seconds in a 4–0 win over Real Zaragoza in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, to no avail due \n\n The 2002 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira was the 24th edition of the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, the annual Portuguese football season-opening match contested by the winners of the previous season's top league and cup competitions (or cup runner-up in case the league- and cup-winning club is the same).

In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the Democratic-Republican Party led by former American minister to France Thomas Jefferson favored revolutionary France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. George Washington and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed neutrality instead. Under President John Adams, a Federalist, an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799, often called the \"Quasi War\". Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. However, the two entered negotiations over the Louisiana Territory and agreed to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States.\n\n never fully trusted Jackson, a frontiersman and popular war hero, but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams's anti-states' rights policies. Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate, and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush. Calhoun thus became the second of two vice presidents to serve under two different presidents. The only other man who accomplished this feat was George Clinton, who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. During the election, Jackson's aide James Alexander Hamilton attempted a rapprochement between Jackson and Crawford, whom Jackson resented owing partially to \n\n expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams. Calhoun also opposed President Adams' plan to send a delegation to observe a meeting of South and Central American leaders in Panama, believing that the United States should stay out of foreign affairs. Calhoun became disillusioned with Adams' high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of \"internal improvements\", which he now saw as a threat to the rights of the states. Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4, 1826, informing him that he would support Jackson's second campaign for the presidency in 1828. The two were never particularly close friends. \n\n Vice President John Adams, a member of the Federalist Party, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 presidential election and sought to continue Washington's policy of neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars. After Adams took office, France refused to meet with American envoys and began attacking American ships. In 1797, Marshall accepted appointment to a three-member commission to France that also included Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. The three envoys arrived in France in October 1797, but were granted only a fifteen-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After that meeting, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents who refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless \n\n  The presidency of John Adams, began on March 4, 1797, when John Adams was inaugurated as the second president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1801.

The only member of the Federalist Party to ever serve as president, his presidency ended after a single term following his defeat in the 1800 presidential election.

The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn. In 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought \n\n Greek and Roman periods, including one (modern Alaşehir) mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead \n\n Pennsylvania was established in 1681 by a grant of 40,000 square miles to William Penn for services rendered to the crown by his father, Admiral Penn. Penn, a devout member of the Society of Friends, was impelled by desire to provide a safe home for persecuted Quakers. Penn was far in advance of his time in his views of the capacity of mankind for democratic government, and equally so in his broad-minded toleration of differences of religious belief. Penn's Quaker beliefs helped an attitude of toleration toward all Christian denominations spread among the population of Pennsylvania and into the colony's laws. The first Constitution of Pennsylvania adopted by the freeholders established religious liberty, but was not accepted by the Privy Council. The Frame of Government of 1701 guaranteed liberty of conscience to all who confessed and acknowledged \"one Almighty God\", and made eligible for office all who believed in \"Jesus Christ the Savior of the World.\"\n\n The name is an ironic commentary of the immigrant residents in the 18th and 19th centuries who had been dazzled by promotional promises of the supposed wonders of the land they were buying, reflecting their later relative disappointment. Promised Land State Park was once the hunting grounds of the Lenape Indian tribe. Their land was part of the Province of Pennsylvania, established by King Charles II of England and under the leadership of William Penn. William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a colony where religious freedom was foundation of its establishment. The Shakers, a religious sect, from England migrated to the Thirteen Colonies and purchased some of the land \n\n granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love,\" derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός adelphós (brother, brotherly).

He is modeled after the Hatter from Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a character often called the \"Mad Hatter\" in adaptations of Carroll. Mad Hatter is depicted as a scientist who invents and uses technological mind control devices to influence and manipulate the minds of his victims. He is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery. The Mad Hatter has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. He has been voiced by Roddy McDowall in the DC animated universe, and Peter MacNicol in the Batman: Arkham video game series. He has also been portrayed in live-action by David Wayne in the 1960s Batman series, and Benedict Samuel in the Fox series Gotham.

Television and based on characters from the Batman mythos in comic books published by DC Comics. The series originally aired on Fox from September 22, 2014, to April 25, 2019, over five seasons, comprising a total of 100 episodes. It features an ensemble cast that includes Ben McKenzie as James Gordon, Donal Logue as Harvey Bullock, and David Mazouz as Bruce Wayne. The show follows Gordon's early days at the Gotham City Police Department following the murder of Bruce's parents, as well as the origin stories of Batman's infamous rogues gallery. Development for a prequel series based on Batman began in September 2013, with Bruno Heller hired by Fox to serve as a writer and executive producer. In March 2014, Fox originally ordered 16 episodes for its first season before expanding it to 22. Filming primarily took place across New York City.

By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted to see if he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which \n\n induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which, in 1919, he called the \"hydrogen atom\" but, in 1920, he more accurately named the proton. Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1919. Under his leadership the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932 and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton. After his death in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey near Sir Isaac Newton. The chemical element rutherfordium (element 104) was named after him in 1997.\n\n particles. The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon \n\n megaelectronvolts, and Frisch observed this. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \"fission\". Hahn was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery. The discovery came after forty years of investigation into the nature and properties of radioactivity and radioactive substances. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and \n\n All consideration of nuclear electrons ended with James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an element's atomic number Z was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei.\n\nQuestion: what did james chadwick invent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and settled the issue of the western territories, which the states ceded to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s. However, the national government had no money either to pay the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even the repetition of internal revolts such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts. They \n\n The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. Before the 1760s, Britain's American colonies had enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were locally governed by colonial legislatures.

The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the proposed new government. The new administration under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. James Madison spearheaded Congressional amendments to the Constitution as assurances to those cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution. Rhode Island was the final state to ratify the Constitution in 1790, the first ten amendments were ratified in 1791 and became known as the United States Bill of Rights.\n\n The American Revolution established the United States with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments. The United States has the world's oldest written constitution, and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the US Constitution, often word-for-word in places. It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era.  Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war. While many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some, yet denying it to others, the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition \n\n adopted the United States Constitution, replacing the weak Confederation by establishing a comparatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives.

Shortly after a Bill of Rights was ratified as the first ten amendments, guaranteeing fundamental rights used as justification for the revolution.

Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs. This new method focused on understanding the target of the drug rather than simply using trial-and-error. Her work led to the creation of the AIDS drug AZT. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used to fight rejection in organ transplants, and the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), used in the treatment of herpes infection.\n\nEarly life and education\nElion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918, to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish Jewish immigrant. Her family lost their wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Elion was an excellent student who graduated from Walton High School at the age of 15. When she was 15, her grandfather died of stomach cancer, and being with him during his last moments inspired Elion to pursue a career in science and medicine in college. She was Phi Beta Kappa at Hunter College, which she was able to attend for free due to her grades, graduating summa cum laude in 1937 with a degree in chemistry. Unable to find a paying research job after graduating because she was female, Elion worked as a secretary and high school teacher before working in an unpaid position at a chemistry lab. Eventually, she saved up enough money to attend New York University and she earned her M.Sc. in 1941, while working as a high school teacher during the day. In an interview after receiving her Nobel Prize, she stated that she believed the sole reason she was able to further her education as a young female was because she was able to attend Hunter College for free. Her fifteen financial aid applications for graduate school were turned down due to gender bias, so she enrolled in a secretarial school, where she attended only six weeks before she found a job.\n\nUnable to obtain a graduate research position, she worked as a food quality supervisor at A&P supermarkets and for a food lab in New York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going into mayonnaise. She moved to a position at Johnson & Johnson that she hoped would be more promising, but ultimately involved testing the strength of sutures. In 1944, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company (now GlaxoSmithKline) in Tuckahoe, New York. Hitchings was using a new way of developing drugs, by intentionally imitating natural compounds instead of through trial and error. Specifically, she was interested in synthesizing antagonists to nucleic acid derivatives, with the goal that these antagonists would integrate into biological pathways. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for their growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells.Elion synthesized anti-metabolites of purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti-cancer drugs tioguanine and mercaptopurine.\n\nShe pursued graduate studies at night school at New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute), but after several years of long-range commuting, she was informed that she would no longer be able to continue her doctorate on a part-time basis, but would need to give up her job and go to school full-time. Elion made a critical decision in her life, and stayed with her job and give up the pursuit of her doctorate. She never obtained a formal Ph.D., but was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic University of New York) in 1989 and an honorary S.D. degree from Harvard University in 1998.\n\nPersonal life \nSoon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at City College of New York (CCNY).  They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill.  On June 25, 1941, he died from bacterial endocarditis, an infection of his heart valves. In her Nobel interview, she stated that this furthered her drive to become a research scientist and pharmacologist.\n\nElion never married or had children. However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel, opera and ballet, and listening to music. After Burroughs Wellcome moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, Elion moved to nearby Chapel Hill. She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. She continued to make important scientific contributions after her retirement. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science.\n\nGertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81.\n\nCareer and research \nWhile Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research, and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She officially retired from Burroughs and Wellcome in 1983.\n\nShe was affiliated with Duke University as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1971 to 1983 and Research Professor from 1983 to 1999. During her time at Duke, she focused on mentoring medical and graduate students. She published more than 25 papers with the students she mentored at Duke.\n\nEven after her retirement from Burroughs Wellcome, Gertrude continued almost full time work at the lab. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999.\n\nRather than relying on trial-and-error, Elion and Hitchings discovered new drugs using rational drug design, which used the differences in biochemistry and metabolism between normal human cells and pathogens (disease-causing agents such as cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) to design drugs that could kill or inhibit the reproduction of particular pathogens without harming human cells. The drugs they developed are used to treat a variety of maladies, such as leukemia, malaria, lupus, hepatitis, arthritis, gout, organ transplant rejection (azathioprine), as well as herpes (acyclovir, which was the first selective and effective drug of its kind). Most of Elion's early work came from the use and development of purine derivatives.\nElion's research contributed to the development of:\n\n Mercaptopurine (Purinethol), the first treatment for leukemia, also used in organ transplantation.\n Azathioprine (Imuran), the first immuno-suppressive agent, used for organ transplants.\n Allopurinol (Zyloprim), for gout.\n Pyrimethamine (Daraprim), for malaria.\n Trimethoprim (Proloprim, Monoprim, others), for meningitis, sepsis, and bacterial infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts.\n Acyclovir (Zovirax), for viral herpes.\n Nelarabine for cancer treatment.\n\nSelected works by Gertrude B. Elion \n\n \n “Interaction of Anticancer Drugs with Enzymes.” In Pharmacological Basis of Cancer Chemotherapy (1975).\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 1988 Elion received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Hitchings and Sir James Black for discoveries of \"important new principles of drug treatment\". Elion was the fifth female Nobel laureate in Medicine and the ninth in science in general, and one of only a handful of laureates without a doctoral degree. She was the only woman honored with a Nobel Prize that year. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, \na member of the Institute of Medicine in 1991 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences also in 1991.\n\nHer awards include the Garvan-Olin Medal (1968),  the Sloan-Kettering Institute Judd Award (1983), the American Chemical Society Distinguished Chemist Award (1985), the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award (1989), the American Association of Cancer Research Cain Award (1985), the American Cancer Society Medal of Honor (1990), the National Medal of Science (1991), and the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award (1997). In 1991 Elion became the first woman to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame also in 1991. In 1992, she was elected to the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995.\n\nSee also\n Timeline of women in science\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \nNobel Prize Women in Science by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\nMary Ellen Avery Gertrude Elion National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoirs, VOLUME 78, 2000 BY NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS WASHINGTON, D.C \nRoyal Society biographical memoir, Volume 54 in 2008.\n\nExternal links\n\n1918 births\n1999 deaths\nNobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine\nWomen Nobel laureates\nAmerican Nobel laureates\nAmerican women biochemists\nAmerican pharmacologists\nWomen pharmacologists\nAmerican people of Polish-Jewish descent\nAmerican people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent\nAmerican women biologists\nWomen inventors\nJewish American scientists\nJewish women scientists\nFellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nMembers of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nMembers of the National Academy of Medicine\nNational Medal of Science laureates\nRecipients of the Garvan–Olin Medal\nAmerican women chemists\nForeign Members of the Royal Society\nDuke University faculty\nLemelson–MIT Prize\nHunter College alumni\nPolytechnic Institute of New York University alumni\nJewish chemists\n20th-century American chemists\n20th-century American inventors\n20th-century American women scientists\nScientists from the Bronx\n\nGertrude \"Trudy\" Belle Elion (January 23, 1918 – February 21, 1999) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist, who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George H.

Commander Richard Curgenven succeeded Brown in April 1781, and in December that year command passed to Commander Charles Dixon. Dixon took Drake back to England, where she was refitted between April and June 1782 for the sum of £1,595 5s 4d. She then returned to the West Indies. In early March 1783, Captain James King of the frigate fell in with the frigates  (under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson) and, and the brigs Drake and Barrington (or Admiral Barrington). From here on accounts diverge. King decided, on the basis of the information he had \n\n On 15 December 1577 the English pirate Francis Drake set sail from Plymouth to raid Spanish treasure ships and settlements in the Americas. Drake had investors in the voyage in the hope that they could make a profit from the plunder that the English would capture. After nearly three years at sea Drake in the Golden Hinde returned to England in 26 September 1580 and had accomplished the feat of circumnavigating the globe. The investors had made huge profits from the voyage, and there was a desire to launch more expeditions in the same manner. Drake was subsequently knighted by Queen Elizabeth I. After Drake's voyage, the Spanish felt vulnerable \n\n Sir Francis Drake had been defeated in 1595 and the report alarmed Elizabeth I that she wanted to avenge or 'dirten' the defeat. Queen Elizabeth almost immediately sent a new expedition led by the third Earl of Cumberland, Sir George Clifford, so that he could seize San Juan and hold as long as possible. Merely three years after Drake's attack, Cumberland arrived off Dominica with his 600-ton flagship Malice Scourge captained by John Watts, plus the 400-ton vice-flagships Merchant Royal of Sir John Berkeley and Ascension, the 400-ton merchantman Alcedo, and Prosperous, 300-ton Centurion of Henry Palmer, Consent, and Sampson of Henry Clifford; 250-ton galleon Constance of Hercules Fulham; 210-ton Guyana, 200-ton Margaret and John; 190-ton Royal Defence; 120-ton  Affection of William Fleming, and Anthony 80-ton Pegasus the frigate Discovery, the pinnace Scout, the bark Ley; plus two unnamed barks. In total the fleet consisted of 1,700 men and twenty ships. After refreshing his fleet for nearly a week, the Earl transferred to the Virgin Islands on 11 June and celebrated a final muster three days later before laying in a course for San Juan.\n\n War had already been declared by Phillip II after the Treaty of Nonsuch, so the Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish colonies in a kind of preemptive strike. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. He first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. He then plundered Santiago in the Cape Verde islands after which the fleet then sailed across the Atlantic, sacked the port of Santo Domingo, and captured the city of Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia. At Cartagena, Drake released one hundred Turks who were enslaved. On 6 June 1586, during the return leg of the voyage, he raided the Spanish fort of San Agustín in Spanish Florida. After the raids he then went on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's settlement much further north at Roanoke which he replenished and also took back with him all of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists. He finally reached England on 22 July, when he sailed into Portsmouth, England to a hero's welcome.\n\n On March 23, 1573, Le Testu unexpectedly encountered Sir Francis Drake near \"Cabo de Cativas\", near Cativá, Panama. Le Testu was in command of the 80-ton warship Havre (or the New Haven) with a crew of seventy; although it is unknown what Le Testu's mission was, he may have been there at the behest of an Italian sponsor. He reportedly presented to Drake a scimitar, formerly belonging to the condottiero Piero Strozzi, as a gift on behalf of Coligny. It was during this meeting, having brought news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, that he offered to join Drake in a final raid against a Spanish mule train en route to Nombre de Dios before leaving the area.

The film stars George Clooney (who also co-produced), Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell, Dominic West, Caitríona Balfe, and Giancarlo Esposito. It follows financial television host Lee Gates and his producer Patty Fenn, who are put in an extreme situation when an irate investor takes them and their crew as hostage. Money Monster had its world premiere at the 69th Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2016 and was theatrically released in the United States on May 13, 2016, by Sony Pictures Releasing. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing over $93 million.\n\n The film was based on a novel by Alice Duer Miller which was bought by MGM in October 1937. The book was published in February 1938, The New York Times calling it \"an exciting story of manslaughter\". In November 1939 MGM announced that Maureen O'Sullivan would star, Frederick Stephani would produce and Kathryn Scola was writing the screenplay. Virginia Bruce was cast in January 1940. In February Laraine Day replaced Maureen O'Sullivan and Bob Cummings and Billie Burke joined the cast. Filming took place from February to March 1940.\n\n In June 2010, Heigl starred in the Lionsgate comedy-thriller Killers, with Ashton Kutcher. She next starred in and produced the big-screen drama Life As We Know It, directed by Greg Berlanti, which revolved around a woman and a man whose respective best friends die in a car accident. Following the deaths, they begin to share in caring for their late friends' orphaned daughter. Heigl received $12 million for both films. In 2011, Heigl appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy New Year's Eve, directed by Garry Marshall. Despite being a commercial success, grossing over $142 million worldwide, the film received generally negative reviews. Heigl next had the lead role in One for the Money (2012).

Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the international lingua franca in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into the Romance languages and Ancient Greek into Modern Greek and its dialects. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of Latin and Greek is notable. Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world. Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued \n\n Oscan language and script as part of their identity, and employed it in clear opposition to Rome, for example in coinage during the Social War (91–87 BCE). The Veneti, though steadfast allies of the Romans for centuries, retained their own alphabet until the end of the Roman Republic (27 BCE). According to Lomas (2004), the crucial factor in Latinising these remaining groups that resisted full integration was granting them Roman citizenship (most notably by the Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis et Sociis Danda in 90 BCE), thereby leading them to participate in Roman–Latin society and gradually abandon their Italic, Etruscan, Celtic etc. cultural independence.\n\n By the end of the first century AD the Romans had conquered the entire Mediterranean Basin and established hundreds of colonies in the conquered provinces. Over time this—along with other factors that encouraged linguistic and cultural assimilation, such as political unity, frequent travel and commerce, military service, etc.—made Latin the predominant language throughout the western Mediterranean. Latin itself was subject to the same assimilatory tendencies, such that its varieties had probably become more uniform by the time the Western Empire fell in 476 than they had been before it. That is not to say that the language had been static for all those years, but rather that ongoing changes tended to spread to all regions. All of these homogenizing factors were \n\n be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire. The modern Romance languages (Catalan, French, Italian, Portuguese, Roumanian, Spanish) all derive from Latin. Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture. The legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages. The Roman empire was taken as a model by later European empires, such as the Spanish and British empires. Classical art has been taken as a model in later periods – medieval Romanesque architecture and Enlightenment-era neoclassical literature were both influenced by classical models, to take but two examples, while James Joyce's Ulysses is one of the most influential works of twentieth-century literature.\n\n Roman names were adopted by some, and the Latin language was spread, which was greatly facilitated by the fact that many cultures were mostly oral (particularly for the Gauls and Iberians). Anyone who wanted to deal (through writing) with the bureaucracy and/or with the Roman market had to write in Latin. The extent of the adoption is subject to ongoing debate, as the native languages were certainly spoken after the conquests. Moreover, in the eastern half of the Empire, Latin had to compete with Greek, which largely kept its position as lingua franca and even spread to new areas. Latin became prominent in certain areas around new veteran \n\nQuestion: what did the ancient romans speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When Lennon presented the composition to his bandmates, his songwriting partner Paul McCartney noticed its similarity to \"You Can't Catch Me\" and recommended they slow it in tempo to reduce the resemblance. Beatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\". In a December 1987 interview by Selina Scott on the television show West 57th Street, George Harrison stated that he wrote two lines of the song.\n\n Apple Records, the Beatles' EMI-distributed record label, released Abbey Road on 26 September 1969, with \"Come Together\" sequenced as the opening track. The song was issued as a double A-side single with Harrison's \"Something\" on 6 October in America (as Apple 2654) and 31 October in Britain (as Apple R5814). Commercially, the single was a massive success, staying on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for 16 weeks, and reaching No. 1. The single was released on 31 October 1969 in the UK and reached No. 4. The first take of the song, recorded on 21 July 1969, with slightly different lyrics, was released in 1996 on the outtake compilation Anthology 3, and take five of the song was released on the Abbey Road 50th Anniversary release. In May 2021, Ringo Starr said it was his favourite Beatles song in an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\n In March 1973, following the completion of his album Living in the Material World, Harrison offered \"Sunshine Life for Me\" to Starr for inclusion on the latter's first rock solo album, Ringo. The main sessions for Ringo took place in Los Angeles that same month and coincided with a spirit of reconciliation among all the former Beatles, after Harrison, Starr and Lennon had grown disaffected with Klein as a manager. In addition to \"Sunshine Life for Me\" and individual contributions from Lennon and McCartney, Starr received co-writing assistance from Harrison on \"Photograph\", which became Starr's first number 1 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart when released as the album's advance single. With Richard Perry as his producer, Starr recorded \n\n Apple Records issued Ringo on 2 November 1973. The release coincided with Lennon, Harrison and Starr suing Klein in the High Court for payment of funds owed to the Beatles and for misrepresenting their interests. \"Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)\" was sequenced as the fourth track on the album, between \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". In his book The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, Bruce Spizer describes the first five tracks on Ringo as \"one of the strongest album sides produced by any ex-Beatle\". The album cover consisted of a painting by Tim Bruckner in which Harrison, the four members of the Band and all the other musicians on the recording \n\n \"You and Me (Babe)\" is a song by English musician Ringo Starr, released as the final track on his 1973 album Ringo. Starr's fellow ex-Beatle George Harrison wrote the song along with Mal Evans, the Beatles' longtime aide and a personal assistant to Starr during the making of Ringo. The track serves as a farewell from Starr to his audience in the manner of a show-closing finale, by lyrically referring to the completion of the album. During the extended fadeout, Starr delivers a spoken message in which he thanks the musicians and studio personnel who helped with the recording of Ringo – among them, Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and his producer, Richard Perry. The recording of \"You and Me (Babe)\" features a series of well-regarded guitar solos from Harrison, and backing from musicians such as Nicky Hopkins and Klaus Voormann. Jack Nitzsche and Tom Scott contributed the song's musical arrangements.\n\nQuestion: what does ringo sing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lucy was accused by her son, Eutropius (or Euprepius), of being a Christian. She was brought before Diocletian, who at first attempted to dissuade her and then placed her in a cauldron of burning pitch; Lucy lived for three days in the cauldron. When Diocletian heard that she was still alive, he ordered her to be carried around the city, with weights loaded on her body. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. A priest named Protasius helped him with his request. 75 people were converted to Christianity by the example of Geminian. The judge presiding at their trial was thrown from his horse on a stone bridge; his body was never found. Lucy and Geminian were ultimately beheaded. They were buried by a woman named Maxima.\n\nLucy was a perfectly healthy infant until the fall of 2011, when her parents noticed that the shape of her head was changing - a bump, a protrusion was forming in the back of her skull and her forehead was becoming more prominent. A head ultrasound ruled out the worst - brain inflammation and brain tumor - but Lucy's parents remained concerned.\nAfter extensive online research, Lucy's mom, Katie, came across a condition that fit Lucy's symptoms: craniosynostosis, a premature fusion of the cranial sutures between the bones of a baby's skull. Babies are born with incompletely fused skull bones to accommodate brain growth during infancy. Typically, these sutures fuse around 1-2 years of age, but in some children this fusion occurs prematurely. Such early closing can restrict brain growth, lead to developmental anomalies and cause a misshapen skull.\nIn the spring of 2012, the Jenkins family came to Johns Hopkins Children's Center where they met pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. George Jallo and plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Amir Dorafshar.\nEven though craniosynostosis repairs have been done for many years, the Hopkins surgeons used a novel approach that ensured greater accuracy and precision. Before the surgery, Lucy underwent a 3-D head CT scan, which allowed the surgeons to meticulously plan every cut before they even made the first incision.\nThis virtual pre-surgery mapping helps reduce the chance for error and increases the precision and accuracy of execution. Based on the 3-D images, the surgeons also create shaping guides, which they put on the patient's head before the procedure to help them navigate more precisely during the actual operation.\nThis approach is vastly superior to the current technique of simply \"eyeballing\" it, says Dr. Dorafshar. It is particularly useful in infants who are diagnosed later and in whom minimally invasive surgery is no longer an option.\n\"When Dr. Dorafshar talked to us about it, I immediately felt that it was in Lucy's best interest to have it done. Our insurance company initially did not want to authorize it, but I spent quite a bit of time on the phone with them to make sure it would be covered as a special exception,\" Katie says.\nLucy's parents even saw the computer models of Lucy's head along with the planned cuts and reconstruction.\n\"That made us feel very confident in what they were doing, and I knew right then that the surgeons had done their homework,\" Katie adds.\nOn Aug. 8, 2012 Lucy underwent a five-and-a-half-hour surgery. Most of it went very smoothly, but toward the end, Lucy began bleeding heavily and her blood pressure dropped precipitously. She ended up needing four units of blood. Thankfully, the rest of the procedure was uneventful, and Lucy went to the pediatric intensive care unit that day.\nHowever, when Dr. Dorafshar stopped by the PICU that day to check on her, he saw an alarming sign - Lucy's abdomen was so swollen that it was pushing on her lungs causing her to have difficulty breathing. Luckily, she was still on a breathing tube as a precaution coming out of surgery. Lucy had developed abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of the fast infusion of blood during the surgery. To release the penned up fluid from her abdomen, Lucy had to have a minor procedure, which relieved pressure and restored normal breathing.\n\"It was extremely difficult to see our baby looking like that,\" Katie says. \"With her various lines, drains, breathing tube and head wrapped. The only thing I remember about that time was hearing Dr. Dorafshar's voice, and that was all I could focus on. He was so calm and reassuring, and that was exactly what I needed to stay composed and to begin to focus on helping Lucy to recover.\"\nFrom that point on, Lucy grew stronger, acted a little feistier and her bubbly personality started to come back. By the time, she left the hospital, Lucy was sitting up on her own, crawling around her crib, playing, laughing and talking.\nToday, Lucy is perfectly healthy, much to the delight of her parents and surgeons. Lucy loves to visit Hopkins and knows the doctors and staff took excellent care of her; when asked about her doctors, she fondly says \"they fixed my head!\" Lucy no longer needs follow-ups.\n\"I can't say enough about the care Lucy received while she was in the hospital,\" Katie says. \"Lucy's surgery changed my life, and I will always be so thankful for the care Lucy received, in particular from Dr. Dorafshar, Dr. Jallo, Dr. Carson, Dr. Whitaker, Dr. Greenberg, Dr. Abdullah, and all of the attending physicians, PICU nurses and staff. We feel very fortunate that we live so close to Johns Hopkins Children's Center.\"\n\nLearn more about nephrology at Children's Colorado, and how we can help you improve your practice.\nLucy Washburn was a fussy baby. For new parents Cynthia and Brad Washburn, that didn't seem unusual. That's just what kind of baby Lucy was. But when Cynthia noticed at 3 months what looked like a hernia around Lucy's groin, she decided to take her to the pediatrician near their home in Winter Park, Colorado, nestled into the mountains west of Denver at about 9,500 feet.\n\"They drew blood,\" says Brad, \"and it all just exploded from there.\"\nAn hour later, Lucy was in a helicopter rushing to Children's Hospital Colorado while her parents drove down behind.\n\"She had rip-roaring high blood pressure,\" says Chief of Pediatric Nephrology Jens Goebel, MD, who managed her care. \"It took astronomical amounts of blood pressure medications to get it under control.\"\nExcessive protein in her urine prompted an initial diagnosis of congenital nephrotic syndrome, but a genetic test came back unrevealing. Her enlarged kidneys and high blood pressure, for a while, led to speculation she might have polycystic kidney disease. But that genetic test, too, came back negative.\n\"They went through four or five diagnoses,\" says Brad.\n\"And God knows how many genetic tests,\" Cynthia adds. \"They just didn't know what the cause was.\"\nIt was a frightening ordeal, particularly for Cynthia, who, as a teen, had suffered a meningococcal infection that came on suddenly, shut down her major organs and put her in a coma that lasted weeks. It left her with skin grafts all over her body. Doctors were forced to amputate her legs.\n\"My mom flew out from Australia when Lucy was in the hospital,\" Cynthia recalls. \"She was saying, 'it's just like déjà vu.'\"\nLucy's condition stayed distressingly touch-and-go for three months. Her team assigned her the umbrella diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, though they still didn't know exactly what. But once she was stable, they sent her home.\nAnd for more than a year, she did alright — well enough for her team to gradually reduce her meds. Cynthia and Brad settled into the routine of bringing her in for blood work once a month.\nThen, in April of last year, a routine blood test showed Lucy’s platelet count rapidly dropping.\nThat was the clue that pulled it altogether.\n\"It's like a Ferrari someone cut the brakes on. As long as it sits in the garage, it's alright. But if you take that out at 150 mph and you don't have brakes, bad things are going to happen.\"\nDrs. Goebel and Dixon agreed: The most likely culprit was in fact a blood disease, thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA. It results when platelets clump and plug up networks of capillaries — such as those of the kidneys — deforming red blood cells as they squeeze through. Hence the high blood pressure. Hence the anemia. Hence the low platelet count.\nTMA has many causes, from E. coli to cancer. In Lucy's case, Drs. Dixon and Goebel suspected it was atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, the result of a genetic defect in a component of the immune system known as complement.\n\"Certain molecules on the surface of bacteria don't occur on human cells,\" says Dr. Dixon. \"These innate parts of the immune system can recognize danger patterns and go after a pathogen without ever being exposed to it.\"\nComplement destroys the bacterium meningococcus by punching a hole in its cell wall. Its power is immediate and immense. And once it's triggered, it requires a strong regulatory response. In aHUS, that doesn't happen.\n\"Complement is a protein cascade,\" says University of Colorado School of Medicine immunologist Ashley Frazer-Abel, PhD, one of the nation's foremost experts on complement proteins. \"These proteins exist in circulation, and in an activating event like an infection, it's a cycle of self-perpetuation. It's very good locally to fight infection, but when it's systemic or uncontrolled, it's doing direct damage to the body or recruiting other immune cells to perpetuate that damage.\"\n\"It's like a Ferrari someone cut the brakes on,\" says Dr. Dixon. \"As long as it sits in the garage, it's alright. But if you take that out at 150 mph and you don't have brakes, bad things are going to happen.\"\nThat's what was happening to Lucy, and the complement system's sudden spiral led to another 7 weeks in the hospital. Still, with a diagnosis also came the brake Lucy needed: powerful complement-blocking agents that hobble proteins in the chain.\nThat would save her life, but it would also leave her complement system powerless against meningococcal disease — the same infection that had taken Cynthia's legs.\n\"That was a difficult conversation to have,\" says Dr. Dixon. He speculated it was possible that the same underlying defect had caused Cynthia's infection. Perhaps a defective complement system depleted by its own autoimmune attack had left her vulnerable to the infection in the first place.\nThe other downside was that complement-blockers required infusion — a long day for the Washburns, who would have to drive a nearly 150-mile round trip. Drs. Goebel and Dixon already had a patient enrolled in a clinical trial for an experimental, extended release complement-blocking drug, which would only require Lucy to come in monthly. Her condition was so rare that, once she entered the trial, Children's Colorado became one of just two sites in the world with more than one patient enrolled.\nInitially it worked. Lucy's platelet count went up and her blood pressure stabilized. But by the next week, a lab check between infusions caught her platelet count dropping and anemia setting in.\nDrs. Dixon and Goebel, who number among the world's foremost experts in treating TMA in children, considered the possibility that they'd misdiagnosed. Still, they had experience enough to feel confident they'd got it right.\nThey also knew that dosing regimens in clinical trials like the one Lucy was in tend to extrapolate dosing regimens from adults. But young children metabolize some drugs much faster than adults and older children. The half-life is shorter. Their team had studied that phenomenon and published their results. Maybe the experimental drug had just worn off.\nThe real question, they surmised, was whether the complement system was blocked.\nThere was only one real way to find out: an exacting version of a test called CH50. It's the most sensitive measure of complement — and the one most difficult to perform. Because of the difficulty, it can take weeks to get results. Only a handful of labs in the country offer it.\nOne of them belongs to Dr. Frazer-Abel: Exsera BioLabs, just across the street from Children's Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus.\nA few tests measure complement system activity, but none are as sensitive or accurate as CH50. It's also the most difficult to perform, because it involves living cells.\n\"Basically, you take sheep red blood cells and decorate them with antibodies that prime them for killing by complement,\" says Dr. Dixon. \"Then you dump in patient serum and if there's active complement, it will punch holes in these cells. That releases hemoglobin, which is a pigment, so then you measure the color.\"\n\"You can actually see it,\" adds Dr. Frazer-Abel.\nHistorically used to measure complement in the opposite direction — in the case of recurrent bacterial meningitis, say — CH50 has been around for nearly 100 years. But it's not easy to pull off.\n\"Since they're live cells, they're more complex to work with than a purified reagent you just pull off the shelf,\" says Dr. Frazer-Abel. \"It's also more realistic, because our bodies are made of cells. A sheep can get sick. You have to be able to control for that. So it takes a lab that knows what they're doing.\"\nIt's also far from the only complement test Exsera — one of the only labs in the nation dedicated exclusively to complement — performs. There are 56 proteins in the complement system, says Dr. Frazer-Abel. Exsera measures almost all of them.\n\"We're friends with Exsera,\" says Dr. Goebel. \"We can draw blood in the morning and get a result by sunset.\"\nThe result proved what Drs. Dixon and Goebel suspected: complement wasn't blocked. The trial drug wasn't enough to suppress Lucy's complement system through the month, and because the drug was experimental, there was no way to know if they could safely adjust the amount or frequency of the dose.\nThey also knew that a drug already on the market called eculizumab, though it would require more frequent infusions, would do the job.\n\"The recommended dosing of these complement-blocking agents is, in Dr. Dixon's and my experience, not sufficient for children with rare variants of this disease,\" Dr. Goebel says. \"We've seen it repeatedly and often enough that we don't blink anymore when we say we need to treat this child more aggressively.\"\n\"At the end of the day, we pulled her out of the study,\" says Dr. Dixon.\nIt took courage and a sure hand — but it worked. On a high dose of eculizumab every two weeks, Lucy's condition stabilized. A genetic test eventually confirmed the diagnosis. With vaccinations against meningococcus and prophylactic antibiotics, along with several blood pressure medications, Lucy lives the life of a relatively normal 2-year-old.\nIt's not perfect, but it's much better than the alternative. It wasn't so long ago, after all, that aHUS wasn't often diagnosed. Kids went through fruitless kidney transplants, sometimes several, to no avail. For now, Lucy's team is working with a health center near Winter Park to try to move Lucy's bi-weekly infusions closer to home.\nAs it stands, that's the best and only option, perhaps for the rest of Lucy's life.\n\"We've seen it repeatedly and often enough that we don't blink anymore when we say we need to treat this child more aggressively.\"\nBut there's hope the work of complement researchers like Drs. Dixon and Frazer-Abel may change that one day. Currently, they're working with the Molecular Genetics Lab at Children's Colorado to understand the functional consequences of mutations in complement factor H, the group of genes that governs complement's braking system.\n\"That's the final piece we need for our existing arsenal,\" says Dr. Frazer-Abel. \"We're realistically only five or six months out.\"\nStill, it won't be easy, says microbiologist Alisa Gaskell, PhD, Scientific Director of the Molecular Genetics Lab at Children's Colorado. In fact, in many ways, it will require radically revising the standard practice of gene sequencing.\n\"First generation sequencing was akin to reading long stretches of DNA kind of like you read a book,\" she says. \"We've since developed new technologies where they chop the book into single words, then we amplify those words, and a computer program rearranges them back into order and gives a report — basically the Cliff's Notes.\"\nIt's a much faster method. The Human Genome Project took just under 13 years to complete. The current record, completed at The Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego, is 19 hours.\nBut the current method is a problem when analyzing genes like those of complement factor H, which closely resembles five other genes. Sequestering and ferreting out the meaning of tiny changes that lead to protein malfunctions depends on context. The conventional method can't carry that kind of context.\n\"We're looking at it differently,\" says Dr. Gaskell. \"We're saying, 'How can we, within these constraints, leave sort of cookie crumbs that give us clues to the sequence. We're basically breaking with doctrine.\"\nEssentially, Dr. Gaskell and her team are changing the way they break up the DNA, a method that involves overlapping longer strands of code.\nOn the wet lab side, where the DNA is extracted, that means using more mature enzymes that will read a longer stretch of code without error. On the dry lab side, where the DNA is processed, it's writing new algorithms that can not only arrange those stretches, but accurately flag where something might have gone wrong.\n\"It's reengineering both those components in a unified way that will get us to the point where we're only looking at words that come from this gene and nothing else,\" says Dr. Gaskell. \"It will take us a few cycles, but once we get to where we can resolve a sentence, we can start pressing clinical samples through and doing blinded studies that compare what we find to clinical results. Then we'll see if we have a system that works.\"\n\"We have about an acre of property,\" Brad remarks, watching Lucy zip around on a strider. \"She knows every inch of it.\"\nHe and Cynthia, both of whom work as ski instructors for the National Sports Center for the Disabled, plan to take her down the bunny hills in a backpack this year. They'll wait until she's 3 to put her on skis.\n\"She's doing great. She really is,\" says Cynthia. \"She's at home with me four days a week and goes to day care one day. She likes the social part, but I guess we're still a bit terrified of the infection piece. Maybe a little bit further down the track, we could push it to two or three days. But right now one day a week is as much as I can put up with.\"\nIn the meantime, they're taking it one day at a time.\n\"We're stronger just knowing there's a treatment,\" says Cynthia. \"Lucy's team is amazing. We trust them with her life completely.\"\nOur work transforms care for children with complex kidney diseases by leading the national effort to develop and implement practices that lead to the best possible outcomes for our patients.\n\n Saints Lucy and Geminian were venerated on 16 September as saints who died as martyrs in Rome during the persecution of Diocletian in about 290 or 300 or, more precisely, in 304. Veneration for them was ancient but their story is \"only known from fabulous acts.\" Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena.\n\n Lucy Smith was born in Chicago in 1925. Her mother, Viola, died when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \"Little Lucy Smith\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer. In two years she had become a skilled gospel accompanist, \n\nQuestion: where was st. lucy born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats and the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution. At the 2019 election, the third seat has been reintroduced as the Division of Bean. Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor and usually by comfortable margins. The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990 and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one Senate seat each.\n\n The Australian Labor Party (ALP), also simply known as Labor, is the major centre-left political party in Australia, one of two major parties in Australian politics, along with the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia. It has been in Opposition in the federal parliament since the 2013 election. The ALP is a federal party, with political branches in each state and territory. They are currently in government in Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory. The Labor Party is the oldest political party in Australia. The ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the Australian parliament in 1901. Nevertheless, it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by \n\n in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly and were in government during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001. Labor took back control of the Assembly in 2001. At the 2004 election, Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and the Labor Party won 9 of the 17 seats allowing them to form the ACT's first majority government. Since 2008, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens. , the Chief Minister was Andrew Barr from the Australian Labor Party. The Australian federal government retains some influence over \n\n  Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the Government of South Australia as well as the bicameral Parliament of South Australia, which consists of the lower house known as the House of Assembly and the upper house known as the Legislative Council. General elections are held every four years, the last being the 2018 election. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the City of Adelaide. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth. Reflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the South Australian House of Assembly. Of the 47 seats in the chamber, 34 seats (three-quarters of the legislature) are based in Adelaide, and two rural seats include Adelaide suburbs.\n\n The ACT has internal self-government, but Australia's Constitution does not afford a territory legislature the high degree of independence provided to that of a state. Instead, each territory is governed under a Commonwealth statute —for the ACT, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. The chief minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly. Laws are made in a 25-member Legislative Assembly that combines both state and local government functions (prior to 2016, the Assembly was made up of 17 members). Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected via the Hare–Clark system.

It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765).\n\nIts founding by Nathaniel Potter and John Beale Davidge was part of an influx of professionals to Baltimore and the rapid urban development that immediately followed the American Revolution. By the late 1780s, there was public discussion about the need for \"medical reform and suppression of quackery\". A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nDavidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland.\n\nResearch\nResearchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have made several milestone discoveries in the field of biomedical research and therapeutics. Recent discoveries include the development of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer by the lab of Angela Brodie, and the discovery of calcium sparks as drivers of heart contraction by the lab of Jonathan Lederer.\n\nThe School of Medicine is a research-focused academic institution, with $537 million in extramural research funding in 2018. A large portion of that research funding comes from the federal government of the United States. , over $148 million in research grants from the NIH were attributed to the parent university of the School of Medicine. Focus areas of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's research include cancer research, organ transplant research, cardiovascular research, neuroscience, and virology.\n\nThe School of Medicine has extensive operations in research education. Together with the Graduate Program in Life Sciences, the school provides research teaching and oversees the award of Ph.D. degrees across multiple research tracks. The School of Medicine is one of only 50 medical institutions in the United States to offer a Medical Scientist Training Program.\n\nThe School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research:\n\nThe Institute of Human Virology\nThe Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by Robert Gallo, the only recipient of two Lasker Awards for the discovery of the first human retrovirus, and the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS.

Established in 1807 as the College of Medicine of Maryland, it is the first public and the fifth oldest medical school in the United States. UMB SOM's campus includes Davidge Hall, which was built in 1812, and is the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to an  degree, the UMB SOM offers PhD programs through the Graduate Program in Life Sciences. It also offers several joint degree programs: a Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) MD/PhD, a joint MD/DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery), the MD/MPH (Master of Public Health) program, and the PhD/DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy).\n\nThe University of Maryland School of Medicine was ranked 16th in U.S. News and World Reports 2022 rankings of \"Best Medical Schools: Primary Care\", and 27th in \"Best Medical Schools: Research\". , the school offered admission to 6.3% of applicants. Since 2006, the medical school dean has been E. Albert Reece.\n\nHistory\n \n\nChartered as the College of Medicine of Maryland in December 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland and the only public medical school in the U.S. at the time. It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765).\n\nIts founding by Nathaniel Potter and John Beale Davidge was part of an influx of professionals to Baltimore and the rapid urban development that immediately followed the American Revolution. By the late 1780s, there was public discussion about the need for \"medical reform and suppression of quackery\". A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nDavidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland.\n\nResearch\nResearchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have made several milestone discoveries in the field of biomedical research and therapeutics. Recent discoveries include the development of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer by the lab of Angela Brodie, and the discovery of calcium sparks as drivers of heart contraction by the lab of Jonathan Lederer.\n\nThe School of Medicine is a research-focused academic institution, with $537 million in extramural research funding in 2018. A large portion of that research funding comes from the federal government of the United States. , over $148 million in research grants from the NIH were attributed to the parent university of the School of Medicine. Focus areas of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's research include cancer research, organ transplant research, cardiovascular research, neuroscience, and virology.\n\nThe School of Medicine has extensive operations in research education. Together with the Graduate Program in Life Sciences, the school provides research teaching and oversees the award of Ph.D. degrees across multiple research tracks. The School of Medicine is one of only 50 medical institutions in the United States to offer a Medical Scientist Training Program.\n\nThe School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research:\n\nThe Institute of Human Virology\nThe Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by Robert Gallo, the only recipient of two Lasker Awards for the discovery of the first human retrovirus, and the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS. IHV operates in a dedicated building on the UMSOM campus next to the University of Maryland Medical Center as a partnership between the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the University System of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System.\n\nThe Institute for Genome Sciences\nLaunched in 2007, the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) is a genomics research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  IGS investigators use genomic and bioinformatic tools to research genome function in health and diseases and work in interdisciplinary collaborations with biomedical investigators. IGS is led by Dr. Claire M. Fraser-Liggett. Research areas include: Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics, Functional Genomics, Human Genetic Variation, Infectious Diseases, Organismal Diversity and Evolution, Human Microbiome Project, Plant Genomics, and Microbial Community Ecology. Investigators at IGS work on Disease Ontology research, the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) for HMP, and other grants. IGS is one of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases (GSCID) centers designated by NIAID.\n\nThe Institute for Global Health\nThe Institute for Global Health (IGH) was established in 2015. The IGH develops new and improved ways of diagnosing, preventing, treating, controlling and eradicating diseases of global impact. Such diseases include malaria, Ebola and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases such as measles. The IGH includes the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) and the Division of Malaria Research.\n\nMaryland Psychiatric Research Center\nThe MPRC was established on the grounds of Spring Grove Hospital as a result of public interest in the research pioneered there on the use of the psychedelic compound LSD in Schizophrenia research. The first of this series of experiments, which came to be known as the Spring Grove Experiment, began in 1955 in cottage 13 of the hospital grounds. The study was largely conducted by the members of the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, and became the largest study on psychedelic drugs in psychiatric research.  After the study gained media publicity, research funding was made available and a new building was constructed on the north side of the hospital grounds to house MPRC, a division of the department of Psychiatry of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Currently, MPRC hosts over 20 clinical and basic research faculty that form its core research program into psychiatric disease. MPRC is also the editorial seat for the Schizophrenia Bulletin, a peer-reviewed medical journal dedicated to schizophrenia research.\n\nDepartments\n\nClinical\n Anesthesiology \n Dermatology \n Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine \n Emergency Medicine \n Epidemiology and Public Health \n Family and Community Medicine \n Medicine \n Neurology \n Neurosurgery \n Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences  \n Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences \n Orthopaedics \n Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery \n Pathology\n Pediatrics \n Psychiatry \n Radiation Oncology \n Surgery\n\nBasic Research\n Anatomy and Neurobiology \n Biochemistry and Molecular Biology \n Microbiology and Immunology \n Pharmacology \n Physiology\n\nAllied Health\n The Department of Medical and Research Technology (DMRT) offers a graduate program and a categorical certificate program and the School of Medicine's only undergraduate program.

Galileo has been called the \"father\" of observational astronomy, modern physics, the scientific method, and modern science. Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and \"hydrostatic balances\". He invented the thermoscope and various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, observation of Saturn's rings, and analysis of sunspots. Galileo's championing of Copernican \n\n Jupiter's disc, the strange appearances of Saturn, as well as of the stars of the Milky Way. With a Fontana's telescope, the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupi observed for the first time in 1630 the horizontal bands on the atmosphere of Jupiter and in 1639 the phases of Mercury, an evidence, together with the phases of Venus observed by Galileo in 1610, that the Copernicus's heliocentric theory was correct. In 1645, he claimed to have observed a satellite of Venus (Paul Stroobant demonstrated in 1887 that all similar observations were not related to a putative satellite of Venus). He died of plague in Naples with the whole family in July 1656. The lunar crater Fontana and the crater Fontana on Mars are named in his honor. Note: See Donato Creti for paintings of planets from the next century.\n\n On 30 November 1609, Galileo aimed his telescope at the Moon. While not being the first person to observe the Moon through a telescope (English mathematician Thomas Harriot had done it four months before but only saw a \"strange spottednesse\"), Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The Moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first \"planet\", an \"eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian\", as put forth by Dante. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632, although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before. A friend of Galileo's, the painter Cigoli, included a realistic depiction of the Moon in one of his paintings, though probably used his own telescope to make the observation.\n\n With the help of the telescope providing a closer look into the sky, Galileo Galilei proved the heliocentric model of the Solar System. Galileo observed the phases of Venus's appearance with the telescope and was able to confirm Kepler's first law of planetary motion and Copernicus's heliocentric model. Galileo claimed that the Solar System is not only made up of the Sun, the Moon and the planets but also comets. By observing movements around Jupiter, Galileo initially thought that these were the actions of stars. However, after a week of observing, he noticed changes in the patterns of motion in which he concluded that they are moons, four moons.\n\n Galileo Galilei publishes Sidereus Nuncius describing the findings of his observations with the telescope he built. These include spots on the Sun, craters on the Moon, and four satellites of Jupiter. Proving that not everything orbits Earth, he promotes the Copernican view of a Sun-centered universe.\n\nQuestion: what objects did galileo see with his telescope?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is one of a series of seven paintings created for the 1956 film Seven Wonders of the World, each depicting one of the eponymous wonders. The painting shows the Colossus of Rhodes, the ancient statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun, Helios. It was ultimately not used for the movie, and in 1981 was donated to the Kunstmuseum Bern, its present location. Painted two decades after Dalí's heyday with the surrealist movement, The Colossus of Rhodes is emblematic of his shift from the avant-garde to the \n\n The Sacrament of the Last Supper was completed during Dalí's post-World War II period, which is characterized by his increased interest in science, optical illusion and religion. During this time he became a devout Roman Catholic and simultaneously was astonished by the \"atomic age\". Dalí himself labelled this era in his work \"Nuclear Mysticism\". He sought to combine traditional Christian iconography with images of disintegration. This is especially apparent in his piece The Madonna of Port Lligat, which was completed six years earlier. The painting was not commissioned. After purchasing the Crucifixion and then giving it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, collector and banker \n\n Dalí's most recognised works date from before 1940, when he was preoccupied with the subconscious and the nature of perception. The Persistence of Memory, the work with which he is most identified, was painted in 1931, and represented a decade that saw Dalí firmly within the avant-garde. His move to the United States in 1940 caused financial pressures, but brought to the fore his flair for showmanship, helping to develop his relationship with Hollywood. At the end of World War II, a focus on the historical, scientific, and religious was introduced into Dalí's work. The Colossus of Rhodes exemplifies Dalí's preoccupations \n\n During the 1940s and 1950s Dalí's interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with nuclear science, feeling that \"thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought\". The atomic bombing at the end of World War II left a lasting impression; his 1951 essay \"Mystical Manifesto\" introduced an art theory he called \"nuclear mysticism\" that combined his interests in Catholicism, mathematics, science, and Catalan culture in an effort to reestablish classical values and techniques, which he extensively utilized in Corpus Hypercubus. That same year, to promote nuclear mysticism and explain the \"return to spiritual classicism movement\" in modern art, he traveled throughout the United States giving lectures. Before painting Corpus Hypercubus, Dalí announced his intention to portray an exploding Christ using both classical painting techniques along with the motif of the cube, and he declared that \"this painting will be the great metaphysical work of [his] summer\". Juan de Herrera's Treatise on Cubic Forms was particularly influential to Dalí.\n\n Antoni Pitxot (Figueres, Girona, January 5, 1934 – June 12, 2015) was a Spanish Catalan painter and a longtime friend and collaborator of Salvador Dalí. Pitxot was born into a family with many artists in its ranks, among them, his uncle Ramon Pichot. He began studying drawing at the age of thirteen, and he exhibited regularly in Lisbon, Bilbao, Barcelona, and Madrid in his twenties and thirties, winning many prizes, including the Gold Medal painting prize in Barcelona's La Punyalada competition in 1965. At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family's property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea \n\nQuestion: where did salvador dali study art?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A spot of delicate color or the scent of a living plant can boost my mood incredibly, and it’s not just me. Apparently, patients who are exposed to flowers during surgery recovery heal more quickly and are generally more optimistic. And of course, the emotional and psychic impact of flowers is far from the only benefit they hold from us. Both western and Eastern medical traditions have long utilized flowers as solutions for physical complaints.\nSome healing flowers may be immediately familiar to you: Herbs such as chamomile, echinacea, calendula and St. John’s Wort are commonly known to Western herbalists. Others, like hawthorn, yarrow, meadowsweet and lavender, may be recognizable for other reasons. I certainly never considered lavender as more than a pretty, soporific flower before I started at The Herb Companion. Hawthorn was just a kind of tree, and one I wouldn’t be able to recognize on sight at that.\nThe lotus flower is one of the most iconic images of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nLotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is perhaps one of the best-recognized flowers used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Eight separate parts of the lotus flower are used for a variety of ailments, especially those relating to fevers, irritability and bleeding.\nThere are more than 30 species of chrysanthemum in the world, and only a few are fit to be used medicinally. Medicinal varieties are most often recommended to treat symptoms of the common cold such as fever, headache, and dry or irritated eyes. TCM practitioners also combine chrysanthemums with other herbs to treat dizziness and high blood pressure.\nMagnolia bark is known as hou po in TCM and is reportedly good for relieving upper-respiratory congestion. Some scientific research provides evidence for magnolia’s use in fighting tumor growth and depression. It may also play a role in preventing periodontal disease.\nThe Pagoda flower (aka sophora, Styphnolobium japonicum) has antibacterial, antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties. It is used to treat hemorrhoids and excessive menstruation.\nThe viola flower is a common component of healing herbal teas.\nViola flowers contain high levels of vitamins C and A, and are often used in herbal teas for the treatment of fevers and bacterial infections. Viola has also been used to reduce toxicity and swelling due to snakebites.\nLonicera flower, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is traditionally used to “clear heat and remove toxins,” which makes it ideal for fighting colds, inflammation and viruses, including swine flu.\nSafflower may be familiar for its use as a carrier oil for herbal extracts and an ingredient in salad dressings, margarine and cosmetics. Its yellow thistles are sometimes cooked as a cheaper alternative to saffron. In TCM it is used to increase circulation and dissolve clots, making it applicable to the treatment of heart disease and joint pain. It has also been effective in easing cramps and eliminating warts.\n*Please note that the information presented in this blog is not intended as medical advice.

It is a perennial plant that grows up to 1.8 meters in height and can be found in dry to damp thickets, roadsides, slopes, and clearings. It is native to eastern North America but has also naturalized in Britain.\n\nThe plant has yellow flowers and blooms from late summer to mid fall. Both the young leaves and flowering stems of Solidago canadensis can be cooked and used as a food source. The seeds, although very small, can be consumed as a survival food when necessary. Additionally, a tea can be made from the flowers and/or leaves.\n\nMedicinally, Solidago canadensis has several properties. It is known to have antiseptic, haemostatic (stops bleeding), and styptic (contracts tissues) effects. The root can be applied as a poultice to treat burns, and an infusion of the dried powdered herb can be used as an antiseptic.\n\nThe blossoms of Solidago canadensis are analgesic (relieve pain), astringent, and febrifuge (reduce fever). They have been traditionally chewed with the juice swallowed slowly to treat sore throats. The flowers can also be used to make a tea, which is employed in the treatment of conditions such as diarrhea, body pains, fevers, and snakebites.\n\nFurthermore, Solidago canadensis contains quercetin, a compound that is reported to be useful in the treatment of haemorrhagic nephritis. The plant is considered similar to S. virgaurea in terms of its medicinal properties. Goldenrod, including Solidago canadensis, is commonly used as a valuable astringent remedy for wounds and bleeding. It is particularly known for its effectiveness in treating urinary tract disorders, including serious ailments like nephritis.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Solidago canadensis has various medicinal properties, care is needed for individuals with chronic kidney disease, and irrigation therapy is contraindicated in cases of edema due to renal or heart disease.\n\n Spigelia marilandica, the woodland pinkroot or Indian pink, is a perennial wildflower in the Loganiaceae family.
