The personal confrontation between two Russian soldiers and their Chechen captors is the main theme of the film, which was shot in the mountains of Dagestan (mostly in the aul of Ritcha, whose inhabitants are mentioned in the film's credits), a short distance away from the then-ongoing First Chechen War. The First Chechen war was to establish independence from Russia. Bodrov creates contrasting views between these two cultures after two Russian soldiers are captured in exchange for the son of a Chechen's father. This movie revolved around the strife between the people who are caught in the rivalry between the Chechens and Russians. A common theme of Revenge.

Tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 documentary Moscow Elegy, by Russian film director Alexander Sokurov. Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films. Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is a 1988 documentary film by Michal Leszczylowski, an editor of the film The Sacrifice. Film director Chris Marker produced the television documentary One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000. At the entrance to the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, Gennady Shpalikov and Vasily Shukshin.\n\n He was born the son of an officer in the 1st Regiment of Podhale Rifles, major Andrzej Wójcik. At the beginning of Second World War, in September 1939, together with his mother and brother Marian, he was evacuated to Lwów and then returned to Nowy Sącz. After the war, the Wójcik family lived in Boguszów in the Sudeten Mountains. In 1955 he graduated from the Cinematography Department at the National Film School in Łódź and began working in the \"Kadr\" film team. He received his diploma in 1964.

It depicts the attempted invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century by the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire and their defeat by Prince Alexander, known popularly as Alexander Nevsky (1220–1263). Eisenstein made the film in association with Dmitri Vasilyev and with a script co-written with Pyotr Pavlenko; they were assigned to ensure that Eisenstein did not stray into \"formalism\" and to facilitate shooting on a reasonable timetable. It was produced by Goskino via the Mosfilm production unit, with Nikolai Cherkasov in the title role and a musical score by Sergei Prokofiev. Alexander Nevsky was the first and most popular of Eisenstein's three sound films. Eisenstein, Pavlenko, Cherkasov and Abrikosov were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941 for the film. In 1978, the film was included in the world's 100 best motion pictures according to an opinion poll conducted by the Italian publishing house Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Russia Beyond considers the film one of the 10 best Russian war films.\n\n On November 13, 1945, the postwar communist government decreed the formation of Polski Film as a national enterprise. Organized under the Minister of Culture Władysław Kowalski, Polski Film had control over both domestic film production and distribution of all foreign films. In the first years there was still room for smaller production companies, notably Yiddish-language.  Aleksander Ford served as Film Polski's first director from 1945 to 1947. As Roman Polanski noted in his autobiography, Ford was both an \"extremely competent\" manager and \"a veteran party member, who was then an orthodox Stalinist. ...The real power broker during the immediate postwar period was Ford himself, who established a small film empire of his own.\" With colleagues from the Polish United Workers' Party, Ford rebuilt the film production infrastructure, a national studio, and the National Film School in \n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of the director of film Polish-Russian War (Film)?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is headed by private detective Wong Yeuk-sze (Michael Hui) with his emotionally drained assistant Puffy (Ricky Hui). Meanwhile, Lee Kwok-kit (Samuel Hui), a kung fu expert, who works at a Vitasoy plant factory and spends most of the time doing kung fu tricks to impress a girl, ultimately loses his job. Seeking to find another line of work, Lee attempts to joins Wong's detective agency. Despite Lee's impression with his kung fu talent which involves his snatching trick, Wong was not impressed. Then, \n\n films she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years. Her character is usually renamed in film adaptations because of difficulties with the pronunciation of her name. Anna May Wong played Ling Moy in Daughter of the Dragon (1931). Myrna Loy portrayed the similarly named Fah Lo See in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932). Gloria Franklin had the role of Fah Lo Suee in Drums of Fu Manchu (1940). Laurette Luez played Karamaneh in The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu (1956), but the character owed more to Fah Lo Suee than to Rohmer's depiction of Kâramanèh. Tsai Chin portrayed Dr Fu Manchu's daughter Lin Tang in the five Christopher Lee films of the 1960s.\n\n The stories of Dr Fu Manchu, both in print and on screen, have sparked numerous accusations of racism and orientalism, from his fiendish design to his nonsensical Chinese name. After the release of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film adaptation of The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), which featured the Chinese villain telling his followers that they must \"kill the white man and take his women\", the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, issued a formal complaint against the film. Following the release of Republic Pictures' serial adaptation of Drums of Fu Manchu (1940) the U.S. State Department requested that the studio make no further films about the character, as China was an ally against Japan during \n\n 1949, Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu serials, illustrated by Joseph Clement Coll and others, were hugely popular. The first three Fu Manchu novels by Rohmer were actually compilations of 29 short stories that Rohmer wrote for Collier’s. The Mask of Fu Manchu, which was adapted into a 1932 film and a 1951 Wally Wood comic book, was first published as a 12-part Collier's serial, running from May 7 to July 23, 1932. The May 7 issue displayed a memorable cover illustration by famed maskmaker Władysław T. Benda, and his mask design for that cover was repeated by many other illustrators in subsequent adaptations and reprints. A 1951 condensed version of the book Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham also appeared.\n\n (1931) as well as in the short film Murder Will Out (part of the omnibus film Paramount on Parade) in which Dr. Fu Manchu confronts both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes. The most controversial incarnation of the character was MGM's The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932) starring Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy. At the time of its first release the film was considered racist and offensive by representatives of the Chinese government. The film was suppressed for many years, but has been released on DVD uncut.

In 1472 a treaty was conducted with his brother Engelbert II of Nassau in which he was granted the Nassau territory and his brother received the possessions in the Netherlands and left of the Rhine. In 1504 after the death of his brother Engelbrecht II of Nassau in Breda without an heir, Johann's eldest son Henry III of Nassau-Breda succeeded him.

The death of another distant cousin, Duke Alexander Karl, on 19 August 1863 resulted in the ruling line of the duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg becoming extinct, thus Leopold inherited that duchy as well.

The \"Exterminating Angel\" executes a mission of social justice, an apocalyptic laying low of the noble and the powerful.\"\n\n Carlos Reygadas Castillo (born October 10, 1971) is a Mexican filmmaker.

They had first met as children when he was nine and she was seven, at a party at the British embassy in Rome in 1908. When they next met, it was in London many years later. By the time they were married, the world they knew had changed radically, with the collapse of the feudal system in Russia, the rise of the Bolsheviks, and annexation of Georgia by the Soviet Union.

They gave him a three-month sabbatical to make the movie, which Sharp says ignited his interest in working in drama. The film's star Gerry Sundquist was best known for his work in the National Theatre and was cast even though he could not dance. \"It all happened so quickly,\" he later said. \"I couldn't believe it. I was a bit worried at first - it's not exactly Richard the Third is it?... It's about a boy who is really untogether at the beginning.

The film was shot over three weeks.\n\n Steve Sekely (February 25, 1899– March 9, 1979) was a Hungarian film director. Born István Székely, he was known by several names, based on his changing professional and immigration status, including Stefan Szekely. He directed films in Hungarian, German, and English. He worked as a newspaper journalist in Germany, before returning to Hungary in the early 1930s. He directed one of the most famous classic Hungarian films, the frequently revived comedy Hyppolit, a lakáj (1931). That film was remade in 2000 and the original was later digitally restored and released on DVD. Sekely left pre-war Hungary, fleeing growing Fascism and laws restricting rights and professional opportunities for Jews. He worked in Hollywood for much of his subsequent career, directing mostly B movies and early episodic TV, although he directed his best-known English language film, the cult science fiction thriller The Day of the Triffids in the UK and returned to Hungary to direct his final film, The Girl Who Liked Purple Flowers, which was released in 1973.\n\n When the original script, entitled \"Striptease Girl,\" was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors in March 1959, the reviewer termed it \"machine-made dirt\" and \"the worst script I have read for some years\". The project was then renamed \"Beat Girl\" and nudity was reduced, but censors still objected to scenes of strip tease, juvenile delinquency, and teenagers playing \"chicken\" by lying on railway tracks in front of an oncoming train. Ultimately, the film received an \"X\" certificate, causing its release to be delayed because it was queued behind a glut of other X-rated films. When finally released it performed reasonably well at the box office in UK, despite receiving bad reviews. The \n\n at the 10th Guldbagge Awards.

He died at age 81 from a cerebral haemorrhage in St. Görans Sjukhus in Stockholm, leaving behind his wife of 37 years and three children. Shortly after his death, a Swedish appeal court upheld a ruling that Swedish television broadcaster TV4 had damaged his and fellow director Claes Eriksson's \"artistic integrity\" by inserting commercial breaks into broadcasts of their films without their consent. He had been awarded the Ingmar Bergman Prize in 2003 for pursuing this court case.\n\n Beat Girl is a 1960 British teen exploitation film directed by Edmond T. Gréville. The film was released in the United States under the title Wild for Kicks. The title character of Beat Girl was played by starlet Gillian Hills, who later went on to have numerous small roles in 1960s and 1970s films, such as Blowup and A Clockwork Orange, and became a successful \"ye-ye\" singer in France. Beat Girl marked the first film roles of British pop idol Adam Faith and actor Peter McEnery, although it was not released until after other films featuring Faith (Never Let Go) and McEnery (Tunes of Glory) had already come out. The film also features Christopher Lee and Nigel Green as strip joint operators, and Oliver Reed in a small role as one of the \"beat\" youth. The original music was composer John Barry's first film commission, and was performed by the John Barry Seven and Orchestra, Adam Faith, and Shirley Anne Field. The Beat Girl soundtrack was the first British soundtrack to be released on a vinyl LP. It reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, paving the way for the release of other film soundtrack albums.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Beat Girl?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was born on April 5, 1829, in Amissville, Virginia, and was the brother of Ann Reeves Jarvis, who inspired the Mother's Day holiday in the United States. Reeves received his medical education through a combination of self-study, medical apprenticeship, and attending medical college at Hampden Sidney in Richmond.\n\nAfter entering medical practice in Philippi, Virginia, in 1851, Reeves obtained his MD degree from the University of Pennsylvania Medical College in 1860. He settled in Fairmont, Virginia, with his wife and four children, and during the Civil War, he assisted his sister Ann with her Mothers Work Clubs. Reeves played a significant role in the establishment of a state medical society for West Virginia after the war.\n\nIn 1868, Reeves relocated to Wheeling, West Virginia, where he developed a keen interest in public health. He became Wheeling's first permanent health officer in 1869 and later became a founding member of the American Public Health Association in 1872. Reeves contributed to public health legislation by drafting the West Virginia Board of Health Act in 1881 and became the first Secretary of the newly formed board. In 1882, he seized Frank Dent, who was practising medicine without a license, leading to the landmark 1889 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Dent v. West Virginia.\n\nReeves held several prestigious positions within the medical community. He served as the President of the Medical Society of West Virginia in 1882 and as the President of the American Public Health Association in 1885. In 1888, he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he became nationally recognized as a microscopic pathologist. Unfortunately, Reeves passed away due to liver cancer on January 4, 1896.\n\nOverall, James Edmund Reeves played a crucial role in advancing public health practices and legislation in West Virginia and the United States. His contributions to the field continue to be recognized and appreciated in the medical community to this day.\n\n Eleanor P. Sheppard began her civic career as room mother of her daughter's elementary school, then with the Ginter Park Parent Teacher Association (PTA). In 1952, she became president of the Richmond Federation of PTA’s As the prospect of schools being closed to prevent racial desegregation became important, and many awaited the decisions of consolidated cases before the United States Supreme Court that became known as Brown v. Board of Education, Mrs. Sheppard ran for a seat on the Richmond City Council in 1954. She won, and thus became the first woman to serve on that body, and continued to win re-election until resigning in 1968 after winning a seat in the Virginia General Assembly. Fellow city councillors elected Mrs. Sheppard \n\n mayor in 1960, and then elected her mayor in 1962. She became the first woman ever elected mayor of an incorporated city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a photograph of her adjusting her hat on inauguration day was published worldwide. During her two years as mayor, the city faced turmoil as Massive Resistance continued on the state level. Mrs. Sheppard worked to promote urban renewal through the Richmond Citizens Association (which became Richmond Forward) and helped pave the way for Interstate 95, as well as advocated for healthcare and the city's children. In 1967, Mrs. Sheppard ran to become one of Richmond's representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates, as J. Sargeant Reynolds ran to represent the city in \n\n Virginia Senate. She won, and voters re-elected her four times. In that 1967 election, prominent segregationist T. Coleman Andrews, Jr. lost, and another seat in Richmond's delegation was won by William Ferguson Reid, who became the first African American to sit in the Virginia House of Delegates since 1891. Mrs. Sheppard soon sponsored a bill to create Virginia Commonwealth University, working with Byrd Organization lieutenant and veteran state senator Lloyd Bird to combine two existing institutions of higher education, the Medical College of Virginia and the Richmond Professional Institute, to create an urban university, which succeeded on March 1, 1968. Following the 1970 census, her district changed to include only the City of Richmond, eliminating parts of neighboring Henrico County. \n\n Born in Bristol, Florida, Sheppard attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and read law to enter the bar in 1891. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Florida Senate in 1888. He was a collector of customs at Apalachicola, Florida from 1889 to 1894 and from 1897 to 1901. He was in private practice in Apalachicola from 1891 to 1903, serving as Mayor of Apalachicola in 1894. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Attorney General of Florida in 1896.

Descended from a Serer family through his mother from the line of Matar Sène, Ousmane Sembène was particularly drawn to Serer religious festivals especially the Tuur festival.\n\n Mandabi (French: Le Mandat, \"The Money Order\") is a 1968 film written and directed by Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembène. The film is based on Sembène's novel The Money-Order and is the director's first film in his native Wolof language. Since most of the Senegalese population do not understand French, Sembène wanted to create cinema for Wolof speakers.

In 1961, his parents returned to France and settled in Nice. Martinoty studied classical letters and cello. He started his professional life as a French teacher for some years, then becoming a writer and music critic for the newspaper L'Humanité. In 1972, he interviewed the stage director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who invited him to come to the Salzburg Festival where he was preparing Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. After replacing Ponnelle for a rehearsal he became his assistant and the writer of the scripts for most of his opera \n\n (including La clemenza di Tito, Madama Butterfly and Carmina Burana).

It starred Dick Miller and was set in West Coast beatnik culture of the late 1950s. The film, produced on a $50,000 budget, was shot in five days and shares many of the low-budget filmmaking aesthetics commonly associated with Corman's work. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a dark comic satire about a dimwitted, impressionable young busboy at a Bohemian café who is acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor when he accidentally kills his landlady's cat and covers its body in clay to hide the evidence. When he is pressured to create similar work, he becomes a serial murderer. A Bucket of Blood was the first of a trio of collaborations between Corman and Griffith in the comedy genre, \n\nConcussion is a 2015 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the exposé \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published in 2009 by GQ magazine. Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties.\n \nSlate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. In particular, he cites a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMore recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE. For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity. These CTE symptoms include cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems.\n\nAfter comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue. The New York Times discovered emails directly referencing removing \"unflattering moments for the NFL” and removing “most of the bite” out of the film “for legal reasons with the NFL\". Landesman stated the changes were made \"to portray the characters and story as accurately as possible to reduce the chance that the league could attack the filmmakers for taking too much creative license\".\n\nSee also\n League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\n Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis\n Concussions in American football\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n2015 films\n2015 biographical drama films\n2010s sports drama films\n2015 thriller drama films\nAfrican-American biographical dramas\nAmerican films\nAmerican biographical drama films\nAmerican sports drama films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nEnglish-language films\nBiographical films about sportspeople\nDrama films based on actual events\nFilms about diseases\nFilms about suicide\nFilms based on newspaper and magazine articles\nFilms set in 2002\nFilms set in 2005\nFilms set in California\nFilms set in New York City\nFilms set in Pittsburgh\nFilms set in Washington, D.C.\nFilms shot in Pennsylvania\nFilms shot in Pittsburgh\nFilms with screenplays by Peter Landesman\nSports films based on actual events\nVillage Roadshow Pictures films\nColumbia Pictures films\nFilms scored by James Newton Howard\nFilms directed by Peter Landesman\nCultural depictions of players of American football\nCultural depictions of American men\n2015 drama films\n\n worked with director Steve Balderson for Stuck!, a homage to film noir women-in-prison dramas, which co-starred Mink Stole, Pleasant Gehman and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's.

A Cure for Pokeritis, released February 23, 1912, was individually well-received, including in showings outside the United States. The Thames Star, a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as \"screamingly funny\". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled A Sure Cure for Pokeritis), along with many of his other works, as \"Favorite Film Features\". However, the comedy style of A Cure for Pokeritis has not aged well, especially in contrast to Mack Sennett's slapstick films and the works of later comedians such as Charlie Chaplin \n\n The film centers around a serial killer known as \"The Card Player\", who is kidnapping young women in Rome. Using a webcam set-up, the killer challenges the police by forcing them to play hands of Internet poker. If the police lose, the kidnapped victim is tortured and murdered on-screen. When a British tourist is among the girls murdered, policeman John Brennan (Cunningham) is assigned the case and quickly teams up with Italian detective Anna Mari (Rocca). The duo have their work cut out for them when the Police Chief's daughter (Argento) becomes the killer's latest kidnapping victim.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Alexander had met Draga in 1897 when she was serving as a maid of honor to his mother. Draga was twelve years older than the king, unpopular with Belgrade society, well known for her allegedly numerous sexual liaisons, and widely believed to be infertile. Since Alexander was an only child, it was imperative to secure the succession by producing an heir. So intense was the opposition to Mašin among the political classes that the king found it impossible for a time to recruit suitable candidates for senior posts. Before making the announcement, Alexander did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in Karlovy Vary and making arrangements to secure \n\n Themistoklis Sofoulis, Prime minister (1947–1949) ; Alexandros Diomidis, Prime minister (1949–1950) ; Ioannis Theotokis, caretaker Prime minister (1950) ; Sofoklis Venizelos, Prime minister (1950) ; Nikolaos Plastiras, Prime minister (1950) ; Sofoklis Venizelos, Prime minister (1950–1951)  Serbia & Yugoslavia  Kingdom of Serbia / Yugoslavia: Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes / Kingdom of Yugoslavia ; Monarchs (Serbia / Yugoslavia) – ; Alexander of Serbia, King (1889–1903) ; Peter I, King (1903–1921) ; Alexander of Yugoslavia, Prince Regent (1918–1921), King (1921–1934) ; Paul, Prince Regent (1934–1941) ; Peter II, King (1934–1945) ; Presidents of the ministry: Serbia (complete list) – ; \n\nAlexander I of Russia (1777–1825), emperor of Russia ; Alexander II of Russia (1818–1881), emperor of Russia ; Alexander III of Russia (1845–1894), emperor of Russia ; Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia (1842–1858) ; Alexander of Bulgaria (1857–1893), first prince of modern Bulgaria ; Alexandru Ioan Cuza, first prince of unified Romania (1859–1866) ; Alexander I Obrenović of Serbia (1876–1903), king of Serbia ; Alexander, Prince of Lippe (1831–1905), prince of Lippe ; Alexander I of Yugoslavia (1888–1934), first king of Yugoslavia ; Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia (born 1945), head of the Yugoslav Royal Family ; Zog I, also known as Skenderbeg III (1895–1961), king of Albanians ; Alexander of Greece (1893–1920), king of Greece ; Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (1939–2011), king of Albanians (throne pretender) ; Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands (born 1967), eldest child of Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus \n\n Alexander Obrenović with Peter Karađorđević, a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain Dragutin Dimitrijević, also known as \"Apis\", and Novak Perišić, a young Serbian Orthodox militant who was in the pay of the Russian Empire, as well as the leader of the Black Hand secret society which would assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. Several politicians were also members of the conspiracy and allegedly included former Prime Minister Nikola Pašić.

Both immediately resigned, and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom. Opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of congratulations of Nicholas II of Russia to the king on his engagement and of his agreement to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900.

The poem had raised eyebrows in the Chinese Internet community when some people deciphered a hidden message in it that says \"Go to hell Japan, Koizumi must die\" (日本去死, 小泉定亡). It was later revealed that the poem was written around 2003 to 2004. \"Fei hua qing han\" roughly means \"a cold and flying chain of flowers\".\n\n He spent his spare time writing books for children in simple language. His chief works are The Sunday-School Teacher and God and His creatures, which has been published in French. He wrote a scathing answer to an attack on his works by the Saturday Review. His writings were assailed as \"infamous publications\" by the rationalist historian William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of European Morals, chiefly on account of the somewhat lurid eschatology of the children's books, which today can seem traumatizing, even as more than four millions of his booklets were sold. He warned the 'little child' reading The Sight of Hell (1861), for example, that 'if you go to Hell, there will be a devil at your side to strike you. He will go on striking you every minute for ever and ever'. In the 'dungeons of hell', he shows his child readers a girl wearing a dress of fire that always burns her, but never kills her, because she went dancing instead of to church; a boy, who also went to 'dancing-houses' and theatres, endures an eternity of his blood boiling throughout his body.\n\n \"The Tyger\" is a poem by the English poet William Blake, published in 1794 as part of his Songs of Experience collection and rising to notoriety in the romantic period. It has been the subject of both literary criticism and many adaptations, including various musical versions. The poem is one of the most anthologised in the English literary canon. The poem explores and questions Christian religious paradigms prevalent in late 18th century and early 19th century England, discussing God's intention and motivation for creating both the tiger and the lamb.\n\n During the end of 1816, Hunt began to put together his ideas for a poem that would become The Nymphs. While working on the poem in 1817, Hunt was staying at the Albion House in Marlow and spent much of his time in the garden or walking through the countryside. During this time, he heard stories of Francis Dashwood and his Hell-Fire Club, which its members spent their time drinking and pursuing women. The poem was included in Hunt's collection of poems called Foliage, which was published in early 1818. The Nymphs was the first poem in the book. When Hunt republished The Nymphs in his collected works, he did not republish portions of the poem possibly because of the themes not matching those found in his other works.\n\n Although supposedly located in Thessaly, the description used in the poem is based on the landscape surrounding Marlow and the Thames river valley. In addition to the landscape, elements of the Hell-Fire Club enter into the poem. These British based subjects are combined with Greek mythology along with creatures that Hunt made up on his own. All of the creatures are related to Pan and natural religion that was based in liberty. In doing so, the poem discusses British society and how to fix the problems in the world. In particular, Hunt attacked the established Anglican faith and problems related to the religion. While working on the poem, Hunt defended John Wright against claims that the Unitarian minister was promoting blasphemy. The poem serves to defend the freedom of conscience while attacking the intolerant people. The work as a whole was a parallel to John Keats's Endymion written at the same time, and both Keats and Hunt were influenced in their understanding of paganism by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Wallenstein.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She was recommended to Caesar by his father and it is believed that the future dictator of Rome married Cossutia after he began wearing the toga virilis. Both families issued coins with her image and were inscribed with Uxor Caesaris. No children sprang from this relation. In 84 BC, after his father's death, Caesar left Cossutia and married Cornelia, as that was more pragmatic than the earlier relation to Cossutia. It is also possible that Caesar chose to leave her to marry Cornelia because he had been nominated as Flamen Dialis, a role which demanded marriage to a patrician via confarreatio.\n\nHis first wife was Ilia, according to Plutarch.

Rehm was supportive of Flanner's career until his death. In 1918, the same year she married her husband, she met Solita Solano in Greenwich Village, and the two became lifelong lovers, although both became involved with other lovers throughout their relationship. Solano was drama editor for the New-York Tribune, and also wrote for National Geographic.

It was first published in the London Mercury in January 1922 in twelve sections, and later reprinted in The Garden Party and Other Stories (1922) with a short descriptive coda which is now the thirteenth section. The story represents Mansfield’s best mature work, a luminous example of her literary impressionism. While writing it at the Chalet des Sapins in Montana (now Crans-Montana), Switzerland, she was coming to terms with her relationship with her husband John Middleton Murry and with her own origins and identity. Along with Prelude, The Doll’s House and The Garden Party she uses her childhood in what are her most famous New Zealand stories, stories which display her talent at its most commanding and indescribable. She saw them as part of a “novel” to be called Karori (after the suburb she grew up in) and having two story cycles about the Burnell family and the Sheridan family.\n\n Cleary met his wife Joy on his boat trip to England in 1946 and married her five days after they landed. They had two daughters, Catherine and Jane, the latter of whom died of breast cancer at age 37, predeceasing both of her parents. Joy Cleary developed Alzheimer's disease and went to live in a nursing home prior to her death in 2003. \"I was very, very lucky\", said Cleary of his marriage. \"We were in love from the day we met to the day we – sorry, I mean she – died.\" Cleary was good friends with fellow writers Morris West and Alexander Baron. He was a regular churchgoer, attending Mass every Sunday. For the last three years of his life, he was in ill-health, attended by a full-time carer, and in and out of hospital with heart problems.

Mansfield, ill with tuberculosis, lived in the Montana region of Switzerland (now Crans-Montana) from May 1921 until January 1922, renting the Chalet des Sapins with her husband John Middleton Murry from June 1921. The house was only a \"1/2 an hour's scramble away\" from von Arnim's Chalet Soleil at Randogne. Von Arnim visited her cousin niece often during this period. They got on well, although Mansfield considered the much wealthier Von Arnim to be patronising. Mansfield satirised Von Arnim as the character Rosemary in a short story, \"A Cup of Tea\", which she wrote while in Switzerland. She studied at the Royal College of Music, principally learning the organ.\n\n Tuscia, directed by Sergio Baldassarre, is available. Lappin's second novel, Katherine's Wish, is a meta-fictional re-elaboration of textual documentation pertaining to the final phase of Katherine Mansfield's life. Written from three points of view, that of Katherine Mansfield, of her companion, Ida Baker, and of her husband, John Middleton Murry, Katherine's Wish recreates a slice of Mansfield's life from 1918 until her retreat to Fontainebleau, to Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1922, where she died in 1923. The novel focuses on Mansfield's triangular relationship with Ida Baker and Middleton Murry while tracing her artistic and spiritual quest. Lappin's third novel Signatures in Stone Caravel Books 2013 is set in the Monster Park of Bomarzo, and draws inspiration from the early twentieth century British writer, Mary Butts.\n\nQuestion: Why did John Middleton Murry's wife die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His brother was Hafiz Zayn ad-Din who he later migrated with across Greater Khorasan to study Islamic theology and the natural sciences. He is said to have married at the age of 45 and had a daughter in Bukhara who locals refer to as Makhdum-e-Jahan. After completing his education to a good level, he decided to move to Delhi in circa 1260, where he taught for 10 years with the permission of Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban.

The teenage Sham'un was enlisted as a clerk to Emir Bashir Shihab II and as a tutor to his children. The young princes were contemptuous of their adolescent teacher who lost his temper because of his pupils' constant defiance and slapped the eldest of them in the face. When confronted by Emir Bashir, Sham'un exhibited courage and rectitude and justified his act by saying that it was his duty to tutor and educate the princes so that \n\n He was born in 932 or in 933, probably in Iraq and specifically in Baghdad, as his father Abi'l-Ala Sa'id—a son of the Hamdanid family's founder, Hamdan ibn Hamdun—occupied a distinguished position in the court of the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir (reigned 908–932). Abu Firas's mother was a Byzantine Greek slave concubine (an umm walad, freed after giving birth to her master's child). His maternal descent later was a source of scorn and taunts from his Hamdanid relatives, a fact reflected in his poems.

He signed with the Byzantine Empire a pact of mutual non-aggression, but violated it once or twice. The renown of this Kurdish Muslim prince grew so much that the inhabitants of al-Ruha (Edessa, present-day Sanli Urfa), at the west, called him to free them from an Arab chief.

In 975, he received the title of \"I'zaz al-Dawla\" (\"Fortification of the Empire\"), while several other of his family members and officers received other titles. After the defeat of his father in 977 at the hands of his relative 'Adud al-Dawla, he, along with his father and uncles went to Damascus, where they were warmly received by its ruler, Alptakin, who, however, made them involved in his conflict with the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. A battle shortly ensured at Ramla between the army of Alptakin and the Fatimids. However, during the battle, Marzuban betrayed Alptakin and abandoned the battlefield.

It starts with a battle raging between the Turks and the Poles. The Poles are losing until the Cossacks arrive to save the day. However, it turns out that the Poles were merely holding back so that they could treacherously attack the Cossacks after they won the battle for them.

A group of Polish Jews decide to rebel against the Germans and not to lend a hand to the murder of their brethren. They begin to organize their people to protect the honor of the Jewish people.

In 2017, he was honoured with the President Lech Kaczynski Award for outstanding contributions to Polish art and culture, along with his brother, film director Antoni Krauze, at the VII Congress of the Polish Great Project in Warsaw. Andrzej Krauze was further named a laureate of Polish art and awarded the Gold Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis, which is the highest distinction that the Minister of Culture can give to an artist on behalf of the Polish Republic. Krauze lives in London. He continues to have his work published widely in both England and Poland and has recently exhibited in Warsaw and Tuscany.\n\n The history of cinema in Poland is almost as long as the history of cinematography, and it has universally recognized achievements, even though Polish films tend to be less commercially available than films from several other European nations. After World War II, the communist government built an auteur-based national cinema, trained hundreds of new directors and empowered them to make films. Filmmakers like Roman Polański, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Żuławski, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish film-making. In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made, and with many independent filmmakers of all genres, Polish productions tend to be more inspired by American film.\n\nQuestion: Do both films Payment On Demand and My Cousin From Warsaw have the directors from the same country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The situation differed from the previous one as this time Caterina had the approval of her children and she also obtained the consent of her uncle. The marriage of two people from such powerful families, however, was likely to arouse opposition, so they were wed in secret in September 1497. In April 1498, Caterina bore Giovanni a son, the last of her children. The child was baptised as Ludovico after his mother's uncle, the Duke of Milan, but later he became known by the name Giovanni delle Bande Nere.

Some of his council advised him to marry Beatrice, whose worth exceeded his own personal fortune and territorial control, despite that she was twenty years his elder. Once he obtained his new wife's resources, he easily conquered the various rulers of the smaller neighboring domains. Building on the Facino's foundation, he reconstructed a state that began to compare of that of his father, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, before it fell apart under his brother Giovanni's rule. However, despite the wealth, territory, and military strength that she had brought to him, Filippo grew averse to Beatrice, perhaps because of jealousy of her late husband's reputation, or her own political power, or her greater age, or that she bore no children, or his favoring of his mistress, the much younger Agnese del Maino.\n\n At the age of 20 she married Marc Antonio Michiel on 25 October 1775. They followed her father to Rome, not long after, where he had been named the Venetian ambassador to Pope Pius VI. Though she only stayed one year she made a profound impression on the Roman society and was given the nickname Venerina Veneziana, Venetian Venus. It was during this trip that Giustina gave birth to a daughter in 1776, Elena. They had two other daughters who were born over the course of the next two years, Cecilia and Chiara (died at age ten).

Gian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: Giovanni Maria in 1388 and Filippo Maria in 1392. In 1395, for 100,000 florins, Gian Galeazzo obtained the Duke of Milan's title from the Emperor Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Natural Born Pranksters is a 2016 American comedy film starring YouTuber celebrities Roman Atwood, Dennis Roady, and Vitaly Zdorovetskiy.

Bruce Humberstone (Charlie Chan at the Opera / Sun Valley Serenade), whose films ranged from Charlie Chan to Tarzan, puts forth his best effort in this thrilling film noir. I Wake Up Screaming was remade in 1953 as Vicki. Dwight Taylor bases his screenplay on the book by pulp writer Steve Fisher. In a jarring move that works in an odd way, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' is the soundtrack that can be heard throughout. This early film noir, shot in a naturalistic style, showed how dark photography can increase a brooding mood and make the film more tense... The conclusion is filled with plot twists and surprise character revelations, as the marvelously sinister performance by Laird Cregar as the sicko detective dominates the screen.\"\n\n Charlie Chan Carries On is a 1931 American pre-Code mystery film directed by Hamilton MacFadden and starring Warner Oland, John Garrick and Marguerite Churchill.

His father's political attachment to the cause of Italy prompted his arrest by Papal officers. This led to economic difficulties for the Campriani family. He was enrolled in the Naples Institute of Fine arts, but he proved recalcitrant to academic discipline, and abandoned the institute to paint on his own.

Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the \"great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the cinquecento\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters.

Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\".

Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer, stating that the track was only written to \"soften the blow\" of Parton and Wagoner's split.\n\n many people are unaware of its origin; during an interview, Parton's manager Danny Nozel said that \"one thing we found out from American Idol is that most people don't know that Dolly Parton wrote [the track]\". During an interview on The Bobby Bones Show, Dolly Parton revealed that she wrote her signature song \"Jolene\" on the same day that she wrote \"I Will Always Love You.\" Several times (long before Whitney Houston recorded the song), Dolly Parton suggested to singer Patti LaBelle that she record \"I Will Always Love You\" because she felt LaBelle could have sung it so well. However, LaBelle admitted she kept putting off the opportunity to do so and later deeply regretted it after she heard Whitney Houston's rendition.\n\n After Whitney Houston's recording of the song became a hit in 1992, the tabloid press began reporting on a 'feud' between the two performers, stemming from Dolly Parton allegedly reneging on an agreement that she would not perform the song for a number of months while Houston's version was on the charts, so as not to compete with Houston's recording. However, both Parton and Houston dismissed any rumors, speaking glowingly of one another in interviews. Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song. In return, Parton thanked Houston for bringing her song to a wider audience and increasing the amount of royalties for the song \n\n \"I Will Always Love You\" is a song written and originally recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. Written as a farewell to her business partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, expressing Parton's decision to pursue a solo career, the country single was released in 1974. The song was a commercial success for Parton, twice reaching the top spot of Billboard Hot Country Songs: first in June 1974, then again in October 1982, with a re-recording for The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas soundtrack. Whitney Houston recorded a rendition of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. Houston's single spent 14 weeks at the number one spot of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting a new record at the time, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time, and the best-selling single by a woman. The song has been recorded by many other artists including Linda Ronstadt, John Doe, Amber Riley, LeAnn Rimes and Sarah Washington, whose dance version reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n Country music singer-songwriter Dolly Parton wrote the song in 1973 for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was separating professionally after a seven-year partnership. She recorded it in RCA Studio B in Nashville on June 12, 1973. Author Curtis W. Ellison stated that the song \"speaks about the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman that does not descend into unremitting domestic turmoil, but instead envisions parting with respect – because of the initiative of the woman\".

Ultimately, he returned to academics in the early 1980s. It was during the early 80s and his initial years in college while DJing at a nightclub in West Hollywood California called Studio One, that Berry noticed various acquaintances and “party-goers,” who would suddenly become ill and die from what would later come to be known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He believed that sexual transmission was implicated in what was then called GRID (Gay-related immune disorder). He abandoned the party disco atmosphere of the early 80s to focus on academics and pursue a career in medicine.\n\nPaul S.

He was a known savant who could not quite understand people, but was able to build or fix just about anything. At six years old, he was disassembling and reassembling watches and even engines. He often devised and conducted elaborate science experiments in his family's basement, saying he blew himself up a few times. His mechanical ingenuity only expanded, along with his behavioral difficulties. DeFriest was close with his father, who encouraged his mechanical abilities, and the two had what filmmaker Gabriel London calls \"a mechanical connection.\" His father had served in World War II with the OSS, a predecessor to the CIA. This experience likely prompted Mark's father to teach his son the avoidance tactics, survival, and defense techniques that Mark describes as guerilla warfare. His father died suddenly in 1979, but in his will left his tools to DeFriest.\n\n Chern grew up in Texas and attended Plano East Senior High School in Plano, Texas, where he started his first web company at age 17.

In 1367, James, lord of Piedmont, a cousin of Amadeus, died. There was a dispute over his inheritance between his eldest son, Philip and his widow, Margaret of Beaujeu, representing the interests of her young sons, Amadeus and Louis. Bonne, acting as regent, was only able to keep them from open war. She was not able to settle the dispute, and Philip had to go to Amadeus in Venice to try to get resolution. \n\nMargaret (died 23 November 1464), married Theodore II of Montferrat, beatified by Pope Clement IX in 1669 ; Bona (21 June 1390 &ndash; after 1392), probably died young ; Matilda (died 14 May 1438), married Louis III of the Rhine ; Catherine (born 1400) Amadeus or Amedeo of Savoy (1363 &ndash; 7 May 1402) was the son of James of Piedmont and his third wife Marguerite de Beaujeu. By James' will of 16 May 1366, he was declared his firstborn (his elder half-brother was considered a traitor by their father) and heir. In 1367, he succeeded his father in his titles of Lord of \n\n In 1383, when her husband, Amadeus VI, died, he left a will granting his wife power over the government of Savoy despite their son, Amadeus VII, being in his early twenties. With the support of the Council, led by Louis de Cossonay and composed of several of her allies, such as Otton de Grandson, Bonne governed Savoy in her son's name. According to Max Bruchet, one of the fears of the Council in those days was the growing influence of French princes over Savoy: the Duke of Berry had married his daughter to Amadeus VII and his grandson, Amadeus VIII, would one day rule Savoy. The young Amadeus was also betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Philip II, the Duke of Burgundy. Both princes had been youngers brothers of Charles V, the King of France, and were now acting as regents for their nephew, Charles VI.\n\n Amadeus IV (died 1369) was the Count of Geneva from 1367 until his death. He was the second son of Amadeus III and Mahaut d'Auvergne. He succeeded his childless brother Aymon III in August 1367. He reversed the policy of his father and brother respecting the House of Savoy, and supported the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva against his cousin Amadeus VI of Savoy. Amadeus seems to have come to terms with his Savoyard cousin by 13 May 1368, the date on which he performed the act of homage to him for the county of Geneva. He then travelled with the count of Savoy into Italy for the campaign to bring Philip II of Piedmont to submission, and was present at Philip's trial by a stacked Savoyard court at Rivoli in September–October 1368. It is possible that the real reason for his accompanying Amadeus into Italy was to have an opportunity to speak with the Emperor, who was also in the region at that time. In February 1369 the Emperor repeated his revocation of Amadeus VI's vicariate. Amadeus IV died later that year.\n\n Bonne of Bourbon (1341 – 19 January 1402) was a Countess of Savoy by marriage to Amadeus VI of Savoy. She was the daughter of Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, and Isabella of Valois, and hence a sister of Joanna of Bourbon. She served as regent of Savoy during the absence of her spouse from 1366 to 1367 and in 1383, and during the minority of her grandson Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy in 1391-1395.\n\nQuestion: Who is the maternal grandfather of Amadeus Vii, Count Of Savoy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Monitored by Dispatching Gas, the high and medium-pressure pipelines carry the gas to sixty or so communes that are connected to the national gas network. Pressure-reducing stations that supply the local networks then reduce the gas pressure. Creos ensures the distribution of natural gas in 45 communes. Since 1 October 2015, Creos and its Belgian counterpart Fluxys Belgium, in collaboration with their respective regulators ILR and CREG, have merged the two national markets into one single Belux market.

Through Constantine I of Greece, another son of Olga and George I, Konstantin is also the paternal great-great-grandfather of Queen Sofía of Spain, mother of King Felipe VI.\n\n Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich of Russia (14 February 1850 – 26 January 1918) was the first-born son of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich and Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna of Russia and a grandson of Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nQuestion: When did Prince John Konstantinovich Of Russia's mother die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These gifts are ceremoniously given before few days of marriage. The tradition in India is to give away articles that the new couple would need as part of their life together. The items may include a car, jewelry, bed, dressing table, clothes, Saree etc. Dowry is an illegal practice, but India marriages being deep-rooted in tradition, follow the practice of giving dowry to the groom's family. The term ‘trousseau’ originates from a French word that means ‘bundle’. It is generally used for a bundle of clothes, money, and other articles that a bride gets in her marriage. This giving of articles, clothing, and money is an important part of the Indian wedding. This practice is an age old tradition and even today in the modern times it is considered to be an earthly treasure.\n\nIn India, brides traditionally wear a red sari, called the sari of blood, offered by their father, signifying that his duties as a father are transferred to the new husband, and as a symbol of his wish for her to have children. Once married, the bride will wear a sari with a red border, changing it to a white sari if her husband dies. In Pakistan and India, some brides traditionally also have their hands and feet painted red with henna by the family of their new spouse, to bring happiness and signify their new status. In many Asian countries, red is the traditional color for a wedding dress today, symbolizing joy and good fortune.\n\n She is married to Sunil Joglekar and has a son.\n\n Devi's fascination with India began at 15 when she read a book by poet-philosopher Rabindranath Tagore and a yoga instruction book by Yogi Ramacharaka. In Berlin, she worked as an actor in The Blue Bird, touring Europe, and accepted a proposal of marriage from the banker Herman Bolm, on condition she could first go to India; he agreed and paid for the trip. She set off on 17 November 1927, crossing India from south to north, wearing a sari for the first time, sitting on the floor and eating with her fingers. She came back three months later, a changed woman, speaking only of India, and returned Bolm's engagement \n\n He married for the first time in April 2018 in Saudi Arabia at the age of 56.\n\nQuestion: Which country Audofleda's husband is from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The distance by modern roads is about 130 miles; the fictional character walked for seven days. Walking, he avoided looking like a wealthy target on horseback for the marauding forces of Geoffrey de Mandeville, successfully carrying the news of the attacks as he travelled. Longner Manor, the home of the Blount family, is not far from Shrewsbury with one crossing of the River Severn, shown best on this map of the area near Shrewsbury.\n\n commissions appointed to inquire what sums were due to the king or his father for sale of lands; to raise money by the sale of crown lands to the yearly value of 1,000£; and to survey the state of all the courts erected for the custody of the king's lands. In April 1553 he was again appointed ambassador to the Emperor Charles V, at whose court he remained until April 1554. On his return from Germany he brought with him one Remegius, who established a paper mill in this country—perhaps at Fen Ditton, near Cambridge. At heart a Roman Catholic, Thirlby was soon \n\n becoming entangled in bicycle wheels. He was also a well-known potter, setting up his \"Sunflower Pottery\" in the Court grounds with the help of a local boy called George Masters. \"Elton ware\" became popular, especially in America where it was marketed by Tiffany & Co. Elton and Masters' work typically has a variety of rich colours, bas-relief decoration of flowers in a style similar to Art Nouveau, and in the later works metallic glazes are often used. Sir Edmund's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920. His son Sir Arthur was one of the pioneers of documentary film making in the years \n\n The story takes place in Shrewsbury Abbey. The site past Frankwell along the River Severn is a real location. Then Frankwell was outside the walls of Shrewsbury, considered a suburb. Brother Cadfael sought young Father Eadmer at his uncle's home in Attingham. That is a real place about four miles to the southeast of Shrewsbury, near Attingham Park, not far from Wroxeter (mentioned in The Hermit of Eyton Forest, an earlier novel in the series). The time was the Anarchy in England, when King Stephen was challenged by his cousin Empress Maud for the crown. In 1143, fighting was not near Shrewsbury; but King Stephen was acting to strengthen his connections with the border lords like Earl Ranulf of Chester. Young Henry Plantagenet, son of Empress Maud with her second husband, Geoffery of Anjou was in Bristol, age 10, taking lessons and spending time with his mother and uncle. That young man would become Henry II, succeeding King Stephen. Geoffrey spent his time keeping the holdings in Anjou and Normandy, never joining his wife to gain her the crown of England.\n\n The troubles of the Dublin theatres drove King back to Drury Lane, where he became a mainstay of the cast for over 30 years. He reappeared as Tom in the Conscious Lovers, on 2 October 1759, and was assigned leading parts. With occasional visits to Dublin or to country towns, and with one season at Covent Garden and a summer visit to the Haymarket, he remained at Drury Lane until 1802. On his reappearance at Drury Lane he was accompanied by Mary Baker, a hornpipe dancer, who then made her first appearance at Drury Lane. He married her in 1766, and she retired from the stage 9 May 1772. King's characters covered well over one hundred parts. At Drury Lane King was, on 31 October 1759, the original Sir Harry's servant \n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Letter To The King?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Sheepdogs were the first unsigned band to make the cover of Rolling Stone and have gone on to a career featuring multi-platinum album sales and four Juno Awards. Frontman Ewan Currie, the band's primary songwriter, has described the band's guitar-driven blues-rock style as \"pure, simple, good-time music\"; he's said that the band aims to land in the sweet spot in between Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills & Nash. Currie has further credited Creedence Clearwater Revival, Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, and The Allman Brothers Band as influences on the band's style. One critic has praised the band's \"infectiously catchy, soulful, retro sound with beautiful harmonies and a pinch of southern rock.\" The Sheepdogs are on the road frequently between recordings. They have headlined tours across Canada and the United States, UK, Eastern and Western Europe, and Australia, and have performed at a number of large festivals including South by Southwest, Coachella, Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, and Lollapalooza.\n\n Catfish and the Bottlemen are a Welsh indie rock band. Formed in 2007 in Llandudno, Wales, the band's debut album, The Balcony, reached number 10 in the UK Albums Chart and achieved Platinum status on 30 December 2016. The band has toured in South America, Japan, UK, Europe, North America, and Australia and have featured in a number of festivals including Lollapalooza, Glastonbury, Latitude, Falls Festival, Community Festival, Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, Governors Ball, All Points East, Bonnaroo, Splendour in the Grass, and Trnsmt Festival. They won a Brit Award for British Breakthrough act on 24 February 2016. On 27 May 2016, they released their second album, The Ride, which reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart and has sold 300,000 units in the UK since its release. On 26 April 2019, they released their third album, The Balance, which reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\n The Hook And Pull Gang, Green Telescope and Goodbye Mr Mackenzie enjoying record company interest Mitschell agreed to relocate to Scotland to help push the band forward. Their live reputation followed them from America and with a strong three-track demo labels Warner Brothers, Virgin and Arista showed an interest in signing them, having been exposed to the independence and freedom of the Minneapolis scene, the band were reluctant to tie to a major label despite the financial stability it would have given them. Plans were then made to release their long overdue debut album on their own label and a distribution deal was signed \n\n The release was called \"a rare crossover\" Country and Western album that \"is synthpop at its core;\" \"a wild west of urban cowboys, honkey-tonk angels and truck-driving women.\" Through \"a hoedown of bouncy and bombastic country-western covers,\" band members Jess and Jeff DeCuir dubbed \"electronic music's own Carter & Cash\" eschew the \"twang and wail of traditional country instruments.\" As a substitute \"on the 'Nashville in the 23rd Century' rendition of 'Boney Fingers,' Jess DeCuir's theremin is a most perfect Country instrument as it hauntingly twangs.\" Pansentient League reviewer Jer White wrote that \"Hyperbubble are fast becoming the masters of conceptual synthpop, what with this delightful album and things like last year's synthpop coloring book Music to Color By.\" Their \"The Electric Horseman\" was described as \"a meaty take on the instrumental from the Robert Redford film of the same name\" and that it represents an \"extended (version) from the original which incidentally also featured a sequencer line.\" Chain D.L.K. gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and Pansentient League named it a Top Ten for 2017.\n\n Snowcake was a Scottish band formed in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1983 by guitarist-singer Axel Fischer (AKA Alex) and bassist Ag Holstrom (AKA Agstrom), which was notable for its influence on US alternative rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Unusually for a band of their significance, they hardly produced any recorded output and their influence was solely due to their live performance. With a shared love of US hardcore, the 1970s NY punk scene and early US alternative rock, Fischer and Holstrom wrote songs prolifically using firstly a number of temporary drummers and then an early drum machine, the band gigged heavily \n\nQuestion: Are both bands, Snowman (Band) and Jessamine (Band), from the same country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As with \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Power to the People\" – Lennon singles from 1969 and 1971 respectively – the chorus has an anthem-like quality, as he sings: \"We all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.\" Norman describes the chorus as Lennon restating his message of \"peace campaigning and non-violent, optimistic togetherness\". According to Lennon biographer John Blaney, the song is an appeal \"for mankind to take responsibility for its fate\" and represents \"Lennon developing his own brand of egalitarianism\".\n\n Imagine is the second studio album by English musician John Lennon, released on 9 September 1971 by Apple Records. Co-produced by Lennon, his wife Yoko Ono and Phil Spector, the album's lush sound contrasts the basic, small-group arrangements of his first album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), while the opening title track is widely considered to be his signature song. Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, Abbey Road Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with supporting musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner. Its lyrics reflect peace, love, politics, Lennon's experience with primal scream therapy, and, following a period of high personal tensions, an attack on his former writing partner Paul McCartney in \n\n New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material. Amid frequent court appearances battling to stay in the United States, Lennon became stressed, a situation that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, \"I just couldn't function, you know? I was so paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me.\" All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the \n\n  In a 1980 interview, Lennon referred to this song as his \"first real major piece of work\" because it was the first time he penned personal lyrics about his own life. According to Lennon, the song's origins can be traced to when the English journalist Kenneth Allsop made a remark that Lennon should write songs about his childhood. Afterwards, Lennon wrote a song in the form of a long poem reminiscing on his childhood years. The original version of the lyrics was based on a bus route he used to take in Liverpool, naming various sites seen along the way, including Penny Lane and Strawberry Field. Lennon later thought the original lyrics were \"ridiculous\", calling it \"the most boring sort of 'What I Did on My Holidays Bus Trip' song\". He reworked the words and replaced the specific memories with a generalised meditation on his past. \"Very few lines\" of the original version remained in the finished song. According to Lennon's friend and biographer Peter Shotton, the lines \"Some [friends] are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all\" referred to himself and Stuart Sutcliffe (who died in 1962).\n\n original master take of \"You Are Here\" featured an extra verse, that was about Japan and England. Other songs on the album are more light-hearted and optimistic, marking the return of Lennon's humour and wit after the uncompromising doctrine espoused on Some Time in New York City. These tracks include \"Intuition\", in which Lennon relates how life experience has honed his instincts and how it's good to have gotten through it. While demoing the song on piano in early 1973, with the lyrics still incomplete, he added a few lines from two previously released tracks – \"How?\", from Imagine (1971), and \"God\", from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970). \"Only People\" reflects his \n\nQuestion: Where was the performer of song God (John Lennon Song) born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The play was based on the true story of Wilhelm Voigt, a German ex-convict who masqueraded as a Prussian military officer in 1906 and became famous as the Captain of Köpenick. The Captain from Köpenick was Oswald's second film version of the story; the first was a 1931 German film also called The Captain from Köpenick. In the intervening years Oswald had fled Nazi Germany for France, then the United States; this was his first American film. It was completed in 1941, but due to difficulty finding a distributor, it was not released until 1945.\n\n John Henry Pegg, a lawyer and husband of his stepdaughter Isobella, died. Isobella and her two children moved back to London to live with her mother and Kidd. In 1852, his stepson, Captain John Carphin, was killed in a gunfight in California and his other stepson, George Carphin first mate of the Eglinton, was shipwrecked on the coast of Australia. The news of these events, Kidd's lingering mental illness and the failing finances may have contributed to the death of Kidd's wife and she died in July 1854 leaving Kidd alone with the burden of a stepdaughter and two stepgrandchildren.\n\n Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd was filmed from February 27 through March 25, 1952. Since Universal would not budget the extra money to make the film in color, the duo opted to do it themselves. Using a contractual agreement with Universal that permitted them to make one independent film per year, they made the film using Abbott's company, Woodley Productions (and their first color film, Jack and the Beanstalk, using Costello's company, Exclusive Productions). Produced during a slump in Charles Laughton's career, the accomplished actor signed on to do the film for a mere $25,000. Shortly after filming was completed, on April 6, Abbott and Costello hosted an episode of the Colgate Comedy Hour and brought Laughton along as a guest. Later that year, the three of them filmed a two-minute commercial for Christmas Seals.\n\n Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is a 1952 comedy film directed by Charles Lamont and starring the comedy team of Abbott and Costello, along with Charles Laughton, who reprised his role as the infamous pirate from the 1945 film Captain Kidd.

Maria Amalia was born in Florence, the then-capital of Tuscany, where her father reigned as Grand Duke from 1765 to 1790. Her father was a son of Empress Maria Theresa and her mother a daughter of Charles III of Spain. Her godparents were her mother's first cousin, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, and his wife, Maria Amalia, her father's sister. She had a happy childhood surrounded by her many siblings. As her siblings, Maria Amalia was given a somewhat different upbringing than was usual for royal children at the time: they were actually raised by their parents rather than a retinue of servants, were largely kept apart from any ceremonial court life and were taught to live simply, naturally and modestly. In 1790, her father became emperor and the family moved to Vienna. She died unmarried at the age of only 18 years in Vienna.\n\n Leopoldina Maria, Princess of Savoy was born at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia.

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time she experiences delusions about meeting God, who ultimately appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Meanwhile, her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, and her brother struggles with sexual frustration. Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of Fårö, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. Through a Glass Darkly was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films Winter Light and The Silence.\n\nDead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Notably, it was the first American film to win the Tiger Award at the Rotterdam Film Festival.

Such calculations are useful in the design of artificial heart valves.  From this work has emerged an original computational method for fluid-structure interaction that is now called the “immersed boundary method\". The immersed boundary method allows the coupling between deformable immersed structures and fluid flows to be handled in a computationally tractable way. With his students and colleagues, Peskin also has worked on mathematical models of such systems as the inner ear, arterial pulse, blood clotting, congenital heart disease, light adaptation in the retina, control of ovulation number, control of plasmid replication, molecular dynamics, and molecular motors.\n\nPeskin received an A.B. (1968) from Harvard University and a Ph.D. (1972) from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University and shortly thereafter joined the faculty of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

The film stars Harrison Ford as a New York City lawyer from a dysfunctional family who struggles to regain his memory and recover his speech and mobility after he survives a shooting, inadvertently restoring his family's integrity in the process.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Annette Bening, Mikki Allen, Bill Nunn, Rebecca Miller, Bruce Altman, and Elizabeth Wilson. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the cast and Ford's performance but criticized for its sentimentality and manipulativeness. The film grossed $88 million at the box office on a production budget of $25 million.\n\nPlot\n\nAmbitious, callous, narcissistic, and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a wealthy successful Manhattan lawyer whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his socialite wife, Sarah, and troubled preteen daughter, Rachel. He has just won a malpractice suit, defending a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned doctors about a pre-existing condition.\n\nRunning out to a convenience store to buy cigarettes one night, Henry is shot when he interrupts a robbery. One bullet hits his right frontal lobe, while the other hits his left subclavian artery, causing excessive internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. He experiences anoxia, resulting in brain damage.\n\nHenry survives but can neither move nor talk and he suffers retrograde amnesia. While in a nursing facility, he slowly regains movement and speech with the help of a physical therapist named Bradley. Henry's recovery creates a financial burden for the family. Upon returning home, Henry is almost childlike. As he forges new relationships with his family, he realizes he does not like who he once was.\n\nSarah enrolls Rachel into an out-of-town elite school, though she is now reluctant to go.

He was a star shortstop at the city's S.J. Peters High School, where one of his teammates was Mel Parnell. Strickland also played for the Southwest Sectional champions representing his hometown at the American Legion Baseball World Series in Miles City, Montana in 1943. Immediately after the tournament, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team at the time, and made his professional debut on September 5, 1943. He appeared in only three games that season, all as a third baseman, and collected two singles in eight at bats. Strickland's baseball career was interrupted when he was drafted into the United States \n\n Jerry Reuss (born June 19, 1949)—pronounced \"royce\"—is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball, best known for his years with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, Sigismund I the Old, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia, which had been held by the order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). The new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on \n\n the works of Erasmus Reinhold and Caspar Hennenberger. During the final years of his rule, Albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now-depleted church lands, causing peasant rebellion. The intrigues of the court favourites Johann Funck and Paul Skalić also led to various religious and political disputes. Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568. His son, Albert Frederick, succeeded him as Duke of Prussia. Albert's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\n Albert was born in Ansbach in Franconia as the third son of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. His mother was Sophia, daughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, and his wife Elisabeth of Austria. He was raised for a career in the Church and spent some time at the court of Hermann IV of Hesse, Elector of Cologne, who appointed him canon of the Cologne Cathedral. Not only was he quite religious; he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories. His career was forwarded by the Church, however, and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advancement. Turning to a more active life, Albert accompanied Emperor Maximilian I to Italy in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Albert Frederick, Duke Of Prussia's mother?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The lost control of the car that she was driving and crashed into crash barriers, which caused her to lose both of her legs below the knee. A few years after the accident, she went to the Court of Rome to sue Anas, the company that improves safety of motorways, for the poor maintenance of the crash barrier which caused her life changing injury, the court ruled that the barrier was of \"very poor maintenance conditions and had very serious installation anomalies\", Anas stated that they \"could not allow the barrier extension on the stretch of road without imposing necessary measures to eliminate risks\", Versace was awarded compensation of €1,485,182.\n\nOne of the most common types of vehicle accidents - up to 28% of all car accidents according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - are rear-end collisions. These crashes occur when a vehicle hits the one in front of it. Although many are minor fender-benders, some rear-end collisions can cause severe injuries and even death.\nDriver distraction, such as using a cellphone for texting, is all too often the cause of rear-end accidents. Poor driving including speeding, tailgating or reckless driving can also cause this type of accident, as can driving under the influence and fatigue. Other causes not always in the driver's control include brake failure and poor weather or road conditions.\nWhiplash is a very common injury in rear-end crashes. When the car is hit from behind, the body jerks forward and then the head and neck instantly whip back and forth causing muscle, ligament and nerve damage.\nAnother very serious injury is traumatic brain injury or TBI. TBI is caused by the brain hitting against the inside of the skull during some type of trauma like an accident or violent shaking. The brain damage that results can be life-altering, causing temporary or permanent disability or even death.\nOther serious injuries can include spinal cord damage, bone fractures and lacerations. If seat belts are not worn or if the head restraints are insufficient, any injuries can be even worse.\nSometimes at the scene of a rear-end collision - and shortly after - the victims won't realize that they have been injured because symptoms are somewhat delayed. It may take some time for signs of injury like pain or stiffness to appear.\nHowever, it's important to get medical attention as soon as you can. Go to a hospital emergency room or your own doctor for an evaluation.\nThere are 2 reasons for this recommendation - one of course is to take care of any health issues caused by the accident, but the second is that an insurance company may try to minimize any damages if the victims don't get medical attention, especially in a low-speed rear-end collision.\nIf you have been injured in a rear-end collision, you may be eligible for compensation from the at-fault driver for medical expenses, lost wages, physical therapy, rehabilitation and any other costs associated with your injuries.\nIf you or a family member has been injured in a rear-end accident or any type of car accident or personal injury, please contact the Law Offices of Diana Santa Maria, P.A. immediately.

According to witnesses, Busch had left a bar early one morning with Frederick. The vehicle wrecked at a 25 mph curve known for accidents. The car flipped and Frederick flew through the sunroof and was probably killed instantly when the car rolled over her. Busch left the scene of the accident without informing anyone. When police arrived on the scene hours later, they found several empty Bud Light cans lying near the car, and inside the car a wallet with two driver's licenses registered to Busch, and a handgun.

He drove her to the hospital where she was told one child was dead, and saw her husband and two other children seriously injured, covered in oil and mud. She suffered serious nervous shock as a result and sued the defendant who was responsible for the accident. Earlier decisions in English courts had allowed victims to recover damages for psychiatric injury sustained as a result of witnessing the imperilment of a loved one, but only where the claimant was actually present at the scene. This case was unique at the time because the claimant suffered injuries away from the scene of the accident and hours after the accident occurred. This case is frequently examined by law students and students of legal philosophy. Legal scholar Ronald Dworkin used the case as subject matter in a hypothetical case examined by a fictional, ideal judge named Hercules in his book Law's Empire.\n\nQuestion: Where did Giacomo Feo's wife die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Gonzalez's treatments are based on the belief that pancreatic enzymes are the body's main defense against cancer and can be used as a cancer treatment.  His methods have been generally rejected by the medical community. and he has been characterized as a quack and fraud by other doctors and health fraud watchdog groups. In 1994 Gonzalez was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \"departing from accepted practice\".\n\nIn one non-randomized clinical trial of terminally ill patients with pancreatic cancer, the Gonzalez-treated patients were found to have died much earlier than those treated with conventional chemotherapy. A better quality of life was reported by the chemotherapy arm.\n\nBiography\nGonzalez was born December 28, 1947 in Flushing, New York. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from Brown University, with a degree in English literature. From 1970–1977, Gonzalez worked as a journalist for Time Inc. and as a freelance writer, covering a variety of health-related topics, including a July 1972 cover story in New York Magazine, a 1976 cover story for Family Health Magazine, and an article for Prevention Magazine. Gonzalez became interested in medical research, cancer research in particular, while covering these topics.\n\nGonzalez completed postgraduate premedical work at Columbia University and received his medical degree from Cornell University in 1983. Gonzalez worked with Robert A. Good at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center while in medical school. After receiving his medical degree, Gonzalez completed an internship in internal medicine at Vanderbilt University. From 1984-1986, Gonzalez worked with Good again, completing a fellowship in immunology while at University of Oklahoma and All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nGonzalez died of a suspected heart attack on July 21, 2015 at age 67. A conspiracy theory has subsequently spread that Gonzalez was murdered as part of a systematic plot to kill \"holistic\" practitioners.\n\nCancer treatment and its effectiveness\nGonzalez's treatment methods, which he's been using since 1987, are developed from previous work by the orthodontist William Donald Kelley. Gonzalez believed that cancer is caused by a poor diet, a problem compounded when one does not eat a diet that corresponds with one's \"metabolic type\"; and environmental pollution and daily stress only contribute to health problems. The Gonzalez regimen proposes as a treatment a cure-oriented change in life style and nutrition, the use of oral pancreatic enzymes, large numbers of dietary supplements (up to 150 pills per day) and twice daily coffee enemas. According to the National Cancer Institute, which co-sponsored with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine a clinical trial on Gonzalez's treatments produced \"limited and inconclusive\" results regarding the efficacy of the Gonzalez Regimen as a treatment for cancer.\n\nIn 1999 Gonzalez published an article describing prolonged life in a small group of patients with pancreatic cancer in the peer-reviewed journal Nutrition and Cancer. Subsequently, others concluded that the longer survival time reported by Gonzalez was due to selection bias and other confounds.\n\nRejection by mainstream medicine\nLike his mentor, William Donald Kelley, Gonzalez's treatment method has been \"rejected\" by the \"medical establishment\". Gonzalez has been characterized as a quack and fraud by other doctors and health fraud watchdog groups, and in 1994 was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \"departing from accepted practice\". Forced to submit to psychological examinations and undergo retraining, Gonzalez was given two years of probation with a stipulation that he undergo retraining and do 200 hours of community service, which he completed satisfactorily. He was fully licensed to practice in New York.\n\nGonzalez lost two malpractice lawsuits. In 1997, a New York court found Gonzalez \"negligent\" for his cancer treatment; according to news reports, Gonzalez \"had to pay $2.5 million in damages to a patient he wrongly claimed to have cured\" of cancer. The former patient had been diagnosed with uterine cancer but \"Gonzalez discouraged her from following through on her cancer specialist's advice, instead recommending dietary supplements and frequent coffee enemas\". The patient had refused both standard treatment and an experimental protocol, but after the cancer spread to her spine, she discontinued Gonzalez's treatment and received chemotherapy and external beam radiation. Sometime in this period, she began having problems with her eyesight, back and hip, and she eventually became blind. In 2000, Gonzalez was found partly liable (49%) in the death of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma and ordered to pay $282,000 in damages, due to his use of an unproven cancer screening method instead of standard cancer testing.\n\nThe American Cancer Society notes that there is \"no convincing scientific evidence that [the Gonzalez treatment] is effective in treating cancer\" and that some portions of the treatment may be harmful. A review article from the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology is cited that notes the clinical efficacy of coffee enemas has not been proven and the therapy is associated with adverse effects previously described in a few case reports. Gonzalez's study published in Nutrition and Cancer in 1999 was criticized by an expert in integrative oncology research methods for its small sample size, selection bias, and failure to account for confounding variables.\n\nGonzalez \"never explicitly rejected the more orthodox precepts of his profession\", insisting that he wanted his research evaluated by independent scientists.\n\nClinical trial\n\nA randomized phase III clinical trial for the possible treatment of pancreatic cancer with the Gonzalez Regimen was funded by a $1.4 million grant from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and co-sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, awarded in 1999 to Columbia University's Rosenthal Center for Alternative Medicine. The trial was designed to compare the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet with gemcitabine for stage II, stage III, or stage IV pancreatic cancer. However, the study had difficulty attracting patients, and most eligible patients refused random assignment, so the trial was changed in 2001 to a controlled, observational study.\n\nThe trial found that patients treated with the Gonzalez regime survived on average for 4.3 months; those using standard chemotherapy survived on average for 14 months and reported a better quality of life.\n\nAn accompanying editorial said it was troubling that expensive CAM therapies were not backed by firm evidence, and that the trial of the Gonzalez regimen was not capable of providing a definitive conclusion because of flaws in its design. Kimball Atwood said that flaws in the trial design might have led to bias in favor of the Gonzalez regimen but that it nevertheless amounted to \"a slam-dunk condemnation\" of the therapy.\n\nThis trial had been criticized for its implausible and unsupported theoretical model of cancer development which bears no resemblance to the scientific understanding of neoplasia, and because of Gonzalez's history of malpractice.\n\nSee also\nList of ineffective cancer treatments\n\nReferences\n\nPublications\nWhat Went Wrong: The Truth Behind the Clinical Trial of the Enzyme Treatment of Cancer (2012, New Spring Press; )\nOne Man Alone: An Investigation of Nutrition, Cancer, and William Donald Kelley (2010, New Spring Press; )\nGonzalez NJ, Isaacs LL.

This stated that Maurelius was born in Edesa as one of the sons of Theobald, the pagan king of Mesopotamia. Two more sons were born to his father when Maurelius was aged 18, named Hippolytus and Rivallus. When Maurelius reached the age of 30 he revealed to his father that he had converted to Christianity but his father refused permission for him to continue living as a Christian. He succeeded his father on his death, but passed the throne to Hippolytus soon afterwards to follow his faith more closely, beginning spiritual instruction under Theophilus of Antioch, bishop of Smirne, who finally ordained him a priest. Theophilus then \n\n Hugh was the grandson of Pepin of Heristal and Plectrude on his father's side, and of Waratton and Ansfledis on his mother's. Both Waratton and Drogo were mayors of the palaces. While still a layman, Hugh was endowed with Jumièges Abbey, which he entered as a monk in 718 under Abbot Cochin. He later became vicar-general of the diocese of Metz. In 722, Hugh was elected to the vacant archdiocese of Rouen. In 723, he accepted charge of Fontenelle Abbey. In 724, he took on the administration, together with his own, of the dioceses of Paris and Bayeux. At the end of his life, Hugh retired to Jumièges, where he died on 9 April 730. He is interred in Notre-Dame de Paris. In the ninth century his relics were relocated out of Paris in order to save them from profanation at the hands of Vikings. He is regarded as a saint and his feast day is kept on 9 April.\n\n Remigius was educated at court, but, along with his brothers, (Bernard and Hieronymus) was denied any share of his father's patrimony which was apportioned among Charles' legitimate sons. In 737, he was sent with his half brother Pepin the Short to strengthen Charles' hold on Burgundy. In 755, Remigius became Archbishop of Rouen. In 760, he accompanied Pepin to Italy, with his two brothers to mediate between Pope Paul I and Desiderius. Upon his return, he brought with him an instructor from The Schola Cantorum of Rome to teach his clergy Roman chants. Remigius died in 772; in 1090, his relics were translated to the Abbaye Saint-Ouen de Rouen. During the turmoil of the Reformation in 1562 his reliquary was lost. His feast day is January 19. He was instrumental in implementing the Roman rite and chant in the Gallic church.\n\n Gustave was the son of Anne Emmanuel Ferdinand François, 8th Duke of Croy, and Auguste Friederike Wilhelmine zu Salm-Kyrburg. He was ordained a priest on 3 November 1797 in Vienna. On 8 August 1817 he was appointed Bishop of Strasbourg by King Louis XVIII of France; the appointment was confirmed by Pope Pius VII on 23 August 1819. He was ordained a bishop on 9 January 1820 at the Church of St. Sulpice in Paris by Jean Charles de Coucy, Archbishop of Reims. He was made a Peer of France in 1822 and became Archbishop of Rouen on 4 July 1823. In 1824 he assisted King Louis XVIII of France on his death bed and presided over his funeral in the Abbey of Saint-Denis. On 21 March 1825 he was created a cardinal by Pope Leo XII. He did not receive the red hat until 18 May 1829. Three days later on 21 May 1829 he received the title Cardinal-Priest of Santa Sabina. He participated in the conclaves of 1829 and 1830-1831. He died of gout. His remains are buried in Rouen Cathedral.\n\n He was born in Tressan (France) in 1670. He was the second son of Jérémie de Tressan; from what is considered a very old Languedoc family. His father, Maréchal de camp of Louis XIV, married Marguerite de Béon (House of Béon-Luxembourg) on March 1 1667. His brother was François de La Vergne, Marquess of Tressan. Louis de La Vergne de Tressan received a licence in theology from the University of Paris.

Greenaway explains the conspiracy about a murder and the motives of all its characters who have conspired to kill for their combined self-advantage.

He was the posthumous son of Margrave Henry I and Gertrude of Brunswick, daughter of Egbert I of Meissen. He was by inheritance also Count of Eilenburg. He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin. He was initially under the regency of his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123. His lands were inherited by his half-sister Richenza of Northeim. He left a widow, Adelaide, daughter of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark. The succession to the marches was disputed after his death.  \n\n Thietmar (IV) (born ca. 990; died 10 January 1030) was the Count of the Schwabengau and Nordthüringgau from 1010 and the Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark from 1015 until his death. He was the son and successor of Margrave Gero II. His mother was Adelaide. In 1028, the Ostmark, with the rest of the eastern marches of the Duchy of Saxony fell under attack from Mieszko II of Poland. The Emperor Conrad II rushed from central Saxony and trekked over very wild terrain to besiege the Poles in Bautzen.

In 1016&ndash;1017, his father, Bernard I (1009-1018), feuded with Gero, Archbishop of Magdeburg, and consequently with the Emperor Henry II over the ambitions of the Magdeburger church.

Count Christian, probably a scion of the Billung dynasty, had married Hidda (d. 970), a sister of Gero, margrave of the vast marca Geronis in the lands settled by Polabian Slavs. From 945 he also ruled over the adjacent gau of Serimunt beyond the Saale river.

He was therefore probably a grandson of Hidda and Christian of Thuringia and named for his great uncle Gero the Great. He succeeded his probable uncle, Hodo, as Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark including Mark Lausitz (Lusatia) in 993 upon the death of margrave of Lusatia Hodo or Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark.

With a length of 2100 km, it is the longest segment, from Chita to Khabarovsk, connecting the paved roads of Siberia with those of the Russian Far East. The construction of the road united the Russian federal highways into a single system stretching from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok. Before completion of the road, the Russian Pacific coast was connected to the rest of the country only by airlines, the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the Baikal–Amur Mainline. For most of its route, the highway parallels the China–Russia border at a distance of 100-200 km., it still included unpaved sections.

Founded by astronomer Richard A. Proctor, the magazine started as a weekly periodical, becoming monthly in 1885. The magazine was known for its extensive correspondence columns. Proctor himself, the first editor, was a significant contributor, and many of his discoveries or theoretical deductions first appeared in the magazine. Proctor was sometimes assisted in editorial duties by Edward Clodd. After Proctor's death in 1888, Arthur Cowper Ranyard took over editorship, then Harry Forbes Witherby after Ranyard's death.\n\n The magazine also offered a \"Resources\" section which contained references for the articles. Like Discover, Science was aimed at readers looking for something more readable than the Scientific American of those days, which was a much more technical magazine than it became in the 1990s, but more in-depth and more artfully written than magazines like Popular Science, which tends to cover technology more than the science behind it. This market proved to be too small for the large number of magazines that attempted to serve it, and many disappeared during the mid-1980s. Science was purchased in 1986 by Time Inc. and folded into Discover, the last issue being July 1986. A few issues of Discover after the merger feature a stamp noting \"Now including Science 86\", but this quickly disappeared.\n\n The Society for Amateur Scientists was the brainchild of Shawn Carlson, Ph.D, a physicist from the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Particle Astrophysics. Inspired by the example of his grandfather, a gifted amateur scientist named George Donald Graham, Carlson founded SAS in San Diego, California on January 1, 1994. Members of the founding Board of Trustees included Nobel Prize winner Glenn Seaborg and Guggenheim Fellowship winner Paul MacCready. Dr. Carlson led the organization for 16 years until he closed it to pursue other interests in science education. In 1995, Scientific American magazine tapped Carlson, due to his leadership in the citizen scientist community, to write their long running column The Amateur Scientist. During the six years \n\n Science was a general science magazine published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from 1979 to 1986. It was intended to \"bridge the distance between science and citizen\", aimed at a technically literate audience who may not work professionally in the sciences. The AAAS also publishes the famous science journal Science, the similar name leading to some confusion. Science was first issued as Science 80 in November 1979 and was originally published bi-monthly and by subscription only. The name of the magazine changed every year to reflect the publication date, becoming Science 81, Science 82, etc. The magazine was similar to Discover in terms of coverage, but tended to offer longer articles and often a photoessay. Guest essays by a well-known scientist were a common feature as \n\n American Scientist (informally abbreviated AmSci) is an American bimonthly science and technology magazine published since 1913 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society.

The pre-release working title was Island of Forgotten Sins.\n\n The film was one of three Harry Alan Towers made at the Hong Kong studios of Run Run Shaw the others being The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (also directed by Jeremy Summers, with Christopher Lee in the title role and Maria Rohm again named Ingrid) and The Million Eyes of Sumuru (with Klaus Kinski and Maria Rohm in supporting roles). In September 1966 Don Sharp was going to direct. The film originally planned to feature George Sanders and Basil Rathbone as two of the Dragons. Cummings met his fourth wife Regina Fong who was a script girl on the film. Five Golden Dragons was one of a number of lighthearted spy and action films released during the second half of the 1960s. A year earlier, in April 1966, two other films were released in London with a similar plot of a tourist being chased by assassins — A Man Could Get Killed, directed by Cliff Owen and Ronald Neame and starring James Garner as well as Harry Alan Towers' Our Man in Marrakesh, directed by Don Sharp and starring Tony Randall, with Klaus Kinski, Margaret Lee and uncredited Maria Rohm in supporting roles.\n\n My Wife's Lodger is a 1952 British comedy film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Dominic Roche, Olive Sloane and Leslie Dwyer.

Scholars disagree about the number of children born to Mary Kittamaquund and Giles Brent. Some list only three children named in the 1663 and 1671 wills of Giles Brent and his sister Margaret. Margaret Brent appointed her brother Giles “and his children Giles (Jr) Brent, Mary Brent, and Richard Brent” executors of her estate. Giles left bequests to his son Giles (Jr) Brent and daughter Mary Brent (Fitzherbert). However, Dr. Lois Green Carr, Maryland Historian at the Maryland State Archives, left a note card in her files which identify six children of Mary and Giles, including Katherine Brent (said to have married Richard Marsham), Giles (Jr) Brent (who married his cousin Mary Brent), Mary Brent (who married John Fitzherbert), Richard Brent (who died after December 26, 1663), Henry Brent (who died young), and Margaret Brent (who also died young).

He is best known for installing site-specific underwater sculptures that develop into artificial coral reefs, which local communities and marine life depend on. Taylor integrates his skills as a sculptor, marine conservationist, underwater photographer and scuba diving instructor into each of his projects. By using a fusion of Land Art traditions and subtly integrating aspects of street art, Taylor produces dynamic sculptural works that are \n\n on the ocean floor to encourage marine life, to promote ocean conservation and to highlight the current climate crisis. Taylor's works in Grenada have been listed among the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic. His most ambitious projects to date include the creation of the Cancún Underwater Museum, Ocean Atlas, and the installation of Museo Atlántico, the first underwater museum in Europe and in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Lanzarote, Spain. Taylor has received four Guinness World Records, one of which was awarded in February 2021 for creating the most underwater artworks in the world.\n\n The film follows Jacques-Yves Cousteau, a French ocean-going adventurer, biologist, and filmmaker. It sticks to historical events, and was based on documentation and interviews with people who worked with Cousteau. In 1949, Cousteau was an eccentric naval officer in France, with a beautiful oceanside house, who wanted to be a pilot. But he quits the Navy to explore and document the ocean. His boat, Calypso, was a 1941 minesweeper. The film is a biopic covering aquatic adventures over thirty years. Cousteau is revealed to be an adventurer but also an inventor. He designed the autonomous regulator, but also had romantic views of colonising \n\n In 1963, French oceanographer and filmmaker Jacques Cousteau spent 30 days living underwater in Conshelf Two, in the Red Sea. The footage was turned into the Academy Award-winning film World Without Sun. Subsequently, his television show, The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, was seen by audiences around the world. Cousteau was one of the world's first advocates for governmental action in environmental protection and, by the time of his death in 1997, was one of the world's most famous television personalities.

Matsusaka received his Ph.D. in 1952 at Kyoto University; he was a member of the Brandeis Mathematics Department from 1961 until his retirement in 1994, and was that department's chair from 1984–1986. He was invited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Edinburgh in 1958 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. During the difficult years after the Second World War, Matsusaka worked on several problems connected with Weil's Foundations of Algebraic Geometry. This led to a correspondence and eventually Weil invited Matsusaka to the University of Chicago (1954–57) where they became life-long friends. After three years at Northwestern University and a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, he went to Brandeis University in 1961 where he stayed until 1994, helping to build the department to its current prominence. Matsusaka was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1959–1960. In 1972, Matsusaka introduced Matsusaka's big theorem, a key technical result on ample line bundles.\n\n Pierre Émile Cartier (born 10 June 1932) is a French mathematician. An associate of the Bourbaki group and at one time a colleague of Alexander Grothendieck, his interests have ranged over algebraic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, and category theory. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris under Henri Cartan and André Weil. Since his 1958 thesis on algebraic geometry he has worked in a number of fields. He is known for the introduction of the Cartier operator in algebraic geometry in characteristic p, and for work on duality of abelian varieties and on formal groups. He is the eponym of Cartier divisors and Cartier duality. From 1961 to 1971 he was a Professor at the University of Strasbourg. In 1970 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice. He was awarded the Prize Ampère of the French Academy of Sciences in 1979. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\n\n Henry Morgan Ward (August 20, 1901 – June 26, 1963) was an American mathematician, a professor of mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. Ward was born in New York City. He received his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1928, with a dissertation entitled The Foundations of General Arithmetic; his advisor was Eric Temple Bell. He became a research fellow at Caltech, and then in 1929 a member of the faculty; he remained at Caltech until his death in 1963. Among his doctoral students was Robert P.

He is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century. Born in Germany, Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in France, and he and his family were persecuted by the Nazi regime. For much of his working life, however, he was, in effect, stateless.

The film stars Harry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon, a doctor who is trying to find a cure for breast cancer. The film also stars Paula Cale, Angie Harmon and Amanda Bynes in supporting roles.\n\nPlot\nThe film follows the true story of Dr. Dennis Slamon (played by Harry Connick, Jr.), who helped develop the breast cancer drug Herceptin, over the course of 8 years from 1988 to 1996. Dr. Slamon is a physician scientist at UCLA Medical Center (Los Angeles), where he has developed the experimental drug Herceptin, which he believes will become a treatment for breast cancer. However, when the drug company stops funding the research, philanthropists, including Lilly Tartikoff (Angie Harmon) and Ronald Perelman help him continue drug reseach. Funding was done with an initial donation from Perelman's Revlon charity, and continued over the years with the \"Fire and Ice Ball\" organized by Tartikoff.\n\nEventually the drug company funds the research and the drug goes through three trials before gaining approval from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Prior to the trials, the drug undergoes a preclinical animal trial. Nicole (Tammy Blanchard), a young mother with stage 4 cancer, receives the drug first. Although her mother Elizabeth (Swoosie Kurtz) pleads with Dr. Slamon, Nicole is not included in the subsequent trials as she does not meet the trial requirements. The women in the trials, particularly the first trial, band together. They handle their disease and drug trial, with humor—Tish (Jennifer Coolidge), or with alternative therapy—Tina (Trudie Styler). The stories of Barbara (Bernadette Peters) and Ellie (Regina King) are followed throughout, as they go through the trials and eventual recovery. Some patients involved in the tests die, but ultimately Slamon's work with the drug changes the course of breast cancer treatment.\n\nCast\nHarry Connick, Jr. as Dr. Dennis Slamon\nPaula Cale as Donna Slamon, Dr. Slamon's wife\nAngie Harmon as Lilly Tartikoff, wife of Brandon Tartikoff (NBC Television president)\nAmanda Bynes as Jamie, Dr. Slamon's student assistant\nBernadette Peters as Barbara Bradfield, a retired art teacher and the first woman the drug trial saved by Herceptin\nRegina King as Ellie, a fashion designer and breast cancer survivor\nJohn Benjamin Hickey as Blake Rogers, Dr. Slamon's friend and fellow scientist\nSwoosie Kurtz as Elizabeth, Nicole's mother\nMelissa McBride as Sally\nTammy Blanchard as Nicole, the first woman to receive Herceptin\nAmy Madigan as Fran Visco, President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition\nTrudie Styler as Tina, participant in Phase One of the Her2 study\nJennifer Coolidge as Tish, participant in Phase One of the Her2 study\nBruce McKinnon as Dean Bradfield, Barbara Bradfield's loving husband\nLance E.

It is an adaptation of Robert Bazell's book HER-2: The Making of Herceptin, a Revolutionary Treatment for Breast Cancer. The film was the first mainstream feature film to be scored as a solo project by composer Halli Cauthery.\n\nRenée Zellweger, in her first television project, is executive producer, with Neil Meron and Craig Zadan producers. Zellweger has produced one film prior to this, Miss Potter (2006). Zellweger suggested casting Harry Connick, Jr. for the film. They had acted together in the romantic comedy New in Town.\n\nFilming of Living Proof took place in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2008. The filming location was suggested by Connick, because, he said: \"It's expensive to film in Los Angeles, and my being from New Orleans, it's a chance to help the city get back on its feet a little bit by employing a lot of the local people.\"\n\nRelease\n\nRelease \nThe film premiered on October 18, 2008, for Lifetime's \"Stop Breast Cancer for Life\" public service and advocacy campaign, during the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

It's that sort of movie – one without much use for subtlety – but the theme and execution should resonate strongly with those who tune in, helping promote the network's \"Stop Breast Cancer for Life\" public-awareness campaign.Lifetime movies often get a bad rap...but every , they genuinely do some good by doing well.\"\n\nThe Denver Post critic wrote:\"A stunning lineup of talented actresses combines with a lively script to distinguish what might have been a fairly ordinary disease movie on Lifetime this weekend. A based-on-truth testament to perseverance and essential human goodness, the film offers proof that determined individuals can win the fight against huge, heartless drug companies.\"\n\nThe USA Today critic wrote:\"'Living Proof' knows its target audience, though, and appeals to it with an earnestness made more engaging by a string of winning performances. Connick sustains the breezy charm he has shown as an actor and musician, but also shows a decided urgency in tracing Slamon's often frustrating, sometimes desperate struggle to get the support and funds required for his work...The women who take part in those trials are presented as a motley sorority and portrayed with a decided lack of vanity. Glamorous gals such as Bernadette Peters, Trudie Styler and Tammy Blanchard turn up looking weary and strained but also evoke the humor and resilience of their characters...Swoosie Kurtz and Regina King add extra sass as, respectively, Blanchard's mother and another young woman who survives cancer only to see it return in a more aggressive form.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Streaming video of Living Proof at MyLifetime.com (not available for European residents)\nVariety article, \"Hosts set for third annual Fire & Ice Ball\", November 18, 1992\n\n2008 television films\n2008 films\nAmerican films\nBreast cancer\nEnglish-language films\nFilms based on non-fiction books\nFilms directed by Dan Ireland\nFilms shot in New Orleans\nLifetime (TV network) films\nFilms about cancer\n\n Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II.

He is known for his research on the role of genetics in sexual orientation and for a series of popular books and documentaries that have changed the understanding and perceptions of human sexuality and gender identity.\n\nEducation and career\nBorn in Montclair, New Jersey, Hamer obtained his BA at Trinity College, CT, and his PhD from Harvard Medical School. He was an independent researcher at the National Institutes of Health for 35 years, where he was the Chief of Gene Structure and Regulation Section at the U.S. National Cancer Institute; upon retirement in 2011 he was designated Scientist Emeritus. Hamer has won numerous awards including the Maryland Distinguished Young Scientist Award, the Ariens Kappers Award for Neurobiology, New York Times book-of-the year author, and an Emmy Award.\n\nBiotechnology research\nHamer invented the first method for introducing new genes into animal cells using SV40 vectors while a graduate student at Harvard Medical School. This approach was used to produce a variety of biomedical products including human growth hormone and a vaccine for Hepatitis B, resulting in 4 US patents.\n\nAt NIH, Hamerʻs lab initially focused on the metallothionein gene system. They elucidated the mechanism of induction of yeast metallothionein by copper ions, one of the first eukaryotic gene regulatory systems to be understood at the molecular level and a useful method for regulating therapeutic protein production.\n\nHuman sexual orientation and behavior genetics\nIn the 1990s Hamer began studies on the genetics of human behavior, which led to the first molecular evidence for genes that influence human sexual orientation. His research group's first paper, published in Science in 1993, reported that the maternal but not paternal male relatives of gay men had increased rates of same-sex orientation, suggesting the possibility of sex-linked transmission in a portion of the population. A genetic linkage analysis of DNA samples from these families showed that gay brothers had an increased probability of sharing polymorphic markers on the subtelomeric region of the long arm of the X chromosome, Xq28,  providing statistically significant evidence for linkage to the sexual orientation phenotype. This finding was replicated in two other studies in the United States whereas a study in Canada found contrary results; meta-analysis of all  data available at that time suggested that Xq28 has a significant but not exclusive effect. Subsequently, a genomewide scan by Hamerʻs group revealed additional regions on autosomes that were moderately linked to male sexual orientation.\n\nHamer's results were robustly replicated in 2012 in a large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation conducted by several independent groups of researchers. Analysis of 409 pairs of gay brothers with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers confirmed the Xq28 linkage by two-point and multipoint LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer labʻs previous genomewide study. The authors concluded that \"our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation.\"  In August 2019, a genome-wide association study of 493,001 individuals concluded that hundreds or thousands of genetic variants underlie same-sex sexual behavior in both sexes, but in contrast to linkage studies they found no excess of signal on Xq28 or the rest of the X chromosome. This study was questioned on account of its reliance on a dichotomous ever/never measure that lumped together predominantly heterosexual, bisexual and homosexual individuals, including those who only experimented once with a same-sex partner, possibly resulting in misleading associations to personality traits.  Hamer said that the findings of the 2019 study do not reveal any biological pathways for sexual orientation, but stated he hoped it would be the first of many to come.\n\nHamer’s findings provoked extensive public reaction, often based on misunderstanding of the science, which led to his interest in explaining the data to a wide audience through a book written in collaboration with a  journalist.  Social science surveys have shown that research on the origins of sexual orientation has a strong positive influence on people’s attitudes of acceptance and inclusion of LGBT people.\n\nHamer and colleagues also investigated the genetic roots of anxiety and found that a promoter region polymorphism in the gene for the serotonin transporter, which is the target of antidepressant drugs such as Prozac, is associated with mood and personality. This finding has been extensively replicated and extended and its activity has been confirmed by direct brain imaging studies.\n\nIn 2004, Hamer used data from ongoing behavioral genetics studies in his lab to explore the possibility of genetic influences on spirituality. In The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes, he proposed that a quantitative measure of self-transcendence is partially heritable and may be correlated to a specific gene, VMAT2, involved in monamine metabolism. Hamer's speculations on the possible role of genetics in religious experience  were featured in a cover story in Time magazine.\n\nHIV/AIDS treatment and prevention\nHamer's lab developed several biotechnological strategies to treat and reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS. As a means to reduce the latent pools of virus responsible for viral persistence, they discovered novel chemical agent to induce integrated virus, and molecularly-engineered immunotoxins to destroy the infected cells.  They also collaborated with Osel, Inc. on a novel \"live microbial microbicide\" approach to HIV/AIDS prevention. By genetically engineering normal vaginal bacteria to produce a potent anti-HIV peptide, significant protection against viral infection was provided in a durable and obtainable fashion for up to one month. The methodology was shown to be applicable to both rectal and vaginal use and is in the initial stages of preclinical testing.\n\nFilms and media\nHamer turned to documentary filmmaking to address complex scientific and social issues often overlooked by the mainstream media. In 2005, he and partner Joe Wilson formed Qwaves with the mission of producing \"insightful and provocative films that emanate from the voices of those on the outside and compel us to question and to act.\" Their short films won multiple awards including winner of the PBS Independent Lens Shorts Festival and Seeds of Tolerance Award.\n\nOut in the Silence, the first feature film from Qwaves, documented the controversy that was ignited by Hamer and Wilson's wedding announcement in Wilson's conservative small hometown in Pennsylvania.  The film was supported by the Sundance Documentary Film Program and won an Emmy Award for achievement in documentary. The Out in the Silence Youth Activism Award was initiated in 2011 to highlight the contributions of young people to achieving respect, inclusion and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nIn 2011, Hamer and Wilson moved to Hawaiʻi to begin a series of films about Pacific Islander lives and voices and long tradition of acceptance of sexual and gender minorities. Their feature documentary Kumu Hina, about transgender native Hawaiian teacher and cultural icon Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, was supported by ITVS, Pacific Islanders in Communications and the Ford Foundation and won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary and the Independent Lens Audience Award on PBS.\n\nIn 2017, Hamer and Wilson, with Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu as producer,  released Leitis in Waiting and Lady Eva, which documented the lives of transgender women in the conservative South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga.  This was followed in 2019 by The Rogers, about transgender men in Samoa.  These films became part of a campaign to decriminalize same-sex relationships across the Pacific.\n\nHamer, Wilson and Wong-Kalu continued their collaboration in 2020 with the animated short film Kapaemahu, based on the hidden history of four stones on Waikiki Beach placed there as a tribute to four legendary mahu who first brought the healing arts from Tahiti to Hawaii. It premiered and won the Special Jury Prize at the Tribeca Film Festival and was shortlisted for an Oscar as Best Animated Short Film at the 93rd Academy Awards.\n\nHamer is a frequent guest on TV documentaries and news shows including Good Morning America, Nightline and The Oprah Winfrey Show. He is featured in the Barbara Walters' special Heaven and Bill Maher documentary Religulous, and has been profiled in Time magazine.\n\nScholarly influence\nAccording to Google Scholar, Hamer's works have been cited over 27,000 times and he has an h-index of 72 as of August 2020.\n\nBooks\n The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior (Simon and Schuster, 1994) \n Living with Our Genes: Why They Matter More Than You Think with Peter Copeland (Anchor, 1999) \n The God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired into our Genes (Doubleday, 2004)\n\nFilms\n Out in the Silence (Dir Joe Wilson, Dean Hamer, 2009).

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Ex special forces mercenary and now hardened criminal Vic, (Michael Lazar) lives in a world of cons, double crosses, crooked cops, mob bosses and drug dealing crime lords.

The casting of John Payne and Mary Murphy was announced in April 1954. Filming started 7 June 1954.

In 1561, grateful for favours he had done them, the Inner Temple admitted Dudley as their most privileged member, their \"Lord and Governor\". He was allowed to build his own apartments on the premises and organised grand festivities and performances in the Temple. As Chancellor of Oxford University Dudley was highly committed. He enforced the Thirty-nine Articles and the oath of royal supremacy at Oxford, and obtained from the Queen an incorporation by Act of Parliament for the university. Leicester was also instrumental in founding the official Oxford University Press, and \n\n condemned to death, as were his father and four brothers. His father went to the scaffold. In the Tower, Dudley's stay coincided with the imprisonment of his childhood friend, Edward and Mary's half-sister Elizabeth, who was sent there on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt's rebellion. Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554. The surviving brothers were released in the autumn; working for their release, their mother (who died in January 1555) and their brother-in-law, Henry Sidney, had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around Philip of Spain, Mary's husband. In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in a tournament held to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was \n\n he was born in 1532 as the fifth son, and possibly after the eldest daughter Mary, who became the mother of the courtier-poet Philip Sidney. The family life of John and Jane Dudley seems to have been happy and was free from any scandals; around 1535 a poem praised the \"love and devotion\" of their marriage. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 before he could draw up his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys maintained that Guildford's daughter Jane was the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court case with the assistance of Thomas Cromwell.\n\n Robert Dudley was the fifth son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane, daughter of Sir Edward Guildford. His paternal grandfather, Edmund Dudley, had been an adviser to King Henry VII and was executed for treason in 1510 by King Henry VIII. John and Jane Dudley had 13 children in all and were known for their happy family life. Among the siblings' tutors figured John Dee, Thomas Wilson, and Roger Ascham. Roger Ascham believed that Robert Dudley possessed a rare talent for languages and writing, including in Latin, regretting that his pupil had done himself harm by preferring mathematics. Robert learned the craft of the courtier at the courts of Henry VIII, and especially Edward VI, among whose companions he served. In \n\n  Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (1550-1604), was an enthusiastic and persistent promoter of theatrical companies, and was himself known as a playwright. He sponsored both adult and boys' acting companies, and it is difficult to distinguish between their performance records. He also sponsored a Christmas 1584 court performance of tumbler John Symons and his group of acrobats between his tenure with Lord Strange's Men and Queen Elizabeth's Men. Oxford’s adult playing company was formed with actors who were formerly members of the Earl of Warwick’s Men in the early 1580s during the period when noblemen were using their playing companies to promote themselves \n\nQuestion: Who is Edward De Vere, 17Th Earl Of Oxford's paternal grandfather?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was the first physician to provide a clinical description of narcolepsy and cataplexy (1877).

His son, Alexander Karl Otto Westphal (1863–1941) was also a psychiatrist, and is associated with the Westphal-Piltz syndrome (neurotonic pupillary reaction). Westphal, in addition to his multiple contributions to neurology and neuroanatomy, has been credited with introducing rational and non-censorious treatment to psychiatric hospitalization in Germany.\n\nMichel Foucault credits Westphal for the birth of the modern homosexual, with his paper published in 1870 on 'contrary sexual feeling', in which he describes two people dealing with what would later come to be known as homosexuality.

Though various remedies were tried, none proved to be effective. According to court sources, the royal couple then turned to the court physician Fernel for help in conceiving. Louis was born on 3 February 1549 at the Palace of Fontainebleau, the couple's second son and fourth child. From birth he was second in line to the throne and endowed with the duchy of Orléans. He was raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d'Humières and Françoise d'Humières, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers, and reportedly shared the same nursery with his brother and sister Francis and Elisabeth, and later with his brother Charles. Louis was present when five-year-old Mary, Queen of Scots arrived at Henry II's court to be raised as the intended bride and queen of Francis, the future king of France and king consort of Scots. There are reports that Henry II and Catherine planned for Louis to one day become the Duke of Urbino, a title which belonged exclusively to the Medici family.\n\n In 1796 Francis married his double first cousin Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, daughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. When she died, he married his first cousin María Isabella, daughter of King Charles IV of Spain. After the Bourbon family fled from Naples to Sicily in 1806, Lord William Bentinck, the British resident, had drafted a new constitution along British and French lines. Ferdinand agreed to abdicate his throne, with Francis being appointed regent in 1812. On the abdication of Napoleon I, his father returned to Naples and suppressed the Sicilian constitution, incorporating his two kingdoms into that of the Two Sicilies (1816); Francis then assumed the revived title of duke of Calabria. While still heir apparent he professed liberal ideas, \n\n  Monsieur Francis, Duke of Anjou and Alençon (Hercule François; 18 March 1555 &ndash; 10 June 1584) was the youngest son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici.\n\n Francis was born the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his wife Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria in Naples. He was also the nephew of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, the last King and Queen of France before the first French Republic. At the death of his older brother Carlo, Duke of Calabria, Francis became the heir-apparent to the throne and Duke of Calabria, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Neapolitan throne.\n\n François was born on 30 October 1535 His mother, Marie de Guise, was from the powerful French Catholic House of Guise. His father, Louis, was the son of Louis I d'Orleans, Duke of Longueville. Following his father's death and his mother's marriage to James V of Scotland, François' care was entrusted to his grandmother, Antoinette de Bourbon. Francis kept correspondence with his mother, sending her a piece of string to show how tall he was, and later his portrait. By 1550 François was ill. His mother had returned to France as part of the betrothal of his half-sister Mary to Francis, Dauphin of France. She tended him through what would be his final illness.

From 1986 to 1995, he worked for the Belgian government, as chief of staff of the deputy prime minister and various ministries. During his time in office as director in the JHA sector, he had a central role in the negotiations for Eurojust and the European arrest warrant. Since 2007, he holds the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. He was also Deputy Secretary of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union from 1999 to 2000. In addition to his administrative duties, he is also a lecturer in law at several universities in Belgium, particularly at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve, at Saint-Louis University, Brussels and the Université libre de Bruxelles (Brussels). In 1979 he married Anne del Marmol (15 April 1956) and has three children: Arnaud (1984), Thomas (1987) and Antoine (1988).\n\n Born in 1953, Rübig attended the polytechnic institute for farm machinery design in Steyr, graduating in 1972. After his military service, he studied business administration, marketing and industrial engineering at the University of Linz (1972–78). He completed his studies there with a doctorate at the Institute for Auditing, Trusteeship and Accountancy in 1984. At the same time, he worked as a lifeguard, glider and skiing instructor. He started his business career already in 1972, working in the family forging company with various general management appointments until 1996. During the course of his business career he founded companies in France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\n Cloarec began as an agricultural worker at the age of 15. When the Second World War started, he was enthused with patriotic feelings which strengthened with time. When the Germans occupied Paris and the north part of France, he left his job and travelled secretly to the southern zone, with the intention of reaching England and fighting with the Free French forces.

His elementary education started in a comprehensive primary school at Longlier, his birthplace. He served in the British Intelligence Service during the First World War, and got imprisoned in concentration camps twice. In recognition of his service, he was granted enrolment at the University of Liège in Belgium to study medicine without any formal education required for the course. He earned his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1928. Devoted to medical research, he initially joined German institutes in Berlin. In 1929 he found an opportunity to join the Rockefeller Institute in New York. At Rockefeller University he made his most groundbreaking achievements in cell biology. In 1930 he developed the technique of cell fractionation, by which he discovered the agent of the Rous sarcoma, components of cell organelles such as mitochondrion, chloroplast, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, ribosome and lysosome. He was the first to employ the electron microscope in the field of biology. In 1945 he published the first detailed structure of cell. His collective works established the complex functional and structural properties of cells.\n\nClaude served as director at Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment and Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cancérologie in Louvain-la-Neuve ; Professor at the Free University of Brussels, the University of Louvain, and Rockefeller University. For his pioneering works he received the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1970, together with George Palade and Keith Porter, the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1971, and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with his student George Palade and friend Christian de Duve.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAlbert Claude was born in 1899 (but according to civil register 1898) in Longlier, a hamlet in Neufchâteau, Belgium, to Florentin Joseph Claude and Marie-Glaudice Watriquant Claude. He was the youngest among three brothers and one sister. His father was a Paris-trained baker and run a bakery-cum-general store at Longlier valley near railroad station. His mother, who developed breast cancer in 1902, died when he was seven years old. He spent his pre-school life with his ailing mother. He started education in Longlier Primary School, a pluralistic school of single room, mixed grades, and all under one teacher. In spite of the inconveniences, he remarked the education system as \"excellent.\"  He served as a bell boy, ringing church bell every morning at 6. Due to economic depression the family moved to Athus, a prosperous region with steel mills, in 1907. He entered German-speaking school. After two years he was asked to look after his uncle who was disabled with cerebral haemorrhage in Longlier. He dropped out of school and practically nursed his uncle for several years. At the outbreak of the First World War he was apprenticed to steel mills and worked as an industrial designer. Inspired by Winston Churchill, then British Minister of War, he joined the resistance and volunteered in British Intelligence Service in which he served during the whole war. At the end of the war he was decorated with the Interallied Medal along with veteran status. He then wanted to continue education. Since he had no formal secondary education, particularly required for medicine course, such as in Greek and Latin, he tried to join School of Mining in Liège. By that time Marcel Florkin became head of the Direction of Higher Education in Belgium's Ministry of Public Instruction, and under his administration passed the law that enabled war veterans to pursue higher education without diploma or other examinations. As an honour to his war service, he was given admission to the University of Liège in 1922 to study medicine. He obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1928.\n\nCareer\n\nClaude received travel grants from Belgian government for his doctoral thesis on the transplantation of mouse cancers into rats. With this he worked his postdoctoral research in Berlin during the winter of 1928–1929, first at the Institut für Krebsforschung, and then at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Dahlem, in the laboratory of tissues culture of Prof. Albert Fischer. Back in Belgium he received fellowship in 1929 from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (Commission for Relief in Belgium, CRB) for research in the United States. He applied for the Rockefeller Institute (now the Rockefeller University) in New York, USA. Simon Flexner, then Director, accepted his proposal to work on the isolation and identification of the Rous sarcoma virus. In September 1929 he joined the Rockefeller Institute. In 1930, he discovered the process of cell fractionation, which was groundbreaking in his time. The process consists of grinding up cells to break the membrane and release the cell's contents. He then filtered out the cell membranes and placed the remaining cell contents in a centrifuge to separate them according to mass. He divided the centrifuged contents into fractions, each of a specific mass, and discovered that particular fractions were responsible for particular cell functions. In 1938 he identified and purified for the first time component of Rous sarcoma virus, the causal agent of carcinoma, as \"ribose nucleoprotein\" (eventually named RNA). He was the first to use electron microscope to study biological cells. Earlier electron microscopes were used only in physical researches. His first electron microscopic study was on the structure of mitochondria in 1945. He was given American citizenship in 1941. He discovered that mitochondria are the \"power houses\" of all cells. He also discovered cytoplasmic granules full of RNA and named them \"microsomes\", which were later renamed ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machineries of cell. With his associate, Keith Porter, he found a \"lace-work\" structure that was eventually proven to be the major structural feature of the interior of all eukaryotic cells. This was the discovery of endoplasmic reticulum (a Latin for \"fishnet\").\n\nIn 1949, he became Director of the Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (Institut Jules Bordet) and Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels, where he was Emeritus in 1971. \nIn the mid sixties during an Electron Microscopy symposium in (Bratislava)-(Czechoslovakia) organized by the (UNESCO) at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he meets young scientist Dr. Emil Mrena who was at that time head of the Electron Microscopy department. He invited him to come and work with him in Brussels, making it possible for Dr. Mrena's family to escape the communist regime. Their close collaboration gave fruition to 5 publications from 1969 to 1974.\nWith the support of his colleague and friend  Christian de Duve, he became in 1972 Professor at the University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain) and Director of the \"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cancérologie\" in Louvain-la-Neuve where he moved with Dr. Emil Mrena as sole collaborator. At the same time, he was appointed Professor at the Rockefeller University, an institution with which he had remained connected, in different degrees, since 1929.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married Julia Gilder in 1935, with whom he had a daughter Philippa. They got divorced while at Rockefeller. Philippa became a neuroscientist and married Antony Stretton.\n\nClaude was known to be a bit of an eccentric and had close friendship with painters, including Diego Rivera and Paul Delvaux, and musicians such as Edgard Varèse.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1971 from the Université libre de Bruxelles and from the directorship of the Institut Jules Bordet, he continued his research at the University of Louvain with his collaborator Dr. Emil Mrena, who ended up resigning in 1977 due to decreasing activity of the Laboratory, moving to other research works. It is said that he continued his research in seclusion until he died of natural causes, at his home in Brussels, on Sunday night on 22 May 1983, but he had stopped visiting his own laboratory in Louvain already in 1976 due to his weak health.\n\nAwards and recognitions\n\nBaron Holvoet Prize of the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique of Belgium in 1965\nLouisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1970 from Columbia University\nPaul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1971 \nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with Palade and de Duve \"for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell\" \nMedal of the Belgian Academy of Medicine\nMember of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium\nMember of the French Academy of Sciences\nHonorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nOrder of the Palmes Académiques of France\nGrand Cordon of the Order of Léopold II\nHonorary doctorates from the universities of Modena, Brno, Liège, Louvain, Gent, and the Rockefeller University.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nHis list of publications on the Institutional Repository of Université libre de Bruxelles\n\nThe Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\nBiography at biography.com\nScience Quotes by Albert Claude\nProfile at Rockefeller University\n\n1899 births\n1983 deaths\nUniversité libre de Bruxelles faculty\nBelgian biologists\nBelgian emigrants to the United States\nBelgian Nobel laureates\nRockefeller University faculty\nNobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine\nPeople from Neufchâteau, Luxembourg Province\nUniversity of Liège alumni\n20th-century biologists\nUniversité catholique de Louvain faculty\n\nAlbert Claude (24 August 1899 – 22 May 1983) was a Belgian-American cell biologist and medical doctor who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with Christian de Duve and George Emil Palade.

At the outbreak of the First World War he was apprenticed to steel mills and worked as an industrial designer. Inspired by Winston Churchill, then British Minister of War, he joined the resistance and volunteered in British Intelligence Service in which he served during the whole war. At the end of the war he was decorated with the Interallied Medal along with veteran status. He then wanted to continue education. Since he had no formal secondary education, particularly required for medicine course, such as in Greek and Latin, he tried to join School of Mining in Liège. By that time Marcel Florkin became head of the Direction of Higher Education in Belgium's Ministry of Public Instruction, and under his administration passed the law that enabled war veterans to pursue higher education without diploma or other examinations. As an honour to his war service, he was given admission to the University of Liège in 1922 to study medicine. He obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1928.\n\nCareer\n\nClaude received travel grants from Belgian government for his doctoral thesis on the transplantation of mouse cancers into rats. With this he worked his postdoctoral research in Berlin during the winter of 1928–1929, first at the Institut für Krebsforschung, and then at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Dahlem, in the laboratory of tissues culture of Prof. Albert Fischer. Back in Belgium he received fellowship in 1929 from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (Commission for Relief in Belgium, CRB) for research in the United States. He applied for the Rockefeller Institute (now the Rockefeller University) in New York, USA. Simon Flexner, then Director, accepted his proposal to work on the isolation and identification of the Rous sarcoma virus. In September 1929 he joined the Rockefeller Institute. In 1930, he discovered the process of cell fractionation, which was groundbreaking in his time. The process consists of grinding up cells to break the membrane and release the cell's contents. He then filtered out the cell membranes and placed the remaining cell contents in a centrifuge to separate them according to mass. He divided the centrifuged contents into fractions, each of a specific mass, and discovered that particular fractions were responsible for particular cell functions. In 1938 he identified and purified for the first time component of Rous sarcoma virus, the causal agent of carcinoma, as \"ribose nucleoprotein\" (eventually named RNA). He was the first to use electron microscope to study biological cells. Earlier electron microscopes were used only in physical researches. His first electron microscopic study was on the structure of mitochondria in 1945. He was given American citizenship in 1941. He discovered that mitochondria are the \"power houses\" of all cells. He also discovered cytoplasmic granules full of RNA and named them \"microsomes\", which were later renamed ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machineries of cell. With his associate, Keith Porter, he found a \"lace-work\" structure that was eventually proven to be the major structural feature of the interior of all eukaryotic cells. This was the discovery of endoplasmic reticulum (a Latin for \"fishnet\").\n\nIn 1949, he became Director of the Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (Institut Jules Bordet) and Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels, where he was Emeritus in 1971. \nIn the mid sixties during an Electron Microscopy symposium in (Bratislava)-(Czechoslovakia) organized by the (UNESCO) at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he meets young scientist Dr. Emil Mrena who was at that time head of the Electron Microscopy department. He invited him to come and work with him in Brussels, making it possible for Dr. Mrena's family to escape the communist regime. Their close collaboration gave fruition to 5 publications from 1969 to 1974.\nWith the support of his colleague and friend  Christian de Duve, he became in 1972 Professor at the University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain) and Director of the \"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Cancérologie\" in Louvain-la-Neuve where he moved with Dr. Emil Mrena as sole collaborator. At the same time, he was appointed Professor at the Rockefeller University, an institution with which he had remained connected, in different degrees, since 1929.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married Julia Gilder in 1935, with whom he had a daughter Philippa. They got divorced while at Rockefeller. Philippa became a neuroscientist and married Antony Stretton.\n\nClaude was known to be a bit of an eccentric and had close friendship with painters, including Diego Rivera and Paul Delvaux, and musicians such as Edgard Varèse.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1971 from the Université libre de Bruxelles and from the directorship of the Institut Jules Bordet, he continued his research at the University of Louvain with his collaborator Dr. Emil Mrena, who ended up resigning in 1977 due to decreasing activity of the Laboratory, moving to other research works. It is said that he continued his research in seclusion until he died of natural causes, at his home in Brussels, on Sunday night on 22 May 1983, but he had stopped visiting his own laboratory in Louvain already in 1976 due to his weak health.\n\nAwards and recognitions\n\nBaron Holvoet Prize of the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique of Belgium in 1965\nLouisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1970 from Columbia University\nPaul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1971 \nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with Palade and de Duve \"for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell\" \nMedal of the Belgian Academy of Medicine\nMember of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium\nMember of the French Academy of Sciences\nHonorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nOrder of the Palmes Académiques of France\nGrand Cordon of the Order of Léopold II\nHonorary doctorates from the universities of Modena, Brno, Liège, Louvain, Gent, and the Rockefeller University.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nHis list of publications on the Institutional Repository of Université libre de Bruxelles\n\nThe Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\nBiography at biography.com\nScience Quotes by Albert Claude\nProfile at Rockefeller University\n\n1899 births\n1983 deaths\nUniversité libre de Bruxelles faculty\nBelgian biologists\nBelgian emigrants to the United States\nBelgian Nobel laureates\nRockefeller University faculty\nNobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine\nPeople from Neufchâteau, Luxembourg Province\nUniversity of Liège alumni\n20th-century biologists\nUniversité catholique de Louvain faculty\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Marc De Clerck or Wiesław Perszke?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It follows two biker gangs, one male and one female. The male biker gang are the \"Born Losers\". They are good guys with three missions in life: Find the evil, Destroy the evil, and find a really great lite beer. Their leader, played by Paul LeMat, has visions because of a steel plate in his head. He is being studied by one of his fellow bikers from MIT. The female biker gang are the \"Women of the Wolf\". Their leader, played by Eileen Davidson, was abandoned by her parents and raised by wolves. She plans to create a new generation of fearless independent women by kidnapping baby girls and taking them to the woods to be raised by wolves. Male babies are sold on the black market. In the inevitable clash, the leader of the \"Woman of the Wolf\" must choose between the attraction she feels for the leader of the Born Losers, and the culmination of her allegedly feminist ideals. Mark Holton also appeared in the film.\n\n Kennedy wrote 13 episodes for a proposed TV series about a Mexican, which John Wayne read and tried to get financed as a vehicle for Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez through Wayne's Batjac Productions. Although the TV program was never produced, it led Kennedy to write Seven Men from Now (1956) for Batjac. It was written for Wayne, but having just completed John Ford's The Searchers, he wanted to take a break from Westerns, so it was made with Randolph Scott; Wayne later expressed regret over having passed on the film. It was directed by Budd Boetticher and was the first of what became known as the \"Ranown Cycle\". Also for Batjac, Kennedy wrote Gun the Man Down (1956) starring James Arness, and Man in the Vault (1956), a contemporary thriller. Both were directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. Kennedy also wrote The Tall T for Batjac, based on a story by Elmore Leonard. When Wayne broke up with his partner Robert Fellows, Fellows took The Tall T script and made it with Scott and Boetticher. Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reteamed on Buchanan Rides Alone (1958).\n\n The Roaming Cowboy is a 1937 American Western film directed by Robert F. Hill and written by Fred Myton. The film stars Fred Scott, Al St. John, Lois January, Forrest Taylor, Roger Williams, Richard Cramer, Buddy Cox and Art Miles. The film was released on January 4, 1937, by Spectrum Pictures. This was the first film to feature Al St. John as \"Fuzzy\" Jones, a cowboy comedy relief character who went on to appear in dozens of films, including the Producers Releasing Corporation's \"Billy the Kid\" series from 1940 to 1946, and their \"Lone Rider\" series from 1941 to 1943.\n\n Decision at Sundown is a 1957 American Western film directed by Budd Boetticher and starring Randolph Scott. It is one of seven Boetticher/Scott western collaborations, including Seven Men from Now, The Tall T, Buchanan Rides Alone, Westbound, Ride Lonesome and Comanche Station. Boetticher said this film and Westbound were the only mediocre films he made as part of the Ranown cycle.\n\n of General Electric Theater, Cimarron City, Sugarfoot, Lawman, One Step Beyond, Bronco, 77 Sunset Strip, The Detectives, and House Call.

Roberts recognized the film's classic structure; his engaging outlaw, Sam Boone, counterpoints Scott's granite-faced Ben Brigade, maintaining the tension of whether they will work together or clash.

Years pass, and this pair are blessed with two little kiddies. A villager, the father of a wayward girl, is murdered and Richard (Fenton), the brother of Carlyle's former sweetheart Barbara (Daw), is accused. Barbara makes an appointment with Carlyle to ask his help. Lady Isabel, misunderstanding, leaves her kiddies and goes with Sir Francis, who ill-treats her and finally casts her off. Returning to England, she gets in a wreck and is reported dead. Carlyle eventually marries Barbara.

Yvonne consoles her son with satisfaction as they return home. Léo however is appalled by the cruelty and selfishness of what has been done and decides to support Madeleine. The next day Léo persuades Georges, and then the more reluctant Yvonne, that the only way to rescue the inconsolable Michel is to allow him to marry Madeleine.

Jack House's book Square Mile of Murder (1961), which contains a section on Smith, formed the basis for a BBC television version in 1980. A television play based upon the case, Killer in Close-Up: The Trial Of Madeleine Smith, written by George F. Kerr, was also produced by Sydney television station ABN-2, broadcast on 13 August 1958. The case was an inspiration for Wilkie Collins' novel The Law and the Lady (1875), though the only main similar features were the problem of the Scottish \"Not Proven\" verdict and arsenic poisoning as a means for murder.

Many of his songs tend to deal with religious or apocalyptic themes, due to his Christian upbringing. Lawless has stated in recent interviews that he has returned to the Christian faith and considers himself a born-again Christian. Lawless cites influences which include AC/DC, Black Sabbath, the Beatles, Kiss, and Alice Cooper. His stage theatrics were influenced by Alice Cooper and Kiss, and he often imitated Gene Simmons and/or Paul Stanley very closely during his performances. W.A.S.P. was no stranger to controversy, and Lawless found himself defending heavy metal music against a cadre of politicians (and their wives) in the mid-80s. But beyond headlines and drama, W.A.S.P. enjoyed their biggest run of success during this period, releasing several singles over three albums from 1985 to 1988, the best known of these being \"L.O.V.E. Machine\", \"I Wanna Be Somebody\", and \"Wild Child\". W.A.S.P. was also heavily under scrutiny specifically for their single, \"Animal (F**k Like a Beast)\", led by P.M.R.C. lyric watchdogs.\n\n \"Animal (F**k Like a Beast)\" is a song by American heavy metal band W.A.S.P. It was originally intended to be the opening track on their self-titled 1984 debut album, but was dropped before the album's release, although it appears as a bonus track on the 1998 reissue. Written by Blackie Lawless, the song was released as the band's first single. In the United States, the song was first released in a live version in 1988. The studio version was available in that region only in 1998, on the reissue of W.A.S.P.'s debut album, which omitted the asterisks used to censor the title originally.\n\n Recorded in early 1984, the debut single intended for the self-titled album of W.A.S.P. was close to not being released at all after being dropped from the album. Deemed too controversial, Capitol Records did not want to risk the album being banned from major retail chains. The record company had subsequent plans to release the single only in Europe, in a black plastic bag and with a warning sticker about the explicit lyrics. Capitol backed out at the last minute and the single was shelved until the band was able to strike a one-off publishing deal with the independent label Music For Nations. The single was finally released in April 1984, complete with the original sleeve and art depicting a codpiece and a circular saw blade.\n\n toured the United States several times, making its second tour in support of Scatterbrain, and later opening for former Black Sabbath lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne.

Later in the year, the song would be used in the movie Wayne's World. As Ugly As They Wanna Be went on to sell over one million copies in the U.S. alone.\n\n to Hide\" was the album's first single. The single features \"Proud\", a song that would later be included on the soundtrack for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

Though the story is set in upstate New York, it was filmed in Mission, British Columbia. The set design involved the creation of an entire riverside town, with a budget of CDN $2.5 million for the set alone being the largest for a film produced in Canada to that date.\n\n The Bitter Ash is a Canadian drama film, directed by Larry Kent and released in 1963. One of the first narrative feature films ever shot in Vancouver, the film stars Alan Scarfe as Des, an unhappy blue collar man who is drawn into the city's counterculture underground, where he clashes with bohemian intellectual Colin (Philip Brown) over the affections of Colin's wife Laurie (Lynn Stewart). Kent made the film while he was a student at the University of British Columbia, and the film was acted primarily by university drama students rather than professional actors. The film was controversial at the time because it depicted sexual activity, brief nudity, profanity and drug use. Unable to secure commercial distribution, King exhibited the film by personally undertaking a cross-Canada tour to screen it on university campuses. The film has often been characterized by critics as an exploitation \n\n Born and raised in Los Angeles, Roth began his tertiary education at the University of California, Berkeley studying philosophy and creative writing before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in Cinema at the University of Southern California in 1972.

As Xu Zhigao was then serving as the junior regent, in control of the Wu imperial government at the capital Guangling (廣陵, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) with Xu Wen himself stationed at Jinling (金陵, i.e., Sheng Prefecture), Lady Song was created the Lady of Guangping, and later the greater title of Lady of Jin.

For example, in winter 515, the corrupt governor of Qi Province (岐州, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Yuan Mi (元謐) the Prince of Zhao, provoked a popular uprising when he killed several people without reason, and while he was relieved from his post, as soon as he returned to the capital Luoyang, Empress Dowager Hu made him a minister because his wife was her niece.

The emperor did not want other wives or concubines because he is said to have loved her sincerely.

Yuxiong (鬻熊), the progenitor of Chu, was the tutor of King Wen of Zhou and died during his reign. After Zhou overthrew the Shang Dynasty, Yuxiong's descendants took Xiong as their clan name and remained prominent at court. King Wen's grandson King Cheng of Zhou ( reigned 1042 – 1021 BC) awarded Yuxiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi the hereditary title of zǐ (, roughly \"viscount\") and the fiefdom of Chu.

Her goal was to focus on friendship, sorority, and the special bond that is formed between girls. Sciamma is frequently asked why she wrote and directed a film about a gang of young French black girls, seeing that she is white. Celine stated, \"I had a strong sense of having lived on the outskirts – even if I am middle-class white girl.

This increase in resources lead to a significant demographic growth in Lilkovo in the first half of the 20th century with a population exceeding 1000 people in the 1940s. However, a steady decline in the population of the village can be observed since the middle of the 20th century: As of 15 June 2020, there are only 21 people with a permanent address in Lilkovo. One of the possible events that triggered the process of depopulation in the mid 1940s was the collectivization in the agricultural sector, which left many people without lands and in a state of insecurity. During the industrialization in Bulgaria (1944 - 1989) many of them migrated to the cities in search of employment. Despite the low number of permanent residents, the village comes to life during the summer months when the hundreds of homes - both old stone houses and modern summer homes - get filled with people looking to escape from the heat and to enjoy the beautiful mountain landscapes.\n\n  The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance. EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece. By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES had roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA had under 10,000 men. To combat the rising influence of the EAM, and fearful of an eventual takeover after the German defeat, in 1943, Ioannis Rallis, the Prime Minister of the collaborationist government, authorised the creation of paramilitary forces, known as the Security Battalions.

It is located in the municipal unit of Tymfi in the northern part of the regional unit of Ioannina. According to a local legend, the village was founded as Rasciana, on the river of the same name. However, that site was abandoned because of a lack of drinking water, and the inhabitants scattered to found Iliochori and the nearby town of Laista (ancient Lisinitza). Iliochori was traditionally an agricultural village, with husbandry and cultivation of barley and vetch being among its primary areas of economic activity. Viticulture was also prominent, and the village produced a wine, Dobrovino, that gave it its original name. Caravans leaving from Iliochori carried products from the region to the Balkans for trade. The town suffered severe damage in both World War II and the Greek Civil War and lost a large portion of its population during the 1940s as a result.\n\n The village is situated on the foothill of Mount Giona, the highest mountain of Southern Greece, on the site that the ancient town existed. It is about 8.5 km SW of the prefecture's capital, Amfissa, to which it is connected by the recently reconstructed GR-48.

Smith was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and became a comedian active in the vaudeville era. He met his wife Alice Howell in 1910 and the two performed together as Howell and Howell. After working under direction of Mack Sennett at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in New York City, Smith moved to Los Angeles, California. Smith and his wife starred in reels together produced by L-KO Kompany. While Howell was contracted at Universal Studios, Smith directed her in films described in the book Clown Princes and Court Jesters as, \"some of Universal's most memorable comedies of the twenties\". With colleague Vin Moore, Smith directed actor Oliver Hardy in the 1920 film Distilled Love. Smith directed the Marx Brothers in 1921 in their first film, titled Humor Risk, which has since been lost. In 1925, Smith's directing work included films starring Bert Roach, Neely Edwards, and Charles Puffy. His contributions at Universal included a series of comedy films called \"The Collegians\".\n\n In a split screen, a man dressed in a black suit and tie (Daniel Cockburn) speaks directly to the audience, while a black and white home movie is being projected next to him, on the left. He describes a dream in which he was asked to read a eulogy for his father. As he does so, the projectionist on the left hand side (Daniel Cockburn) is cutting the film with scissors. Watching his father (Daniel Cockburn) in the home movie, he realizes that the gestures his father made are a kind of prison; he is forced to repeat them involuntarily. Then the man in black looks on with the horror of recognition, realizing that his father's body language \"prefigured all the gestures into which I would later grow, thinking they were my own.\" In a dream, the man returns to his father's bedside. \n\n A critic from the Mirror described the film as \"a good picture, and is nearer to the American style of production than any other Australian film I have seen. The settings, though plain, look well and add to the general value.\" The Motion Picture News said the author \"deserves credit for developing an old plot in an entirely new way... the battle scenes, though not elaborate, are convincing and are perhaps the most realistic of any subject yet made in Australia. The settings, direction and photography are of high class order.\" The Moving Picture World called it \"a very poor production, and not up to the standard set by some home-made productions lately. The chief fault is in the story, as the acting, photography  and direction leave little to be desired. The settings are also particularly good.\" Punch said that \"the Australian parts of the photo play are slight\" but the war sequences were \"realistic\".\n\n Director Jean-Jacques Annaud once told Umberto Eco that he was convinced the book was written for only one person to direct: himself. He felt personally intrigued by the project and other things because of a lifelong fascination with medieval churches and a great familiarity with Latin and Greek. Annaud spent four years preparing the film, traveling throughout the United States and Europe, searching for the perfect multi-ethnic cast with interesting and distinctive faces. He resisted suggestions to cast Sean Connery for the part of William because he felt the character, who was already an amalgam of Sherlock Holmes and William of Occam, would become too overwhelming with \"007\" added. Later, after Annaud failed to find another actor he liked for the part, he was won over by Connery's reading, but Eco was \n\n David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, television director, visual artist, musician and occasional actor. Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences. Lynch's oeuvre encompasses work in both cinema and television. His films include The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, The Straight Story, and perhaps his most critically successful film, 2001's Mulholland Drive; whilst his television debut, Twin Peaks, earned five Emmy Award nominations for its first season.

Although two of Joseph's daughters married, in exile, nephews of Napoleon I, when their dynasty was restored to power in France in December 1851, the man who soon became emperor as Napoleon III was the only living, legally legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte, former King of Holland. In December 1852, with the imperial crown on his head, Napoleon III, still a bachelor, exercised the authority granted him by a decree in the form of a Sénatus-consulte, and confirmed by plebecite, to enact a \n\nCarlo Buonaparte (1746–1785) ; [[Image:Simple silver crown.svg|15px]] Napoleon I (1769–1821) ; [[Image:Simple silver crown.svg|15px]] Napoleon II (1811–1832) ; Louis Bonaparte (1778–1846) ; [[Image:Simple gold crown.svg|15px]] Napoleon III (born 1808) ; (1) Napoléon, Prince Imperial (b. 1856) ; Jérôme Bonaparte (1784–1860) ; (2) Napoléon Joseph, Prince Français (b. 1822) ; (3) Napoléon Victor Jérôme Frédéric, Prince Français (b. 1862) ; (4) Napoléon Louis Joseph Jérôme, Prince Français (b. 1864) \n\n father's will for divorcing her and remarrying a commoner without paternal permission. His heir apparent (recognized by some as head of the House of Bonaparte since 1997) is his son, Jean-Christophe Napoléon. There are no surviving descendants in the legitimate male line of any of Napoleon's brothers except Jérôme. This branch of the House of Bonaparte is recognized by Bonapartists as Napoleon I's dynastic heirs, being excluded from residence in France or service in its military by law, along with the heads of the House of Orléans, between 1883 and 1950. The head and dynastic members of the family bear the title of Prince with the name Napoléon (Bonaparte) and the style of Imperial Highness.\n\n Charles, Prince Napoléon (born 1950, great-great-grandson of Jérôme Bonaparte by his second marriage), and his son Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon (born 1986 and appointed heir in the will of his grandfather Louis, Prince Napoléon) currently dispute the headship of the Bonaparte family. The only other male member of the family is Charles's recently married (2013) brother, Prince Jérôme Napoléon (born 1957). There are no other legitimate descendants in the male line from Napoleon I or from his brothers. There are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate but unacknowledged son, Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868), born from Napoleon I's union with Marie, Countess Walewski. A descendant of Napoleon's sister Caroline Bonaparte was actor René Auberjonois. Recent DNA-matches with living descendants of Jérôme and Count Walewski have confirmed the existence of descendants of Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, namely the Clovis family.\n\n Napoléon, Prince Imperial (Napoléon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph Bonaparte; 16 March 1856 – 1 June 1879), also known as Louis-Napoléon, was the only child of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and Empress Eugénie. After his father was dethroned in 1870, he moved with his family to England. On his father's death in January 1873, he was proclaimed by the Bonapartist faction as Napoleon IV. In England, he trained as a soldier. Keen to see action, he persuaded the British to allow him to participate in the Anglo-Zulu War. In 1879, serving with British forces, he was killed in a skirmish with a group of Zulus. His early death sent shockwaves throughout Europe, as he was the last serious dynastic hope for the restoration of the House of Bonaparte to the throne of France.\n\nQuestion: When is Prince Napoléon Bonaparte's father's birthday?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For the 1971 musical Follies, a show about a reunion of performers from a musical revue set between the World Wars, Stephen Sondheim wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and George Gershwin but also the lyrics of writers such as Ira Gershwin, Dorothy Fields, Otto Harbach, and Oscar Hammerstein II. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song \"Losing My Mind\" sung in the show contains \"near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies\" from the Gershwins' \"The Man I Love\" and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields. Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including Gypsy, Saturday Night, Assassins, and Anyone Can Whistle.\n\n James Lapine ; \"Finishing the Hat\" ; \"Sunday\" ; \"Beautiful\" ; Into the Woods (1987), book by James Lapine ; \"Children Will Listen\" ; \"Ever After\" ; Assassins (1990), book by John Weidman ; \"Something Just Broke\" ; \"The Gun Song\" ; Passion (1994), book by James Lapine ; \"Fosca’s Entrance (I Read)\" ; \"Is This What You Call Love?\" ; \"Loving You\" ; \"Happiness\" ; Road Show (2008), book by John Weidman, formerly titled Bounce (2003) ; \"Talent\" ; \"The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened\" \"Invocation\"/\"Forget War\" (from The Frogs/A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum) (1974/1962) (\"Sondheim On Sondheim\" Company) ; \"Love Is \n\n The composers' backgrounds are in a variety of genres including classical, jazz, and rock, although the majority of the songs were written by contemporary classical composers.

Conan's early life as a slave and gladiator in the movie borrows heavily from Kull's origin story and only shares minor details with Conan's literary origins; Conan was never a slave or a gladiator in Howard's stories, and left Cimmeria on his own will.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released more recently, Gaza Ghetto or Kull The Conqueror?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Ida Husted Harper. Published in six volumes from 1881 to 1922, it is a history of the women's suffrage movement, primarily in the United States. Its more than 5700 pages are the major source for primary documentation about the women's suffrage movement from its beginnings through the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which enfranchised women in the U.S. in 1920. Written from the viewpoint of the wing of the movement led by Stanton and Anthony, its coverage of rival groups and individuals is limited. Realizing that the project was unlikely to make a profit, Anthony used money from a bequest in 1885 to buy the rights from the other authors and also the plates from the publisher of the two volumes that had already been issued. As sole owner, she published the books herself and donated many copies to libraries and people of influence. In her will, Anthony bequeathed the plates for all the volumes together with the existing inventory to the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\n Ladies' Home Journal was an American magazine published by the Meredith Corporation. It was first published on February 16, 1883, and eventually became one of the leading women's magazines of the 20th century in the United States. From 1891 it was published in Philadelphia by the Curtis Publishing Company. In 1903, it was the first American magazine to reach one million subscribers. In the late 20th century, changing tastes and competition from television caused it to lose circulation. Sales of the magazine ensued as the publishing company struggled. On April 24, 2014, Meredith announced it would stop publishing the magazine as a monthly with the July issue, stating it was \"transitioning Ladies' Home Journal to a special interest publication\". It was then available quarterly on newsstands only, though its website remained in operation. The last issue was published in 2016. Ladies' Home Journal was one of the Seven Sisters, as a group of women's service magazines were known. The name was derived from the Greek myth of the \"seven sisters\", also known as the Pleiades.\n\n The Woman's Viewpoint was a woman's magazine founded in Texas in 1923 and published by Florence M. Sterling. The magazine was progressive and ran from 1923 to 1927.\n\n Sterling founded the Woman's Viewpoint in Houston, and was the owner. She quit her position at the Humble Oil Company in order to devote herself to the magazine full-time. The Woman's Viewpoint had an all-female staff and began publication as a weekly serial in December 1923. The editorial staff members included Ola Harris Beaubien, Katherine Allen Lively and Mrs. Eric Tarrant Davis. Regular columns and features of the magazine were meant to be of interest to women and included advice on caring for children, fashion, a shopping guide, health and beauty advice and entertainment columns. Other articles were political in nature and encouraged women to vote. It was important to Sterling that women had a voice, saying, \"No man on earth can give a woman's viewpoint.\" Dorothy Scarborough's autobiographical novel, The Unfair Sex, was published as a serial in the Woman's Viewpoint. Grace Coolidge, then First Lady of the United States, also contributed an article in 1925. The magazine later became published semi-monthly and then monthly, with an increase of pages from 22 to 90. Sterling moved the magazine to Albany in March 1926.\n\n The Century Magazine was an illustrated monthly magazine first published in the United States in 1881 by The Century Company of New York City, which had been bought in that year by Roswell Smith and renamed by him after the Century Association.

Sir Henry Bourchier Wrey, 9th Baronet, the Rector at Tawstock, and, his first wife, the former Ellen Maria Toke, who were first cousins. He had two siblings, the Rev. Bourchier William Toke Wrey (the Curate at Warmsworth who married Anne Caroline Crosthwait, daughter of Thomas Crosthwait) and Anna Maria Toke Wrey (who married Very Rev. Isaac Morgan Reeves, Dean of Ross, Ireland). After his mother's death in 1864, his father remarried to Jane Lamb (a daughter of Humble Lamb), in 1865. His paternal grandparents were Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet and the former Anne Osborne (a daughter of John Osborne). His maternal grandparents were Nicholas Roundell Toke and Anna Maria Wrey (a daughter of Sir Bourchier Wrey, 6th Baronet). Wrey matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in November 1846 and graduated in 1851.\n\n George Willoughby, 7th Baron Willoughby of Parham (1638–1674) was an English peer of the House of Lords. He was born at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, England on 18 March 1639, the son of William Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby of Parham and Anne Carey. On 9 October 1666, he married Elizabeth Clinton, daughter of Henry Clinton and Jane Markham. George and Elizabeth had three children: John Willoughby, 8th Baron Willoughby of Parham, his successor; Anne, who died in infancy; and Elizabeth, who married Hon.

From his son Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham, descended a senior male line that went extinct on the death of Charles Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby of Parham in 1679. At the time, the male line of Sir Ambroise Willoughby, the second son of the 2nd Baron, was wrongly thought to be extinct though Henry Willoughby, a grandson of Sir Ambrose, was still living in the Colony of Virginia. Thus, in 1680 a grandson of the 2nd Baron via his fifth son, Sir Thomas, was summoned to Parliament as Thomas Willoughby, 11th Baron \n\n Francis Willoughby was born in perhaps late 1613 (since he was baptised in 1614) to William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland of Nottingham at Parham in Suffolk. His father died in 1617, and the barony was held by his older brother Henry for one year until he too died barely five years old, at which point Francis inherited the seat in the House of Lords and with it the family title. As tensions between the king and Parliament grew in the 1630s, he found himself opposed to Charles I over the levying of ship money. His loyalty was further strained by the Bishops' Wars, in which he was reluctant to fight the Scots.\n\n  Christopher, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Jenney, of Knottishall Knt, and gave the estate of Parham, Suffolk to his second son, Sir Christopher Willoughby who married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Talbois and it was their son William Willoughby who was created 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham and was Lieutenant of Calais. He married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Sir Thomas Heneage. Their son was Charles, Lord Willoughby, who married Margaret, daughter of Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. Their male descendants continued to be titled Baron Willoughby of Parham until 1779. Between 1680 and 1690, Parham Hall, formerly the property and residence of the Lords Willoughby of Parham, was purchased by the family of Corrance of Rendlesham.\n\nQuestion: Who is Charles Willoughby, 10Th Baron Willoughby Of Parham's paternal grandmother?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was also the Duke of Limburg from 1849 until the abolition of the duchy in 1866. William was the son of King William II and Anna Pavlovna of Russia. On the abdication of his grandfather William I in 1840, he became the Prince of Orange. On the death of his father in 1849, he succeeded as king of the Netherlands. William married his cousin \n\n Hesse-Kassel. In 1803, Landgrave William was created His Royal and Serene Highness The Prince-Elector of Hesse. In 1807 his electorate was annexed by the Kingdom of Westphalia, ruled by Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother. William escaped to Denmark with his family and lived there in exile until the French were expelled from Germany. Following the defeat of the Napoleonic armies in the Battle of Leipzig, William was restored in 1813. He was a member of the Tugendbund, a quasi-Masonic secret society founded after the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in June 1808 at Koningsberg. Several other prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire had been recognized as kings at \n\n  Prince George William of Hesse-Darmstadt (11 July 1722 &ndash; 21 June 1782) was a Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was born in Darmstadt. He was the second son of Landgrave Louis VIII and Charlotte Christine Magdalene Johanna of Hanau-Lichtenberg. From 1738 till his death he commanded an army-regiment of his land. In the 1740s, he also commanded a Prussian regiment. He reached the rank of general of the cavalry. He was the official military adviser to his father, but had a strong rival in his older brother Louis IX, who followed his friend's example, the soldier-king Frederick II of Prussia and expanded Pirmasens as a garrison town. In 1748, he married Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Falkenburg. Through this marriage, he acquired the estates of Broich, Oberstein, Aspermont, Burgel and Reipolzkirchen. He and Maria had nine children. In 1764, George William received Old Palace in Darmstadt and the associated pleasure garden as a gift from his father, who had always favoured him above his brother Louis. George William had the palace with the White Tower expanded. He represented the reigning family in Darmstadt, as his brother stayed mostly in Pirmasens.\n\n William I, Elector of Hesse (Wilhelm I., Kurfürst von Hessen; 3 June 1743 – 27 February 1821) was the eldest surviving son of Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) and Princess Mary of Great Britain, the daughter of George II.\n\n Prince William was born on 3 June 1743 in Kassel, capital of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel in the Holy Roman Empire. Born into the House of Hesse, he was the second but eldest surviving son of Prins Frederick of Hesse-Kassel (the future Landgrave Frederick II), and his wife Princess Mary of Great Britain. A former heir to the landgraviate, also named William, had died in infancy in 1742; therefore, hopes were high for the future of the new heir apparent. He had two younger brothers: Prince Charles and Prince Frederick. His father's marriage with the British princess was not a happy one, and Frederick abandoned the family in 1747 and converted to Catholicism in 1749. In 1755 he formally annulled his marriage. William's grandfather, Landgrave William, granted the newly acquired county of Hanau to his daughter-in-law and grandsons. Technically, young William became the reigning prince of Hanau, while under his mother's regency. The young prince William, together with his two younger brothers, lived with their mother, the landgravine Mary. From 1747 they were supported by Protestant relatives and moved to Denmark. There they lived with Mary's sister, Louise of Great Britain, and her family; Louise died in 1751.\n\nQuestion: Who is the paternal grandmother of Prince William Of Hesse-Kassel?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although he praised the late Meet the Press host Tim Russert in the past, O'Reilly criticized Russert for what he saw as a misinterpretation of what were seen as potentially racially insensitive comments by former President Bill Clinton. In his comments, Russert challenged Senator Hillary Clinton about her husband's remarks regarding Senator Barack Obama, when Mr. Clinton referred to Obama's position on Iraq as a \"fairy tale.\" O'Reilly said that Russert \"should have known better\" and realized the former President's comments were regarding Obama's Iraq policy and not his entire candidacy.\n\n the Press, and host Tim Russert challenged Broussard's account of the tragedy on the basis that his anecdote about the woman in the nursing home contained factual discrepancies noted in the MSNBC story. Broussard did not directly account for those discrepancies, repeating the statement that \"this gentleman's mother died on that Friday before I came on the show.\" In his subsequent remarks, though, he said that:  Broussard has never acknowledged making an error in his original appearance though he did give this response:  To date, Broussard's comments with regard to the federal government have not been formally addressed. Broussard was also excluded from the formal investigation conducted into the response to Hurricane Katrina and thus was not called to explain his role in the $3 billion of flood damage to the East Bank of Jefferson Parish.\n\n One of many of Whelan's career successes was of his former \"protege\", NBC's Meet the Press, Tim Russert. Whelan befriended Russert when the Buffalo native had just returned to Buffalo in 1972 after he graduated from John Carroll University. At Whelan's initiative, Russert was hired in the office, of then, City Comptroller; George D. O'Connell. During Russert's law school years, Whelan secured summer employment for him. In 1977, Russert was hired as the first Buffalo Office Manager for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at Whelan's recommendation. As Western New York's coordinator of Moynihan's first campaign, Whelan saw to it that Russert was closely involved in the inner-workings of the campaign. From there Russert moved on his own to his successes with Governor Mario Cuomo, NBC News, and later as host of NBC's \"Meet the Press\". They remained close friends until Russert's death in 2008.\n\n On Saturday, June 14, 2008, Lauer and Brokaw anchored a special edition entitled \"Remembering Tim Russert\", following the death of the Meet the Press moderator and NBC Washington Bureau Chief the previous day. Andrea Mitchell, David Gregory, Pete Williams, Lisa Myers, Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer, This Week host George Stephanopoulos, and Vice President Dick Cheney, among others, appeared onToday and gave tributes to Russert and shared stories of his life and career. On Thursday, June 19, Lauer, Vieira, Curry, and Roker broadcast from the network's Washington bureau ahead of Russert's funeral and memorial service. Natalie Morales remained in Studio 1A and took over at 8:30am, along with Amy Robach.\n\n The stretch of highway outside Ralph Wilson Stadium along U.S. Route 20A in Orchard Park, New York, has been named the Timothy J.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Sister My Sister is a 1994 film starring British actresses Julie Walters, Joely Richardson, and Jodhi May.

The only son of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and his wife Arabella, he was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, receiving a MA from the latter on 30 June 1813. He was appointed High Steward of Stratford-on-Avon, and was commissioned a captain of the local militia on 27 April 1813. On 26 July 1813, he was made lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Sevenoaks and Bromley battalion of militia. However, he died in February 1815, of a fall from his horse while hunting on Killiney Hill in County Dublin. He had no children, so he was succeeded as duke by his cousin Charles Sackville-Germain.

He was succeeded by the Duke of Abercorn as Lord Steward in 2001. He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1992 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1994. He retired in 1999 and did not stand for election as a hereditary peer after the House of Lords Act.\n\n Brought up with his elder brother Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland (1528–1572), he took part as a youth in border warfare, and on Queen Mary's accession was appointed governor of Tynemouth Castle. He was returned to the House of Commons in 1554 as Member of Parliament for Morpeth, Northumberland, was knighted in 1557, and became deputy warden of the east and middle marches. Queen Elizabeth continued him in his chief offices.

For Sharkey, the animal rights message is combined with a story about activism; \"both narrative threads are compelling\", she suggested, in this \"finely wrought\" documentary. Though David DeWitt, writing for The New York Times, suggested that he could not \"imagine anyone not feeling moved during\" Ghosts in Our Machine, he worried that McArthur may appear \"extreme\" to some viewers. Similarly, John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter argued that \"The moodily subjective work is best suited to viewers who already share most if not all of subject Jo-Anne McArthur's values; despite its obvious aesthetic appeal, its commercial value seems limited to niche bookings and special-event screenings for the activist community.\"\n\n The Ghosts in Our Machine follows photojournalist and animal activist Jo-Anne McArthur. The documentary opens with images of animals and sound bites on animal rights, before McArthur introduces herself. She describes herself as a war photographer and activist, more concerned with changing the world than with art. She meets with representatives of Redux Pictures—though they are supportive, they express doubts about her work being published—and then has dinner with a group, one of whom, Martin Rowe, offers to be an editor for her photobook.

Her previous films, including Water on the Table, about the right to water and the struggle to protect it from the free market, had been \"human-centric\", focused on human rights and environmental themes, and she intended to also \"turn [her] gaze and commitment to the plight of animals used for human profit: the billions of ghosts used in the machine of our modern world\". She was inspired to focus on the suffering of animals by Lorena Elke, her partner, a vegan and animal activist; \n\n McArthur was the \"main human subject\" of the 2013 documentary film The Ghosts in Our Machine, directed by Liz Marshall. The film avoids the shocking imagery of many documentaries focused on animal rights, such as Earthlings, meaning that it \"takes an almost arthouse approach, resulting in a film that's more a meditation on suffering and the relationship between humans and other species, than an angry, didactic diatribe\". Writing in Variety, the critic Peter Debruge said that \"It's enough to make you sad, not for the animals (to whom human cruelty is nothing new), but for McArthur, this beautiful young woman who feels so deeply for those not of her kind that she carries their collective suffering around with her daily.

His father was a nephew of Marie Victoire de Noailles, daughter-in-law of Louis XIV of France, and his paternal grandmother, Françoise Charlotte d'Aubigné, was a niece of Madame de Maintenon. He was in the army for a period. However, his eminence as a chemist gained him the election as a member of the Académie des sciences in 1777. He was also a Knight of Golden Fleece. He became Duc d'Ayen in 1766 on his grandfather's death, and Duc de Noailles on his father's in 1793. Having emigrated in 1792, he lived in Switzerland until the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, when he took his seat as a Peer of France.\n\n Henry's father was Francis I of France, the patron of Leonardo da Vinci and a member of the Valois-Angoulême branch of the House of Valois. His maternal grandfather was Louis XII of France, the conqueror of the Neapolitan Kingdom of Naples and the Duchy of Milan. Both Kings of France were descendants (in the male line) of Charles V, King of France, and as such represented, as the only extant line of the House of Valois, the descent of Charles, Count of Valois, fourth son of King Philip III of France, from the House of Capet. Henry's maternal grandmother was Anne of Brittany, the defiant Duchess Regent of Brittany and Queen of France twice over. Her grandmother was Eleanor of Navarre, the daughter of John II of Aragon and half-sister of Ferdinand II of Aragon. Therefore, this made Henry a distant half-cousin of his son-in-law Philip II of Spain. This also made him a second cousin once-removed of his other son-in-law, Henry IV of France, who was also a distant cousin through their common male-line ancestor, St. Louis of France.\n\n son of Madame de Montespan, resigned the Duchy of Antin and gave it to his grandson who was fifteen at the time. On 29 October 1722, he married Françoise Gillonne de Montmorency (1704–1768), a granddaughter of François Henri de Montmorency, Duke of Luxembourg and Marshal of France. The couple had four children, one son (born in 1727) and three daughters. His son never married and died in Breme during the Seven Years' War. His youngest daughter married into the Uzès family, one of the most senior peers in France, ranking immediately after the Princes of the Blood (legitimate male-line descendants of the ruling House of Bourbon). Louis's mother was remarried \n\n Adalbero came from one of the leading families in the area. He was a son of Wigeric, Count palatine of Lotharingia by the Count's marriage to Cunigunda, ancestors of the powerful Ardennes-Verdun dynasty. Adelbero's older brother was Frederick I, Count of Bar and Duke of Upper Lorraine. Another brother was Sigfried, Count of Ardennes. His mother, Cunigunda, was a granddaughter of Louis II of France, and therefore a descendant of Charlemagne. La Vita Johannis Gorziensis, written in 980, indicates that he was of royal descent through both his paternal and maternal lines, though the text spells out that the connection went back \"several\" generations.\n\n She was a daughter of John II, Count of Vendôme and Isabelle de Beauvau. Her maternal grandparents were Louis de Beauvau, Seneschal of Anjou and Marguerite de Chambley. Her paternal grandparents were Louis, Count of Vendôme and Jeanne of Laval. Louis had served as both Grand Chamberman of France and Grand Master of France.

Agnes died, childless, on 6 April 1448, eight years after her marriage to Charles, aged only about twenty-six. After her death, the prince took a mistress, Brianda de Vaca, and by her had an illegitimate son, born about 1449. He wished to remarry, and a possibility which was canvassed was a match with Isabella of Scotland (1426–1494), the widow of Francis I, Duke of Brittany, after he died on 18 July 1450, but this was opposed by Charles VII of France. A match was then agreed between Charles and the Infanta Catherine of Portugal (1436–1463), daughter of King Edward I, but the marriage was delayed and had not taken place when Charles died in 1461. Charles left three illegitimate children by three different mistresses: \n\n during archeological exploration of the couvent des Célestins in 1847, were identified as being those of Anne, thanks to a plaque bearing her name. In 1853, these remains were re-buried in the grave of her grandfather, Philip the Bold, in Saint Bégnine cathedral in Dijon. Anne's death signified the beginning of one of two disastrous trends in Lancastrian history. The next year, John remarried to Jacquetta of Luxembourg. For various political reasons, this alienated Anne's brother, Duke Philip. Relations between John and Philip became cool, leading to the 1435 peace negotiations between Burgundy and Charles VII, the exiled king of France. Later that year, Philip formally broke the alliance with England.\n\nCharles IV, Holy Roman Emperor ; Bonne of Bohemia, first wife of John II of France ; Margaret of Bohemia, wife of Henry XIV, Duke of Bavaria ; John Henry, Margrave of Moravia Anne and her twin sister Elisabeth were born in 1323 in the small Bavarian border town of Cham, where their mother, Elisabeth of Bohemia, was living in exile. John financially supported his wife and daughters during their exile. Her mother returned to Bohemia in 1325 with Anne (the younger Elizabeth having died in 1324), but never regained her health after the return, dying from tuberculosis in 1330. Anne was a younger sister of: After his wife's death John married Beatrice of Bourbon. They had two children, Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg, and Bonne, who died young.\n\n Anne suffered two failed betrothals before her marriage. The first was to Ladislaus of Hungary, son of Charles I of Hungary and Elisabeth of Poland, but Ladislaus died in 1329. If Ladislaus had survived and the pair had married, Anne could have become Queen of Hungary. She was then betrothed to Louis VI the Roman. This betrothal ended because Louis's father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, could have been excommunicated by the Pope. Anne was eventually married on 16 February 1335, to Otto, Duke of Austria. This was a second marriage for Otto; his first wife, Elizabeth of Bavaria, had died after bearing him two sons. Anne was seven years old at the time. The marriage lasted for eight years and resulted in a closer alliance between Anne's father and the Holy Roman Emperor, but Anne died at the age of fifteen in 1338, long before she and Otto could have children. Otto followed her in death shortly thereafter and was succeeded by his sons from his first marriage to Elisabeth of Bavaria.\n\nOn 19 May 1440, he married Catherine of France (1428–1446), daughter of Charles VII of France and Marie of Anjou.

The marriage was, however, a happy one, and produced his only child, Mary of Burgundy, on 13 February 1457. ; On 3 July 1468, Charles married Anne's sister, Margaret of York (1446–1503); her siblings also included Edward IV of England, George, Duke of Clarence, and Richard III of England.

They had one surviving child, Philip, who would be for much of his brief life Duke of Burgundy (by inheriting the title from his grandfather). Following the death of her husband, Joan married John II of France on 13 February 1350; she became Queen consort of France in the following year. This was a second marriage for them both, John's first wife, Bonne of Bohemia, had died of Black Death and had left John with eight children, so there was little pressure for Joan to give birth to a son and heir. Joan's son, Philip became a ward of the King. She had three children with King John, two girls and an unnamed son, all of whom died young. Joan died in 1360. Her possessions were inherited by her son.\n\n Upon her father's death in 1303, with her only brother Robert disinherited by the Treaty of Vincennes (1295), the County of Burgundy was inherited by Joan under the regency of her mother. When she married in 1307, her mother continued to govern her domains for her during her absence. After her husband's death in 1322, Joan lived in her own domains. The death of her spouse dealt her a devastating blow from which she never recovered, sinking into a deep depression for the rest of her life.

With Joan II's death, the County and Duchy of Burgundy became united through this marriage. The Counties of Burgundy and Artois were eventually inherited by her younger daughter Margaret in 1361. Joan left provision in her will for the founding of a college in Paris; it was named Collège de Bourgogne, \"Burgundy College.\"\n\n Joan's maternal grandparents were Philip III of Navarre and Joan II of Navarre.

After the death of Philip, Blanche retired to Neaufles-Saint-Martin near Gisors in Normandy. In 1370, Joan was betrothed to Infante John, Duke of Girona, son and heir of Peter IV of Aragon. The marriage contract was signed 16 July 1370. The following year Joan departed from France and set off to marry John in Aragon. However, Joan died on 16 September 1371 in Béziers, whilst travelling to meet her future husband. He accused the midwife Bonanada of having caused her death by use of sorcery.

On March 15, a representative from the company stated she would be debuting in April with an album. On April 21, she released the single \"Week\" which would eventually be included in the album along with its music video but the album itself would not be released until a few months later. The company then revealed on May 16 that the singer will release her debut album in the next month. The 5-track EP was released on June \n\n The album's lead single, \"Suu Whoop\", was released for streaming and digital download on February 16, 2018. Its music video was released on March 13, 2018. The album's second single, \"Big Bank\" featuring 2 Chainz, Big Sean and Nicki Minaj, was released on May 25, 2018. Its music video was released a month later. It peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n Following the success of Minaj's debut album, Pink Friday, Cash Money co-CEO, Brian \"Birdman\" Williams announced to Billboard that Minaj was aiming to release her second album within the first quarter of 2012. In November 2011, Minaj announced on Twitter that the album would be released on February 14, 2012, though it was later delayed to April 3, 2012. The album focuses on Roman Zolanski, one of Minaj's alter egos that was first featured on Pink Friday. On May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking fans to choose the next single(s). The poll was divided into three categories: The second category asked fans to choose between \"Champion\", \"HOV Lane\", and \"I Am Your Leader\". \"Champion\" had the most votes and won the poll; \"HOV Lane\" came in second, and \"I Am Your Leader\" came in third.

It was released on March 30, 2018 via Kemosabe and RCA Records. The album's deluxe version was released on March 1, 2019 and featured her breakthrough singles \"Juicy\", \"Tia Tamera\", and \"Mooo!\". Her first commercial release in four years, Doja Cat has expressed strong disdain toward the record for a number of reasons. Upon its release, Amala was initially a commercial failure and was largely ignored by critics. Only later in August 2018 would the album and Doja Cat as a whole gain attention as her novelty song \"Mooo!\" became an internet meme. As a result, \"Candy\" and \"Juicy\" became sleeper hits, and the album finally debuted on the Billboard 200 chart in August 2019. Amala would eventually peak at number 138 on the chart in November 2019, coinciding with the release of her second studio album, Hot Pink.\n\n\"Taba Taba\" (September 2016) ; \"Rolex\" (February 2017) ; \"Hasni\" (August 2017) ; \"Bavra\" (January 2018) ; \"Caviar\" (September 2018) ; The “Caviar” video was originally planned to be partially shot in Paris, but Issam's visa application was denied by the French government.

Ramiro's first wife was Inés (Agnès), perhaps a member of the French royal house or the family of the Counts of Armagnac. She was buried in the church of San Isidoro de León, where her epitaph names her husband and describes her as \"descended from the kings of France\". She was the mother of his eldest two sons, Alfonso and Fruela. On 22 September 1150 Ramiro gave these two the bridewealth (arras) which he had neglected to give their mother before her death. In the same charter, he gave them the lands he had confiscated from his niece, Estefanía Díaz, \n\n García Ramírez (died 17 July 1086) was an Aragonese prelate and infante. He served as the bishop of Jaca, then the only diocese in Aragon, from 1076 until his death. He temporarily served as the bishop of Pamplona, the principal diocese of neighbouring Navarre, from 1078 until 1082. He was a younger son of King Ramiro I of Aragon and Queen Ermesinda and thus a brother of King Sancho Ramírez. He had good relations with King Alfonso VI of León and Pope Gregory VII, both of whom took his side when he was involved in a dispute with his brother.\n\n Galindo Aznárez and an unknown woman had a son, Aznar Galíndez II, his successor. He appears to have had at least one additional child: an 867 charter mentions a son-in-law, \"king Sancho\", whom several scholars have identified with the younger son of García Íñiguez of Pamplona, Sancho Garcés, father of Aznar Sánchez of Larraun and grandfather of queen Toda of Pamplona. Count Galindo donated money to the Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa.\n\n duke of Gascony, Sancho VI, at the court of Pamplona. Sancho was raised in the monastery of Leyre. His father last appears in 1000, while Sancho is first found as king in 1004, inheriting the kingdom of Pamplona (later known as Navarre). This gap has led to speculation as to whether there was an interregnum, while one document shows Sancho Ramírez of Viguera reigning in Pamplona in 1002, perhaps ruling as had Jimeno Garcés during the youth of García Sánchez I three generations earlier. On his succession, Sancho initially ruled under a council of regency led by the bishops, his mother Jimena, and grandmother Urraca Fernández.\n\n Ordoño Ramírez, called \"the Blind\" (c. undefined 981–before 1024) was the son of King Ramiro III of León and Sancha Gómez, grandson of Sancho I of León and Queen Teresa Ansúrez and, on the maternal side, of Gómez Díaz, Count of Saldaña and Countess Muniadona Fernández.\n\nQuestion: Who is Sancho Ramírez's maternal grandfather?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After being evaluated extensively by many doctors, she was diagnosed to be psychotic.

Susannah becomes suddenly ill, initially showing symptoms of a common flu like a cough and fatigue, but later begins presenting strange behaviour while in a trance state, such as hearing people say things they have not said and hypersensitivity to loud noises.\n\nOver time, her behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Finally, Susannah suffers a seizure and seeks medical treatment. The doctor consulted is adamant it is down to Susannah partying too much, working too hard and not getting enough sleep. She moves in with her mother Rhona (Carrie-Anne Moss) and, after an emotional outburst, suffers another seizure, and is taken to a clinic where she undergoes an MRI. Susannah also believes she may have bipolar disorder due to her severe mood changes.\n\nRhona struggles to care for Susannah, and she later moves in with her father Tom (Richard Armitage) and fiancé. During dinner one night, she becomes violent towards them while suffering another outburst, and her parents demand she is hospitalized despite the MRI, EEG, all other tests showing normal results. There, one of the doctors informs Susannah's parents she could have schizophrenia, and says that if her behavior does not improve, she will be transferred to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nSusannah gradually becomes catatonic, and Dr. Souhel Najjar (Navid Negahban) is asked to help in investigating her case. He has Susannah draw a clock; she draws it with all of the numbers (1–12) on the right side of the face, leading him to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed. Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy for testing. Following the biopsy, it is found that Susannah has a rare disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a brain inflammation, which Najjar describes as \"a brain on fire\". Najjar begins treatment, which leads to a slow but full recovery of her cognitive abilities.\n\nSeven months later, Susannah is back at work. She presents her first written piece since her recovery to her boss Richard (Tyler Perry). It is well received, and he asks her to start writing a book about her experience, which she later titles Brain on Fire.

She opened for Jesse McCartney during his United States tour in 2009. The songs, \"Rain\", \"Crazy That Way\", and \"The Heat\" were featured on the MTV television series The Hills and \"Addicted2Me\" on The City. The single \"Boom\" has been featured on programs such as ABC's Eastwick, The CW's Melrose Place, and The Vampire Diaries. Anjulie has toured with Shwayze and B.o.B., toured Fall/Winter (2009–2010) with Raphael Saadiq, and opened for Hedley on their tour in support of Storms.

The singer traveled to New Orleans to record her new album, with David Rubinson, producer of Labelle's final album prior to their initial breakup, Chameleon, and also famed for his work with The Pointer Sisters. Signing a solo contract with Epic Records, Labelle's former label, the singer released her debut album in October 1977. While the debuting single, \"Joy to Have Your Love\", became a minor R&B hit, and the dance number, \"Dan Swit Me\", was popular on the dance club circuit, the album's most notable song was a ballad co-composed by LaBelle, Edwards and LaBelle's musical \n\n James \"Budd\" Ellison, initially dedicated to LaBelle's and Edwards' only biological son, Zuri (who is now LaBelle's manager), titled \"You Are My Friend\". While the song only scaled the high sixties on the US Billboard R&B chart, it soon became one of her famous show-stoppers while performing the song. LaBelle performed the song at her first solo concert in London, getting a standing ovation, which helped to give LaBelle motivation to continue her career. The album, when released, performed successfully, reaching number 62 on the US Billboard 200 and number 31 on the R&B albums chart, while critics hailed the album.\n\n Patti LaBelle ended an eighteen-year association with Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash as their group Labelle had decided to break up. LaBelle reluctantly carried on with a solo career with the support of then-husband Armstead Edwards, who signed on as her personal manager. In the middle of recording her debut album in New Orleans with Chameleon producer David Rubinson, Labelle and Edwards wrote lyrics to a James \"Budd\" Ellison composition they called \"You Are My Friend\". The song was a tribute to the couple's only child, Zuri Edwards. The song was one of the last to be recorded for LaBelle's debut self-titled solo album.\n\n Prior to recording the album, LaBelle initially thought of retiring from the music industry after nearly twenty years as the lead singer of the hugely successful girl group Labelle. Following the group's March 1977 split, brought on by months of growing tension, LaBelle and her husband of then eight years, Armstead Edwards, went to see a shrink over emotional distress in their marriage, which was partially due to the singer's fright over continuing a career without her group members. After further evaluation, LaBelle and her husband sorted out their differences.

His parents were Stu and Helen Hart. Smith was the first of their twelve children, being one of their eight sons, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Bret, Ross and Owen followed him. Hart is also the father of two professional wrestlers, Mike and Matt Hart. Hart wrestled for the majority of his career in Canada but also worked briefly in other countries and is best known for his time in Stampede Wrestling and for his appearances for WWE. He died in 2017 due to prostate cancer.\n\n Around 1981 Bassarab was encouraged by his future brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith to pursue pro wrestling. Bassarab was trained by Stu Hart and debuted in Hart's Calgary, Alberta based Stampede Wrestling promotion under his own name in 1983. Bassarab formed a tag team with Phil Lafleur. They faced Danny Davis and Hubert Gallant for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in early 1984, but the match was ruled a no-contest and the title was vacated. The acquisition of Stampede by Vince McMahon (owner of the World Wrestling Federation, WWF) in 1985 led to many Stampede wrestlers being signed by the WWF. The British Bulldogs, Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart, and Bret Hart were all hired, but Bassarab was not. \n\n Gregory Smith was born in 1986 in Cleveland, Ohio. Born one month prematurely and weighing one pound at birth, Smith was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which has left his right arm withered and with extremely limited range of motion. As a child he was subject to bullying, which Smith today attributes to other children not being able to understand his condition. He developed his own unique set of coping skills for dealing with bullying, centered on his being willing and able to tell his own story, and to do it in a self-effacing and sometimes humorous manner. At the same time, his family life left him with little support. While his father, Dwane, worked to support the family, Dwane's wife Gloria became addicted to drugs and would sell off family possessions, and use rent money, to purchase drugs. The couple separated, and Greg, in Gloria's custody, was left to raise his two younger brothers, until Gloria went to jail and Dwane won custody of the boys. Smith's grandmother, a fan of Hulk Hogan, introduced him to professional wrestling. \"She meant a lot to me, and everything I do in wrestling is in her honor.\"\n\n Smith was born on September 2, 1977. He was a former high school wrestler and teacher. He attended UCLA in college but at that time, they did not have a wrestling team so some students who wrestled in high school would meet at the Wooden Center to wrestle. He was introduced to Brazilian jiu-jitsu when during one of their wrestling sessions a BJJ instructor invited him to attend a class that night at the same room. After graduating Smith trained at Team Punishment.\n\n Harry Francis Smith (born 2 August 1985), better known by the ring names Davey Boy Smith Jr and David Hart Smith, is a British Canadian pro wrestler.

On 6 March 1731 he married Mary Oliphant, daughter of Charles Oliphant (brother of William Oliphant, 11th Lord Oliphant). He died without issue on 4 January 1735 at Edinburgh, Scotland. He was succeeded as earl by his younger brother, Thomas Lyon, 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.\n\n Anne Bowes-Lyon was born in Washington, D.C., in 1917. Her father was the Hon. John Herbert Bowes-Lyon and her mother was the Hon. Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, daughter of Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton. Anne had three younger sisters, two of whom were Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon, who were institutionalized from 1941 for severe intellectual disability. Anne's paternal grandfather was Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, father of her aunt Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who was born Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.\n\n On 12 May 1646, 17 days before his third birthday, Patrick inherited the titles of third Earl of Kinghorne and eleventh Lord Glamis from his father, as well as Glamis Castle and Castle Lyon (now Castle Huntly), which had been purchased by 1st Earl of Kinghorne in 1614. On 30 May 1672 he obtained a new charter, ratified in Parliament on 1 July 1677, giving an addition to his title, which was in future to be Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon, Lord Glammis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw, and Stradichtie, with the precedence of the former honour of Earl of Kinghorne.\n\nHon.

The couple had four children: \n\n Lyon was the younger son of John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis, by his wife Janet Keith, daughter of Robert, Lord Keith, and sister of the fourth Marischal. He was one of the youths who attended King James in Stirling during his minority. His original style was Sir Thomas of Auldbar and Balduckie. On the death of his elder brother, John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis, in 1578, he became tutor to his nephew, Patrick, ninth lord, and, being after Patrick the nearest presumptive heir to the title, was known as Master of Glamis. He married Agnes Gray, widow of Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home, who died in 1575; and his right to the keeping of Hume Castle in opposition to Andrew Kerr, commendator of Jedburgh, was confirmed by the privy council on 8 November 1578.

Directed by Maurice Gleize, the screenplay was written by Charles Spaak, based on a novel by Jean Martet. The film stars Jean Gabin, Michèle Morgan, and Pierre Renoir. It tells the story of a wanderer in Australia who kills a man in a fight and goes on the run. He meets a girl who is hiding in the wilds and the two fall in love, but they are pursued by a determined police detective.\n\n Initially working for the American company Paramount, they formed the company Paris-Film Production in 1934. They financed Julien Duvivier's Pépé le Moko (1937), Jean Renoir's La Bête Humaine (1938) and Marcel Carné's Le Jour se lève (Daybreak 1939), all starring Jean Gabin. The brothers lived to the United States during World War II. After the war they worked on several American films, including Renoir's The Southerner (1945) and The Long Night (1947), a remake of Le Jour se lève with Henry Fonda. In 1950, they returned to France and embarked on producing films aimed at an international audience. Casque d'or (1953) effectively launched the career of Simone Signoret and Plein Soleil (1960) did the same for Alain Delon. Notre Dame de Paris (1956) with Anthony Quinn as Quasimodo and Gina Lollobrigida as Esmeralda was internationally successful, but not critically well received. In the \n\n Maria Chapdelaine, a 1934 production directed by Julien Duvivier. He was then cast as a romantic hero in the 1936 war drama La Bandera; this second Duvivier-directed film established him as a major star. The next year he teamed up with Duvivier again in the highly successful Pépé le Moko. Its popularity brought Gabin international recognition. That same year he starred in Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion, an antiwar film that ran at a New York City theatre for an unprecedented six months. This was followed by another of Renoir's major works, La Bête Humaine (The Human Beast), a film noir tragedy based on the novel by Émile Zola and starring Gabin and Simone Simon, as well as Le Quai Des Brumes (Port of Shadows), one of director Marcel Carné's classics of poetic realism. He divorced his second wife in 1939.\n\n Shot in Lyon in the spring of 1895, the film portrays a simple practical joke in which a gardener is tormented by a boy who steps on the hose that the gardener is using to water his plants, cutting off the water flow. When the gardener tilts the nozzle up to inspect it, the boy releases the hose, causing the water to spray him. The gardener is stunned and his hat is knocked off, but he soon catches on. A chase ensues, both on and off-screen (the camera never moves from its original position) until the gardener catches the boy and administers a spanking. The entire film lasts only 45 seconds, but this simple bit of slapstick may be the forerunner of all subsequent film comedy. The 1896 film version replaces the boy with a teenager and the spanking action is substituted with a kick in the rump.\n\n  In 1945, thanks to his contact with Daniel Gélin, de Funès made his film debut at the age of 31 with a bit part in Jean Stelli's La Tentation de Barbizon. He appears on screen for less than 40 seconds in the role of the porter of the cabaret Le Paradis, welcoming the character played by Jérôme Chambon in the entrance hall and pointing him to the double doors leading to the main room, saying: \"C'est par ici, Monsieur\" (\"It's this way, Sir\"). Chambon declines the invitation, pushing the door himself instead of pulling it open. De Funès then says: \"Bien, il a son compte celui-là, aujourd'hui!\" (\"Well, he had enough, today!\").

It won the National Book Awards \"Autobiography of the Year\" in 2012. Clare Balding has close family links to horse racing: her father, Ian Balding, trained Mill Reef, 1971 winner of The Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes; and her younger brother, Andrew Balding, trained Casual Look, the winner of the 2003 Epsom Oaks. The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Her uncle Toby Balding trained winners in the Grand National, Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle. Furthermore, \n\n Balding was privately educated at the independent, Downe House school in Berkshire, where she was Head Girl and a contemporary of comedian Miranda Hart. Hart and Balding are in fact tenth-cousins, sharing a nine-times-great-grandfather in Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet. Clare Balding applied to read law at Christ's College, Cambridge, but failed her interview and realised that law was not what she most wanted to do. She later successfully applied to Newnham College, Cambridge, and read English. While at university she was President of the Cambridge Union Society in Easter 1992 and graduated in 1993 with a 2:1 honours degree.

His father was David Fanning, and he grew up in Johnston County, North Carolina. He developed a childhood scalp condition which, according to oral traditions collected by early North Carolina historian Eli Caruthers, resulted in long-term baldness. Fanning and his sister were orphaned in 1764 by the death of their father, and in 1773, David settled on a tributary of the Reedy River in South Carolina. At the onset of the American Revolutionary War, Fanning was also an officer in a local militia unit in the South Carolina upcountry. In 1775, that region leaned in favor of the Loyalists, and Fanning lent himself to that cause.\n\n Andrew Matthews Balding (born 29 December 1972) is a British racehorse trainer based at Park House Stables, Kingsclere, near Newbury, Berkshire. Balding attended Caldicott School, a boys' preparatory school, and Radley College, a public school. He became a licensed trainer in January 2003, when he succeeded his father Ian Balding.

The producer then sent it to 808Melo. The original melody of the song, created by Hackney, is called \"Wild West\" and had a Western concert flute over it. 808Melo played the song's beat for Pop Smoke when they were recording in the Bahamas; the track had 808Melo's signature sounds on it. Pop Smoke found it challenging to record the song because of the melody and when 808Melo played the song, Pop Smoke said: \"Um, I like it, but I don't know.\" 808Melo was going to scrap the beat, until Pop Smoke wanted to record the song. Nagra called Hackney and explained he had heard a snippet of the song and immediately knew that it started with his original melody. At the end of the phone call, he told Hackey that the song was going to end up on the album. The song was written by Pop Smoke, known as Bashar Jackson, alongside 808Melo, who has the real name of Andre Loblack, Jugraj Nagra, and Carson Hackney. It was produced by the latter three.\n\n Desire is the second solo album from hip hop artist Pharoahe Monch, released on June 26, 2007.

Their engagement was announced on 10 March 1965, and they were married on 10 January 1967 in The Hague, in the St. James Church. It was decreed that any children from the marriage would be titled Prince/Princess of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, with the style of Highness, titles that would not be held by their descendants. Together, they had four children: Princes Maurits (born 17 April 1968), Bernhard (born 25 December 1969), Pieter-Christiaan (born 22 March 1972), and Floris (born 10 April 1975).

Van Vollenhoven married Princess Margriet of the Netherlands at The Hague on January 10, 1967, in the St. James Church.

Parents: Consorts and Issue:\n\n In the coup attempt, Chen Shubao suffered serious injuries, and Consort Zhang attended to him in the illness, as he did not favor Empress Shen and did not allow Empress Shen to attend to him. She became even more favored than before, and she effectively became the ruler of his palace notwithstanding that Empress Shen was empress. Chen Shubao had a large number of concubines—10 of whom were said to be favored—but Consort Zhang continued to be his favorite. He constructed three particularly luxurious pavilions within his palace—Linchun Pavilion (臨春閣), Jieqi Pavilion (結綺閣), and Wangxian Pavilion (望仙閣), residing himself \n\n was infatuated with her and took her as a concubine.

According to tribal custom Willie can then claim Lola as his wife. According to the law, Deputy Sheriff Cooper (Robert Redford) is required to charge him with murder. Willie Boy and Lola are hunted for several days by a posse led by Cooper. Willie manages to repel the posse's advance when he ambushes them from the top of Ruby Mountain. He only tries to shoot their horses, but ends up accidentally killing a bounty hunter, resulting in another murder charge.

However that movie encountered censorship problems and A Co-respondent's Course, although shot later, was selected to support Diggers instead. It encountered trouble from the Victorian censor. Peter Fitzpatrick, biographer of F.W. Thring, later wrote that the film was \"heavy-going\": \"The lack of action in many of its dialogue scenes is exacerbated by the static single-take camera work, and by an excessive concern with circumstantial realism that produces 'book-ends' of extended hellos and goodbyes in many scenes, and excruciatingly prolonged telephone calls in which phone numbers are always carefully enunciated and there are long pauses while the caller listens patiently to someone whom we cannot see or hear. And a lot of the conversation is stagey and stilted. Still... the film... [has] at least a period charm.\" Fitzpatrick though the movie was partly redeemed by making fun of the absurdity of its male characters and use of external locations.\n\n Reviews for the series were positive. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rated it 100% \"fresh\" based on 10 reviews. The Guardian praised the series and called it \"a gloriously dark sitcom about depression and rage\". The New York Times also reviewed it positively saying, \"Flowers isn't really about any particular story. It's a portrait – a weird, Edward Gorey-like portrait of a family with loves, suspicions and insecurities, perhaps not all that different from yours, after all.\" Reception of the second series was similarly positive, once again garnering a 100% \"fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews. Writing for The Guardian, Sam Wollaston awarded four stars out of five, stating: \"The second series of Will Sharpe’s deeply imaginative comedy-drama has been serious and sensitive in its handling of difficult issues, and hilarious to boot.\"\n\n The film was shot in late 1957, and gave an early lead role to Charles Bronson. The film was the first in a series that Gene Fowler Jr. made for Robert L. Lippert. Fowler said \"that Lippert experience was wonderful in a way because we had the run of the Fox lot; whatever sets happened to be still standing, we'd use those sets. My partner, Lou Vittes and I, would walk through those sets that had already been used for more expensive pictures than we could make and we would pretty much write the script around those sets.\" Parts of the theme song sound similar to the theme from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, directed by John Ford four years later and starring John Wayne, James Stewart and Lee Marvin.\n\n Showdown at Boot Hill is a 1958 American Western film directed by Gene Fowler Jr., written by Louis Vittes, and starring Charles Bronson, Robert Hutton, John Carradine, Carole Mathews, Fintan Meyler and Paul Maxey.

She has about 10 episodes of diarrhea daily. She has had three similar episodes in the past 7 years. She denies any recent travel or sick contacts, rush, cough or other symptoms of infection. She has no known allergies and does not take any medications currently. She has been taking 5-ASA, but stopped 6 months ago as she had been asymptomatic for 10 months before that. On presentation, the patient is afebrile with a body temperature of 101.0 F and appears ill. Her blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg and heart rate of 90 beats/minute. Abdominal examination is remarkable for abdominal tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no rebound or guarding. A subsequent CT scan shows dilatation of the left colonic lumen, as well as a thickened colon wall with pericolic fat stranding, particularly in the left colon. The admitting team determines the patient’s presentation is due to exacerbation of her disease. The patient is started on 5-ASA, metronidazole and prednisone and her condition improves within 10 days when she is symptom-free. What is the most appropriate plan after her symptoms have resolved?\n468) An 18-month-old girl is brought to the hospital by her parents because of a high fever and generalized “body shaking” 2 hours ago. The parents say that she was “pretty fussy” all day and her temperature at that time was 37.3 °C (99.2 °F). Over the past few hours, she began to “burn up,” with her temperature spiking to 39.7 °C (103.4 °F). They put her into her crib to go to sleep, and they heard “banging” coming from the baby monitor in their bedroom. When they arrived in her room 10 seconds later, her entire body was “shaking”.

Jennings formed the band in 1961, consisting of Jerry Gropp on the guitar and Richie Albright on the drums after moving to Phoenix, Arizona. The band earned a local fan base during its appearances on the night club JD's. In 1965 RCA Records signed Jennings to a contract. The conservative restrictions of the producers of the label did not allow him to record with the Waylors, due to the Nashville custom of the time using session musicians instead of a performer's backup band. In 1972 he renegotiated his contract, and he included the Waylors for the first time on a RCA album in Honky Tonk Heroes. The lineup was expanded during the next decade, they backed Jennings until his death in 2002.

After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a plane for himself, Allsup and Jennings to avoid a long bus trip to Fargo, North Dakota. This is because the tour organizers provided very inadequate transportation & the buses broke down in freezing weather. Jennings gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, who was suffering from a cold and complaining about how uncomfortable a long bus trip was for a man of his size.

The young couple occupied a suite of apartments at Versailles which had previously been occupied by their joint ancestor Madame de Montespan. These apartments were used by the duke and his family until the reign of Louis XVI of France when the space was given to Mesdames, the new king's spinster aunts, Louis XV's unmarried daughters.

In 1381 Richard II of England despatched a powerful force to Lisbon, and betrothed his cousin Prince Edward to Beatrice, only child of Ferdinand, who had been recognized as heiress to the throne by the Cortes of Leiria (1376). In 1383, Ferdinand made peace with John I of Castile at Salvaterra, deserting his English allies, who retaliated by ravaging part of his territory.

As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. When the cortes met in late 1438, a law was passed requiring a joint regency consisting of Leonor and Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, the younger brother of the late king. The dual regency was a failure and in 1439, the cortes named Pedro \"protector and guardian\" of the king and \"ruler and defender\" of the kingdom.

In May 1275 the Marinids from Morocco landed in Spain upon call from Muhammad II of Granada and attacked Castile. Ferdinand raised troops and moved south from Burgos to defend the kingdom but died unexpectedly in Villa Real on 25 June 1275 leaving Castile open to invasion. His sons did not inherit the throne of their grandfather, since their uncle Sancho, who had repulsed the Moorish invasion, usurped the throne.\n\n Ferdinand I, claimed the thrones of León and Castile, left vacant by the death of King Peter of Castile (1369); he based his claim on the fact that his grandmother Beatrice (1367–1385) belonged to the legitimate line of Castile.

Ferdinand, however, preferred his Portuguese mistress, Leonor Telles de Menezes, whom he eventually married. To avenge this slight, Henry of Castile invaded Portugal and besieged Lisbon.

Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly referred to as the \"Dauphin\", was restyled the Prince Royal. Louis-Charles held that title until the fall of the monarchy on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in Hamm, in today's North Rhine-Westphalia, his uncle, the Count of Provence and future Louis XVIII, who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself Regent for the young imprisoned king.\n\n After Henry II and Catherine de' Medici were married, several years passed without the birth of any children. Though various remedies were tried, none proved to be effective. According to court sources, the royal couple then turned to the court physician Fernel for help in conceiving. Louis was born on 3 February 1549 at the Palace of Fontainebleau, the couple's second son and fourth child. From birth he was second in line to the throne and endowed with the duchy of Orléans. He was raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d'Humières and Françoise d'Humières, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers, and reportedly shared the same nursery with his brother and sister Francis and Elisabeth, and later with his brother Charles. Louis was present when five-year-old Mary, Queen of Scots arrived at Henry II's court to be raised as the intended bride and queen of Francis, the future king of France and king consort of Scots. There are reports that Henry II and Catherine planned for Louis to one day become the Duke of Urbino, a title which belonged exclusively to the Medici family.\n\n Charles Philippe of France was born in 1757, the youngest son of the Dauphin Louis and his wife, the Dauphine Marie Josèphe, at the Palace of Versailles. Charles was created Count of Artois at birth by his grandfather, the reigning King Louis XV. As the youngest male in the family, Charles seemed unlikely ever to become king. His eldest brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, died unexpectedly in 1761, which moved Charles up one place in the line of succession. He was raised in early childhood by Madame de Marsan, the Governess of the Children of France. At the death of his father in 1765, Charles's oldest surviving brother, Louis Auguste, became the new Dauphin (the heir apparent to the French throne). Their mother Marie Josèphe, who never recovered from the loss of her husband, died in March 1767 from tuberculosis. This left Charles an orphan at the age of nine, along with his siblings Louis Auguste, Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence, Clotilde (\"Madame Clotilde\"), and Élisabeth (\"Madame Élisabeth\"). Louis XV fell ill on 27 April 1774 and died on 10 May of smallpox at the age of 64. His grandson Louis-Auguste succeeded him as King Louis XVI of France.\n\n Louis XVII (born Louis Charles, Duke of Normandy; 27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795) was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the new Dauphin (heir apparent to the throne), a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the title of Prince Royal. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as the king of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic and since Louis-Charles died in June 1795, he never actually ruled. Nevertheless, in 1814 after the Bourbon Restoration, his uncle acceded to the throne and was proclaimed Louis XVIII.\n\n Louis-Charles d'Albert was born 25 December 1620 in the Louvre. He was a son of Charles d'Albert, 1st Duke of Luynes, a favorite of Louis XIII, and Princess Marie Aimée de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Montbazon (1600–1679). After his father's death, his mother remarried to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse (a son of Henry I, Duke of Guise), with whom she had three daughters. Upon Claude's death in 1655, the Chevreuse peerage became extinct and his mother bought the duchy. After her death in August 1679, Louis-Charles inherited the duchy of Chevreuse, and his descendants have held it since. His maternal grandparents were Hercules de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon and, his first wife, Marie de Bretagne d'Avaugour. His paternal grandparents were Anne de Rodulf and Honoré d'Albert (1540–1592), seigneur de Luynes (in today's département Bouches-du-Rhône in Provence), who was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV of France. His paternal uncle was Honoré d'Albert, Duke of Chaulnes.\n\nQuestion: Where was the father of Prince Charles Louis, Duke Of Chartres born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The vital clue comes from a charter of King Edgar, in which he confirmed the grant of an estate at Uppidelen (Piddletrenthide, Dorset) made by his grandmother (ava) Wynflæd to Shaftesbury. She may well be the nun or vowess (religiosa femina) of this name in a charter dated 942 and preserved in the abbey's chartulary. It records that she received and retrieved from King Edmund a handful of estates in Dorset, namely Cheselbourne and Winterbourne Tomson, which somehow ended up in the possession of the community. Since no father or siblings are known, further speculation on \n\n first abbess, King Alfred's daughter Æthelgifu, so much so perhaps that William of Malmesbury wrote contradictory reports on the abbey's early history. In the Gesta regum, he correctly identifies the first abbess as Alfred's daughter, following Asser, although he gives her the name of Ælfgifu (Elfgiva), while in his Gesta pontificum, he credits Edmund's wife Ælfgifu with the foundation. Either William encountered conflicting information, or he meant to say that Ælfgifu refounded the nunnery. In any event, William would have had access to local traditions at Shaftesbury, since he probably wrote a now lost metrical Life for the community, a fragment of which he included in his Gesta pontificum:   \n\n Ælfflæd or Æthelflæd (fl. 840) is not recorded before the twelfth century. William of Malmesbury describes Æthelflæd as the daughter of King Ceolwulf I of Mercia, wife of King Wiglaf's son Wigmund, and mother of Wigstan. According to Thomas of Marlborough's hagiographical life of Wigstan, when his father King Wigmund died in 840, Wigstan refused to become king, preferring a life of religion. His relative Beorhtwulf then asked for permission to marry the widowed queen, Æfflæd, and when Wigstan refused, he had him murdered. John of Worcester has a different version of Wigstan's parentage and death, which he dates to 849. Wigstan was regarded as a saint, like many other Anglo-Saxon royals murdered for political reasons. She was the heir of her father and his brother Coenwulf, and, by the middle of the century, she was probably abbess of Winchcombe, as she was disposing of its property. She died after 850, and may have been the mother of King Ceolwulf II and Eadburh, wife of Æthelred Mucel.\n\n according to which the abbey exchanged with King Edmund the large estate at Tisbury (Wiltshire) for Butticanlea (unidentified). Ælfgifu received it from her husband and intended to bequeath it back to the nunnery, but such had not yet come to pass (her son Eadwig demanded that Butticanlea was returned to the royal family first). Ælfgifu predeceased her husband, probably in 944, and may have died in childbirth of Edgar. In the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that she suffered from an illness during the last few years of her life, but there may have been some confusion with details of Æthelgifu's life as recorded in a forged foundation charter of the late 11th or 12th century (see below). Her body was buried and enshrined at the nunnery.\n\n by the king, Edward the Confessor, himself. They stayed at the great cathedral city and monastic centre of Reims, named after St Remigius, apostle of the Franks, who is buried there in a large Romanesque Basilica. Burchard fell mortally ill and requested burial in the Benedictine Abbey, in return for a donation of land on his behalf. To fulfil his son's desire, and to benefit his soul, Ælfgar gave to St. Rémy five pieces of land: at Lapley, Hamstall Ridware, Meaford, and Marston in Church Eaton, all in Staffordshire, and at Silvington in Shropshire.

He is the youngest son of Brenda Rose after Dwayne, Reggie, and Allan. All three were talented basketball players who taught Rose the ins and outs of basketball on nearby courts. As his talent for the sport grew, Rose began to attract much more outside attention in Chicago's basketball circles, leading his mother and brothers to restrict outside contact to him. She feared he would be exploited and his path to the NBA diverted by outside parties like street agents, similar to what happened to former Chicago prospect Ronnie Fields.\n\n Williams grew up in Hyde Park, Chicago and learned how to play basketball from his father, Theodore, who took him to pick-up games at the city parks. When his parents separated during his childhood, he began living with his mother, Shawndra Lewis. As a freshman, Williams played basketball for Mount Carmel High School in Chicago and led the freshman team to a 26–0 record. When he was 15 years old and a sophomore, his uncle, Tyjuan Lewis, was shot and killed. Williams' trauma from the death prompted him to leave Chicago and transfer to the Henry Ford Academy School for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan, where his uncle and Lewis' brother was the principal.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan.

Abrams.

The film received mixed reviews with praise for the cast and Ford's performance but criticized for its sentimentality and manipulativeness. The film grossed $88 million at the box office on a production budget of $25 million.\n\nPlot\n\nAmbitious, callous, narcissistic, and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a wealthy successful Manhattan lawyer whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his socialite wife, Sarah, and troubled preteen daughter, Rachel. He has just won a malpractice suit, defending a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned doctors about a pre-existing condition.\n\nRunning out to a convenience store to buy cigarettes one night, Henry is shot when he interrupts a robbery. One bullet hits his right frontal lobe, while the other hits his left subclavian artery, causing excessive internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. He experiences anoxia, resulting in brain damage.\n\nHenry survives but can neither move nor talk and he suffers retrograde amnesia. While in a nursing facility, he slowly regains movement and speech with the help of a physical therapist named Bradley. Henry's recovery creates a financial burden for the family. Upon returning home, Henry is almost childlike. As he forges new relationships with his family, he realizes he does not like who he once was.\n\nSarah enrolls Rachel into an out-of-town elite school, though she is now reluctant to go. At orientation, Henry tells Rachel a lie to help her adjust to the new school. He and Sarah grow closer, as they were when they first met. Henry also misses Rachel.\n\nHenry's firm allows him to return out of deference to his previous contributions. Sarah suggests they relocate to a smaller, less expensive residence. As his firm essentially assigns him only low-level work, he realizes he no longer wants to be a lawyer. While at a dinner party, they overhear several \"friends\" making derogatory comments about him.\n\nHenry, finding a former colleague's letters to Sarah disclosing they had an affair, becomes angry and leaves home. He is confronted by Linda, a fellow attorney, who reveals they were having an affair and that he was going to leave Sarah. Henry has second thoughts about himself and his relationships.\n\nHenry gives the hospital documents that his firm had suppressed to the plaintiff that proves his case, and he apologizes. He then resigns from the firm. He realizes that (as Sarah had said) everything had been wrong before but it is now so much better. They reconcile, then go to Rachel's school and withdraw her. She is overjoyed to be with her parents. As they leave the building, she tosses her school-uniform hat away.\n\nCast\n\n Harrison Ford as Henry Turner\n Annette Bening as Sarah Turner\n Mikki Allen as Rachel Turner\n Bill Nunn as Bradley\n Rebecca Miller as Linda\n Bruce Altman as Bruce\n Elizabeth Wilson as Jessica\n Donald Moffat as Charlie Cameron\n John Leguizamo as Convenience Store Robber\n Robin Bartlett as Phyllis\n James Rebhorn as Dr. Sultan\n J.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \"a sentimental urban fairy tale\" that \"succeeds neither as an all-out inspirational drama nor as a send-up of American manners.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \"There is possibly a good movie to be found somewhere within this story, but Mike Nichols has not found it in Regarding Henry. This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.\" Ebert also described the way it makes a connection between Ritz Crackers and the Ritz-Carlton hotel (which reveals that Henry's affair had in fact been deeply embedded in his apparently lost memories) as \"especially annoying\", apparently regarding it as comic.\n\nRita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" However, he praised Ford's performance.\n\nVariety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\"\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a \"Rotten\" 43% rating based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties.\n \nSlate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. In particular, he cites a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMore recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE. For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity. These CTE symptoms include cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems.\n\nAfter comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue.

Landesman stated the changes were made \"to portray the characters and story as accurately as possible to reduce the chance that the league could attack the filmmakers for taking too much creative license\".\n\nSee also\n League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\n Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis\n Concussions in American football\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n2015 films\n2015 biographical drama films\n2010s sports drama films\n2015 thriller drama films\nAfrican-American biographical dramas\nAmerican films\nAmerican biographical drama films\nAmerican sports drama films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nEnglish-language films\nBiographical films about sportspeople\nDrama films based on actual events\nFilms about diseases\nFilms about suicide\nFilms based on newspaper and magazine articles\nFilms set in 2002\nFilms set in 2005\nFilms set in California\nFilms set in New York City\nFilms set in Pittsburgh\nFilms set in Washington, D.C.\nFilms shot in Pennsylvania\nFilms shot in Pittsburgh\nFilms with screenplays by Peter Landesman\nSports films based on actual events\nVillage Roadshow Pictures films\nColumbia Pictures films\nFilms scored by James Newton Howard\nFilms directed by Peter Landesman\nCultural depictions of players of American football\nCultural depictions of American men\n2015 drama films\n\nConcussion is a 2015 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the exposé \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published in 2009 by GQ magazine. Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL.

She returns, accompanied by her son Colin, daughter-in-law Pamela, and daughter Jane.

The family is joined by Jacob Friedland, an art dealer who has for many years handled Sorodin's pictures and looked after his financial affairs. They eject Clinton.

The Elector was the son of Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of James VI and I and first cousin and heir presumptive to Queen Anne of Great Britain. However, Sophia died before Anne at age 83 in June 1714, which elevated the Elector to heir-presumptive; Queen Anne died on 1 August the same year, and Sophia's son became King George I. This made Frederick's father \n\n Frederick was the eldest son of Duke Magnus II of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Wolfenbüttel, and his consort Catherine of Anhalt-Bernburg. A minor upon his father's death in 1373, he was not declared to have reached the age of majority until 1381, while Duke Otto of Brunswick-Göttingen acted as his guardian. Like his father, he was thrust into the Lüneburg Succession War, which he and his brothers attempted to end in 1373 by a treaty with the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg. According to this treaty, the rule over the Principality of Lüneburg would alternate between the two families. However, the dispute continued; together with his brothers, Frederick eventually won the war by conquering Lüneburg itself in 1388.

Now, however, the family of Tati's illegitimate and estranged eldest child, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, who lives in the north-east of England, are calling for the French director to give her credit as the true inspiration for the film. The script of L'illusionniste, they say, was Tati's response to the shame of having abandoned his first child [Schiel] and it remains the only public recognition of her existence. They accuse Chomet of attempting to airbrush out their painful family legacy again.\" Tati's grandson, Richard Tatischeff Schiel McDonald, wrote a long letter to the film critic Roger Ebert in 2010, openly criticising the production's interpretation of Tati's intent for the script and explaining the family's understanding of its origins with respect to Tati's having abandoned his eldest child.\n\n During the 1980s, concerned that their father's legacy would be permanently lost, Pierre and Sophie Tatischeff tracked the rights to their father's oeuvre to a bank in Switzerland. The bank, unable to trace the owner who had made the deposit, eventually returned the rights to Pierre and Sophie as heirs to their father's estate. In 1995, after a year of meticulous work, Sophie, with the aid of film technician François Ede, was able for the first time to release a colour print of Jour de fête, as Tati had originally intended.

He appeared in the wake of the French New Wave alongside contemporaries like Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style, which drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his French New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by Michel Legrand) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967).\n\n The Mirage (Le Mirage) is a 2015 Canadian comedy-drama film from Quebec. Written by Louis Morissette and directed by Ricardo Trogi, the film marked Trogi's first time directing a screenplay he had not written himself. The film stars Morissette as Patrick Lupien, an owner of a sporting goods store who is becoming dissatisfied with the empty consumerism of his day-to-day life and the loss of emotional and sexual intimacy in his relationship with Isabelle (Julie Perreault). Critics compared the film's themes and plot to both The Decline of the American Empire and American Beauty.

During his administration, he greatly increased the number of priests in the diocese, securing the services of the Augustinians and the Conventual Franciscans. Among the many institutions he founded were an industrial school, St. Agnes's Rural Cemetery, St. Peter's Hospital, and a house for the Little Sisters of the Poor. He convoked the second diocesan synod, and attended the Plenary Councils of Baltimore and the First Vatican Council.

He is one of great credit amongst his countrymen, and upon whom, as touching causes of religion, they wholly depend.'\" After enduring seven years' imprisonment, he escaped to France about 1572. He appears to have returned to Ireland and resumed his episcopal functions in 1575, as in April of that year he had a brief from Rome empowering him to act for the dioceses of Armagh and Dublin, as well as Meath.

It was founded in 2001 by Mitchell Miller and Johnny Rodger. Although its title is Scots (Eng: The Thirst) the magazine is published mostly in Scottish Standard English though features and fiction do regularly appear in languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, Broad Scots and Scottish Gaelic. The Drouth is unusual for a Scottish literary magazine in that it only infrequently publishes poetry, arguing that as poetry covers a good portion of other magazines’ content, its efforts are better focused on other art-forms less well represented in Scotland's 'small mags'. The magazine works on a commissioning basis, and does not encourage unsolicited submissions. It has a particular focus on literature, film and politics but also covers visual art, music, architecture, photography and comix, as well as giving generous space to creative fiction. The magazine sponsors a number of cultural events, mostly in Glasgow. Every issue also features a guest editor (usually someone of distinction in a given field) and guest cover artist.\n\n were run by the magazine, particularly in the early years when it was necessary to encourage submissions.

Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said in his review; \"Though the performers gamely try to make the most of what little they have to work with, the film is murky to look at and unfocused in its storytelling. \"Dead Awake\" is a deadly snore.\" Positive marks came from the NYC Movie Guru, who called the film \"an intriguing blend of mystery, suspense, drama and supernatural thrills that slightly loses steam as its trust in the audience's intelligence wanes.\"\n\n Directed by Andrew Currie. The film takes place after the zombie apocalypse, in a small, safe, idyllic 1950s-style town. In this film zombies are kept as slaves or pets, until something inevitably goes wrong.\n\n The film was originally more of a genre film, but budget constraints meant that director Bing Bailey needed to turn it into a hybrid of mockumentary and genre film. Bailey said that he wanted to \"have his Evil Dead experience\". Pre-production was done over the Internet, as Bailey was living in the United States at the time. Shooting took place in October 2009, May 2010, and May 2011; the additional shoots were due to a revamp of the initial concept that involved abandoned man-on-the-street interviews. Post-production took another 18 months.\n\n The reviews for the film were generally positive. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 72% approval rating with an average rating of 5.7/10 based on 18 reviews. Metacritic rated it 59/100 based on six reviews. Joe Leydon of Variety wrote, \"With nary a trace of snark, satire or self-consciousness, Brit sibling filmmakers Howard J. and Jon Ford breathe some fresh life into zombie-thriller tropes.\" Mark Adams of Screen Daily wrote, \"And while the story offers nothing particularly new to the genre, The Dead is a film made with passion and enthusiasm and is certainly distinctive in tone and backdrop.\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"This low-budget zombie movie rises out of the pack thanks to a smart and ambitious decision to shoot in Burkina Faso.\" \n\n In 2014, Jannat made her acting debut in the film Love Station, where her co-actor was Bappy Chowdhury.

Directed by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, the Chinese-French co-production features a Chinese student who is sent to Inner Mongolia to teach shepherds and instead learns about the wolf population, which is under threat by a government apparatchik. The Beijing Forbidden City Film Corporation initially sought to hire a Chinese director, but filming humans with real wolves was considered too difficult. New Zealand director Peter Jackson was approached, but production did not take place. Annaud, whose 1997 film Seven Years in Tibet is banned in China, had his personal ban lifted and was hired to direct Wolf Totem. The film was produced under China Film Group and French-based Reperage. The French director, who had worked with animals on other films, acquired \n\n 100 Years is an upcoming experimental science fiction film written by John Malkovich and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Advertised in 2015 with the tagline \"The Movie You Will Never See\", it is due to be released on November 18, 2115. The 100-year span matches the time it takes for a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac to be properly aged before its release to consumers. The film stars an international ensemble, with American actor John Malkovich, Taiwanese actress Shuya Chang, and Chilean actor Marko Zaror. 100 Years is apparently a short film. Rodriguez stated in a 2019 interview: \"I was making several short films for them, and I finished that one first, we shot that one first, I thought that was gonna be a commercial or something. And then I showed them the movie and they said 'Yeah, that's great, that's great. That's the one we lock away.' And I said 'What? That's the one you lock away? What about the other one with the future--' 'No, that's the commercial.'

The movie's editing juxtaposes African depictions of Western traits around Treichville with their pervasive influence on the subjects' dream lives. As a Frenchman, Jean Rouch was acutely aware of the heavy cultural weight placed upon him in capturing life for Nigerien immigrants.\n\n The Lost Continent is a 1968 adventure film made by Hammer Films and Seven Arts featuring Eric Porter, Hildegard Knef, Suzanna Leigh, Tony Beckley, and James Cossins. The film was produced, directed and written by Michael Carreras based on Dennis Wheatley's novel Uncharted Seas (1938). The film was called \"the strangest film to come out of the Hammer Studios\". The film sees the crew and passengers of the dilapidated tramp steamer Corita heading from Freetown to Caracas. While the passengers all have their own reasons for getting out of Africa, the captain of the ship is also eager to leave, as he is smuggling a dangerous explosive cargo. Whilst en route to South America the ship is holed and eventually what's left of the crew and passengers find themselves marooned in a mist-enshrouded Sargasso Sea surrounded by killer seaweed, murderous crustaceans and previously marooned descendants of Spanish Conquistadores and pirates.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who was born earlier, Buffet Froid or Lost In Africa?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Frank Beardsley is a widowed U.S. Coast Guard rear admiral who moves back to his hometown of New London, Connecticut with his eight kids from his previous marriage.

Her sisters are Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten, Neferneferuaten Tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. Meritaten is mentioned in diplomatic letters, by the name Mayati. She is mentioned in a letter from Abimilki of Tyre. The reference usually is thought to date to the period when Meritaten's position at court became more important, during the latter part of the reign of Akhenaten. It is possible, however, that the letter refers to the birth of Meritaten. She was married to Pharaoh Smenkhare. Inscriptions mention a young princess named Meritaten Tasherit, who may be the daughter of Meritaten and Smenkhare. Inscriptions from Ashmunein suggest that Meritaten-tasherit is the daughter of Meritaten. The scene dates to the reign of Akhenaten, and this means the father of the young princess could be Akhenaten. If so, this means Akhenaten took his own daughters as wives. Another princess named Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit had been suggested as an additional daughter of Meritaten, but it is more likely that she is a daughter of Ankhesenpaaten.\n\n Meritites II was probably a daughter of Khufu, as she was said to be a King's daughter of his body and as the location of her tomb indicates a relation to Khufu. She was a Prophetess of Khufu, Hathor and Neith. Meritites was married to Akhethotep, who was a director of the palace. Further titles of Akhethotep include Sole friend, Priest of the Bas of Nekhen, and Overseer of fishers/ fowlers. In the tomb several children are depicted. A block formerly in the McGregor collection, but now in Lisbon shows two daughters. One daughter is named Hetepheres and only a partial name has been preserved for the second girl: Khufu[...].\n\n el-Gasus (Deir el-Bahari) and are now in Cairo. ; Meritamen, Chantress of Amun.

Menkheperre's eldest full brother Masaharta followed their father Pinedjem I \n\n  Meritites II (Merytiotes, Meritetes) or Meritites A (\"beloved of her father\") was a 4th Dynasty princess of ancient Egypt, probably a daughter of King Khufu. She may have been a daughter of Meritites I based on the fact that this queen is mentioned in mastaba G 7650. She married the Director of the Palace, Akhethotep (a non-royal court official), and she had several children with her husband. Meritites and her husband shared a mastaba G 7650 in Giza.\n\n Meritaten Tasherit, which means Meritaten the Younger was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th Dynasty. She is likely to have been the daughter of Meritaten, eldest daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Who her father was remains a matter of debate. Many assume it to be Meritaten's father, Akhenaten, or possibly her husband Smenkhkare. Since both Meritaten Tasherit and another princess, Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child. Meritaten Tasherit's fate is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt's traditional gods. The name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.\n\nQuestion: Where did Meritaten's father die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was knighted during the reign of Edward IV by Richard, Duke of Gloucester on 24 August 1482 at the capture of Berwick upon Tweed. On 17 April 1483 he was one of the pall-bearers at Edward IV's funeral. His father's marriage with Henry of Richmond's mother and services at the battle of Bosworth gained Henry's favour for the family, when he became King Henry VII.

He was the youngest son of Duke Reginald II of Guelders and his second wife, Eleanor of Woodstock, daughter of King Edward II of England. In 1350, with encouragement from his mother, Edward began a devastating civil war against his brother Reginald III for control of the Duchy of Guelders. Edward led the Bronkhorster (civil) faction which in 1361 in a battle at Tiel defeated the Heekeren (aristocratic) faction, led by Edward's incapable brother who was captured and imprisoned.

He was baptised at St. Pancras Church, Euston, and spent his early childhood at the northern London suburb of Muswell Hill, to which the family moved soon after his birth. His father later acquired a lease on the grand Tudor manor house Sutton Place near Guildford, Surrey, in 1874, which descended to his elder son Sidney, and about which Frederic jnr. wrote the definitive history Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place, Guildford, first published in 1893. His paternal grandfather was a Leicestershire builder. In 1840 the family moved again to 22 Oxford Square, Hyde Park, London, a house designed by Harrison's father.

In August 1778 she became engaged to, and then married, another banker, Bernhardt Friedrich von Türckheim, and her name became \"Lilli\" von Türckheim. Before that happened, however, between January and October 1775 she was engaged in an intense love affair with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, described in one source as his \"first great love\". Memories lingered: towards the end of his life, conversing with his young friend Frédéric Soret, Goethe recalled that he had loved  Lili profoundly and had never been so close to happiness as he was with her. She featured repeatedly in his written work, identified simply as \"Lili\" or, according to some sources, as \"Lilli\". Lili Schönemann's descendants include the comedienne Charlotte de Turckheim.\n\n had seven children. Achim died in 1831, but Bettina maintained an active public life. Her passion for Goethe revived, and in 1835, after lengthy discussions with the writer and landscape gardener Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, she published her book Goethe's Correspondence with a Child (Goethes Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde), which purported to be a correspondence between herself and the poet. The book is in large part fictitious. Genuine sonnets of Goethe in it were addressed, not to her, but to Minna Herzlieb. As a work of fiction, the book has been praised. She continued to write, inspire, and publish until 20 January 1859, when she died in Berlin, aged 73, surrounded by her children. Her grave is in the Wiepersdorf churchyard.\n\n Friedrich von Savigny, the famous jurist, at Marburg. She formed a friendship with Karoline von Günderrode. The two friends acknowledged only natural impulses, laws, and methods of life, and brooded over the \"tyranny\" of conventionalities. In 1806, Günderrode committed suicide on account of a passion for the philologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. In 1807 at Weimar Bettina made the acquaintance of Goethe, for whom she entertained a significant passion, which the poet did not requite, though he entered into correspondence with her. Their friendship came to an abrupt end in 1811, owing to Bettina's behaviour with Goethe's wife. In 1811, Bettina married Achim von Arnim, the renowned Romantic poet. The couple settled first at the Wiepersdorf castle, and then in Berlin. \n\n contacting her former lover appears to have been to request (without success) his protection for a young acquaintance. From Goethe's diary entry of 1. October 1806 it is also apparent that she mentioned to him her younger son William, who at the time was participating as a Hussar Lieutenant in Napoleon's campaigns in Germany, Spain and Russia. (William survived the experience. ) Aged 58, \"Lilli\" von Türckheim died at Krautergersheim on 6 May 1817. She was buried alongside her husband in the heart of the village in a little chapel which has subsequently acquired the address 12, Rue Clemenceau.\n\n Freiherrn von Künsberg, who returned her affections in secret. When Wilhelm's wife died she lived with him at her Spiering castle Schloss Fronberg, and he left the cuirassiers at her behest. Caroline's husband Carl Theodor tolerated the relationship but refused her an official separation, even going so far as to have her legitimate and illegitimate children educated together. Only Carl Theodor's death cleared Caroline's way to marry Wilhelm, which she did on 21 September 1857 at the Wallfahrtskirche auf dem Kreuzberg in Schwandorf. Her illegitimate children were legitimized during her lifetime and on 7 July 1859 they were raised to the Bavarian Freiherrenstand with the title Künsberg Freiherr von Fronberg. She died at the Schloss at Fronberg and was buried there in a sarcophagus in a room adjacent to the castle chapel.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Christiane Vulpius's husband?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bhakta Prahlada was completed on 15 September 1931, which henceforth became known as \"Telugu Film Day\" to commemorate its completion. Popularly known as talkies, films with sound quickly grew in number and popularity. In 1934, the industry saw its first major commercial success with Lavakusa. Directed by C. Pullaiah and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theatres and thrust the young industry into mainstream culture. By 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes. That year, under the direction of Krithiventi Nageswara Rao, Prema Vijayam, a film focusing on social issues, was released. Its success prompted the production of dozens of other immensely successful 'social films', notably 1939's Vandemataram, touching on societal problems like the practice of giving dowry, Telugu films increasingly focused on contemporary living: 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 had social themes.\n\n In April 2011, a male Iranian \"illegal refugee\" who had been denied refugee status in the Netherland but for whom it was unsafe to return to their own country committed suicide by burning himself in the crowded city centre in Amsterdam and died one day later in the hospital.

Apparently, the subject the man is being assessed in is Psychology of women, so hence the unisexual university board. The man is yet again told he has failed completely in the subject, and as he exits the university he is identified as Cheng (Ekin Cheng) by his colleagues. Not giving up, Cheng decides to continue with the subject, but at this time, his girlfriend decides to end their relationship.

Mel Gibson stars as \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky, a police officer-turned-vigilante in a near-future Australia in the midst of societal collapse. Joanne Samuel, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Steve Bisley, Tim Burns, and Roger Ward also star. James McCausland and Miller wrote the screenplay from a story by Miller and Kennedy. Principal photography for Mad Max took place in and around Melbourne, and lasted for six weeks. The film initially received a polarized reception upon its release in April 1979, although it won four AACTA Awards. Filmed on a budget of A$400,000, it earned more than US$100 million worldwide in gross revenue and held the  Guinness record for most profitable film. The success of Mad Max has been credited for further opening up the global market to Australian New Wave films. The film became the first in the Mad Max series, giving rise to three sequels: Mad Max 2 (1981), Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and Fury Road (2015). In 2020 a fifth film, to be titled Furiosa, was announced.\n\n Mad Max 2 (released as The Road Warrior in the United States) is a 1981 Australian post-apocalyptic action thriller film directed by George Miller. It is the second installment in the Mad Max franchise, with Mel Gibson reprising his role as \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky. The film's tale of a community of settlers who moved to defend themselves against a roving band of marauders follows an archetypical \"Western\" frontier movie motif, as does Max's role as a hardened man who rediscovers his humanity when he decides to help the settlers. Filming took place in locations around Broken Hill, in the outback of New South \n\n Ab Tak Chhappan 2 opens to encounter specialist Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) proclaiming what he did was right. The film then goes into flashback, where we are shown what happened a few months back. Away from Mumbai, with a few cases pending against him, Sadhu now leads a peaceful life in his village (Goa) with his son Aman, mourning the loss of his wife. He cooks, lives in a house by the river and listens to his son playing the piano. However, his retired phase comes to a halt, when the ex-police commissioner (Mohan Agashe) convinces Sadhu to get back on the job \n\n by Paul Hogan's fabulously successful Crocodile Dundee (1986). By 1990, the mania had long since subsided, and this film's Australian setting did nothing to enhance its box office appeal. Further, the film doesn't make particularly imaginative use of the location. Take away the accents and the obligatory kangaroos and koalas, and the story could have taken place anywhere. Another problem is that 'the rescuers' themselves don't even enter the action until a third of the film has passed. And when they do appear, they don't have much to do with the main plot until near the film's end.

The company later expanded to include Matt Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Steven Kostanski, who are now equal partners in the company. Astron-6 is known for producing low-budget, 1980s-centric independent movies that often combine horror with comedy. A planned 2012 documentary No Sleep, No Surrender, which detailed the making and production of their 2011 film Father's Day, was never completed, though a teaser trailer was released. The follow-up to Father's Day, a Giallo-inspired horror comedy, The Editor, was directed by Adam Brooks and Matthew Kennedy in 2014. In 2016, Astron-6 produced the web series Divorced Dad. The series was described by the filmmakers as 'a love letter to the endearingly incompetent cable access television shows created by far from screen-ready small town celebrities during the 1980s and 90s'. Gillespie and Kostanski directed the 2016 horror film The Void, intended as a departure from Astron-6's more comedic work.

Coming from a Greek immigrant family herself, Kokkinos's work often deals with themes of identity and family. Her next film was the 50-minute short feature Only The Brave (1994), which won several awards. This film follows Alex as she helplessly watches her best friend Vicki fall victim to her self-destructive tendencies.\n\n Sam Irvin (born June 14, 1956) is an American film and television director, producer, screenwriter, actor, author and film teacher.

MDDS has no treatment and usually causes death in infancy. The case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in the best interests of the child. The case has been classified by legal academics as a 'stigmata case', cases that \"are part of the meditation of a culture upon itself.\"\n\nIn October 2016, Charlie was transferred to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), a National Health Service (NHS) children's hospital, because he was failing to thrive and his breathing was shallow. He was placed on mechanical ventilation and MDDS was diagnosed. A neurologist in New York, Michio Hirano, who was working on an experimental treatment based on nucleoside supplementation with human MDDS patients was contacted. He and GOSH agreed to proceed with the treatment, to be conducted at GOSH and paid for by the NHS. Hirano was invited to come to the hospital to examine Charlie but did not visit at that time. In January, after Charlie had seizures that caused brain damage, GOSH formed the view that further treatment was futile and might prolong suffering. They began discussions with the parents about ending life support and providing palliative care.\n\nCharlie's parents still wanted to try the experimental treatment and raised funds for a transfer to a hospital in New York. In February 2017, GOSH asked the High Court to override the parents' decision, questioning the potential of nucleoside therapy to treat Charlie's condition. The British courts supported GOSH's position. The parents appealed the case to the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The decision of the court at first instance was upheld at each appeal. In July 2017, after receiving a letter signed by several international practitioners defending the potential of the treatment and claiming to provide new evidence, GOSH applied to the High Court for a new hearing. Hirano visited Charlie at GOSH during the second hearing of the case at the request of the judge. After examining scans of Charlie's muscles, Hirano determined it was too late for the treatment to help Charlie and the parents agreed to the withdrawal of life support. GOSH maintained its position throughout that Charlie's condition had deteriorated by January to the extent that the proposed experimental treatment was futile. The second hearing at the High Court, which had been arranged to hear and examine the new evidence then became concerned with the arrangements for the withdrawal of life support. On 27 July, by consent, Charlie was transferred to a hospice, mechanical ventilation was withdrawn, and he died the next day at the age of 11 months and 24 days.\n\nThe case attracted widespread attention in Britain and around the world, with expressions of concern and assistance offered by figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis. At the time of Charlie's death, The Washington Post wrote that the case \"became the embodiment of a passionate debate over his right to live or die, his parents' right to choose for their child and whether his doctors had an obligation to intervene in his care\".\n\nTreatment \nCharles Matthew William Gard was born on 4 August 2016, at full term and normal weight, to Christopher Gard, a postman, and Constance Yates, a carer for young people with learning difficulties, both of Bedfont, west London. He seemed to develop normally at first, but his parents noticed after a few weeks that he was less able to lift his head, and they took him to his GP. On 2 October 2016, they reported that he was being breastfed every 2–3 hours but was not gaining weight. He was fed a high-calorie formula through a nasogastric tube, an ECG was carried out, and  a cranial MRI scan was performed on 7 October.\n\nOn 11 October, Charlie was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and put on a mechanical ventilator, because his breathing had become shallow. By November, the doctors suspected that he had mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS), a set of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes essential for mitochondria to function. This diagnosis was confirmed by a genetic test in mid-November, which found that he had two mutated versions of the gene coding for the RRM2B protein.\n\nThe gene for RRM2B is in the cell nucleus; the protein it codes is necessary for generating nucleosides that are used to make deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in mitochondria. The mitochondria fail in people lacking a functional version of this protein, causing brain damage, muscle weakness (including of the muscles used to breathe) and organ failure, and usually leading to death during infancy. Only 15 other cases of MDDS caused by mutations in RRM2B have been recorded. , there was only one experimental treatment for MDDS based on nucleoside supplementation, used on mice and human patients carrying a mutation in a different gene (TK2), which also impairs the synthesis of nucleosides in mitochondria causing a less severe form of MDDS.\n\nThe hospital's ethics committee advised in November 2016 that Charlie should not be given a tracheostomy. In mid-December, he began having persistent seizures as his brain function deteriorated. He had become deaf, his heart and kidneys were failing, and he could no longer breathe or move independently. It was unclear whether he could feel pain.\n\nExperimental nucleoside treatment \n\nIn December 2016, Michio Hirano, chief of the Division of Neuromuscular Disorders at Columbia University Medical Center, and an attending neurologist at New York–Presbyterian Hospital, who had worked on nucleoside therapy in collaboration with researchers in Italy, Spain and Central America, administering the therapy to 18 human patients, was contacted.\n\nCharlie's records were sent electronically to Hirano on 30 December, and he and a member of the GOSH medical team discussed the case by telephone. Both doctors agreed that the experimental treatment was unlikely to help if there was irreversible brain damage. Hirano and the GOSH medical team continued to email and discuss the treatment by telephone. Hirano said there was a \"theoretical possibility\" that the treatment would provide some benefit, but that he needed a baseline MRI to rule out \"severe brain involvement\". An MRI was performed and seemed to show no structural damage to the brain.\n\nOn 9 January 2017, notes kept by GOSH doctors recorded that the team intended to attempt the nucleoside treatment at GOSH in the next few weeks. One of the doctors applied to the hospital's ethics committee for approval. A committee meeting was scheduled for 13 January, and Charlie was provisionally scheduled for a tracheostomy on 16 January. GOSH invited Hirano to examine him in January, but he did not examine Charlie until July.\n\nOn 9 or 10 January, Charlie began having epileptic seizures, which continued until 27 January. These were deemed likely to have caused epileptic encephalopathy (brain damage), and the 13 January ethics committee meeting was postponed. On 13 January, the GOSH doctors informed Charlie's parents that the brain damage had made the experimental treatment futile, and in light of the risk that he was suffering, they withdrew their support for it.\n\nTermination of life support proposed and opposed \nGOSH began discussing with the parents the ending of life support and the provision of palliative care. By this time, relations between the parents and the doctors had deteriorated. One GOSH doctor emailed another: \"Parents are spanner in the works. Recent deterioration with worsening seizures means trial is not in his best interests.\" The email emerged in the subsequent court case; the judge said that he understood the distress it had caused the parents, but that it was important to view the email in the context of notes passed between consultants about Charlie's best interests. The parents disagreed with the doctors at GOSH; they wanted to take him to New York to receive the nucleoside treatment.\n\nReactions\nOn 30 January 2017, the parents launched an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe to finance experimental treatment in the United States. Donations had exceeded £1.3 million by the end of April. The publicity campaign was well under way before the legal process had started.  At no time during the court process was any criticism levelled at the parents for this campaign and there was no suggestion that the court's powers be used to limit or control this publicity.\n\nIn June, immediately after the High Court had ruled that artificial life support should be withdrawn, the parents said that they wanted to take their son home to die or to bring him to a hospice, and that GOSH had denied this; the hospital would not comment due to Charlie's confidentiality. It was announced that his life support would be withdrawn on 30 June. The courts, and GOSH and its staff were subjected to criticism and abuse. On 30 June, the staff at the hospital agreed to give the parents more time with him.\n\nThree days earlier, the appeal process finished when the European Court of Human Rights declined to hear the case and shortly after offers of assistance and expressions of support were made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Congressmen Brad Wenstrup and Trent Franks announced that they intended to introduce legislation granting lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. to Charlie Gard and his family. \"Our bill will support Charlie's parents' right to choose what is best for their son, by making Charlie a lawful permanent resident in the U.S. in order for him to receive treatments that could save his life. Should this little boy be ordered to die – because a third party, overriding the wishes of his parents, believes it can conclusively determine that immediate death is what is best for him?\" Trump said the U.S. would be \"delighted to help\", Pence called Charlie's case \"heartbreaking\" and said that \"the American people oughta(sic) reflect on the fact that for all the talk on the left about single-payer, that's where it takes us\". The case was cited in the American press and social media as evidence in the debate there about the Administration's promise to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Some commentators in the United States erroneously argued that Charlie's plight was the result of the UK having a state-run national health service and that the decision to withdraw Charlie's life support was driven by cost. In London Alasdair Seton-Marsden, who acted as a spokesman for the parents until they distanced themselves from him, was criticised for using parental rights rhetoric, calling Charlie \"a prisoner of the state\". Pro-life groups in the United States became involved in the controversy, with US groups demonstrating outside the London court.\n\nThe Vatican issued a statement on 2 July affirming that \"we should never act with the deliberate intention to end a human life\" but that \"we must also accept the limits of medicine\". Pope Francis expressed solidarity with the parents, and said that their wishes should be respected, and human life should be protected. The Pope's remarks were widely reported as evidence that the Pope had altered the Vatican's position. It was said that the Pope offered citizenship. On 6 July, New York–Presbyterian Hospital issued a statement offering either to admit Charlie for treatment in New York or to provide the drug and advice to GOSH staff for the treatment in London. In a letter that was made public, was presented to and rejected by the Court of Appeal and was sent to GOSH, Hirano and other doctors claimed to be able to provide new evidence to support the view that Charlie should be given nucleoside treatment. A few days after the European court ruling on 28 June, the parents' solicitor wrote to GOSH arguing that the hospital had a duty to apply for a new hearing. Two other hospitals were willing to offer treatment; the Vatican-owned Bambino Gesù Hospital in Rome, and Hirano's New York–Presbyterian Hospital. The letter said that Hirano had new basic research findings that he judged made it more likely that the nucleoside therapy could help. At no time did Hirano or the New York hospital claim or imply that it was necessary to send Charlie to the United States; the experimental treatment could be administered at the GOSH, subject to the agreements in London of the ethics committee and in the United States of the FDA. The ethics committee in London had declined consent and there is no public record of an application to the FDA being made. The parents said these expressions of support had given them new hope.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, GOSH made application for the case to return to the High Court. In a public statement, GOSH explained why it had applied: \"Two international hospitals and their researchers have communicated to us as late as the last 24 hours that they have fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment. And we believe, in common with Charlie's parents, it is right to explore this evidence\". The hospital stated it was bound by the previous ruling of the High Court, which expressly forbade them from transferring Charlie for nucleoside therapy anywhere, and the application was made to ask the Court to reconsider the case after weighing the evidence regarding the treatment, and specifically, its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier to treat Charlie's encephalopathy.  In its application to the High Court for a second hearing GOSH said that the parents, through their solicitors \"not for the first time raised the prospect of criminal proceedings against the hospital and its staff\".\n\nLegal proceedings \nThe court proceedings were under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court (wardship), conducted within the principles and provisions of the Children Act 1989.\n\nIn wardship, the High Court assumes parental rights and responsibilities if an application is made and the court deems the application appropriate. Parents and public bodies have a responsibility to take actions in the best interests of a child. Doctors treat children with the consent of parents; treatment of a child without parental consent potentially exposes the treating doctor to criminal prosecution. If a public body believes a parental decision will cause significant harm to a child, it must ask the courts to intervene to override the parents' decision. It is the duty of the court under its inherent jurisdiction to ensure that a child who is the subject of proceedings is protected and properly taken care of. There is a presumption for transparency in these cases as the justified interference with article 8 rights of a minor will always require public scrutiny at some point. The law in respect of transparency in wardship and inherent jurisdiction cases is complex.\n\nThe principles and provisions of the Children Act 1989 that are particularly relevant to this case are:\n the definitions of parental rights and responsibilities,\n the paramountcy and the definition of the child's best interests,\n the \"no order\" principle and\n the \"no delay\" principle\n\nIn essence, GOSH had applied for a Specific Issue Order under section 8 of the Act to enable life support to be withdrawn. GOSH believed this to be in Charlie's best interests but his parents did not. The judge dealt with the case throughout by Declarations; at no stage of the proceedings was any Mandatory Order made. This caused problems both for GOSH, described in their later formal application of 7 Julysee below and for the Supreme Court.see below\n\nFirst directions hearings \nOn 24 February 2017, GOSH asked the High Court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction. GOSH sought orders:\n That Charlie lacked capacity to make decisions regarding his medical treatment;\n That artificial ventilation be withdrawn;\n That it is lawful for his treating clinicians to provide him with palliative care only; and\n That it is lawful, and in Charlie's best interests, not to undergo nucleoside therapy.\n\nThe case came before the court on 3 March. It was then listed for final hearing on 3 April to enable the parents to file their evidence, and in particular to obtain evidence from the USA, as to the treatment that might possibly be available for Charlie.\n\nThe parents were not automatically eligible for legal aid; it is unclear whether they would have been eligible under an exemption, but they did not apply to the Legal Aid Agency. They were represented by a pro bono legal team, which the judge later characterized as \"experienced and dedicated\" and as providing \"excellent assistance\". Charlie was joined as a party and a guardian ad litem was appointed under the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). In this way the first of GOSH's applications was granted by consent. Victoria Butler-Cole, a barrister, represented the guardian. The Telegraph later reported that the parents \"privately expressed their concern\" when they realised that Butler-Cole is the chair of Compassion in Dying, a sister organisation of Dignity in Dying.\n\nAt this stage agreed reporting restriction orders were in place to protect the anonymity of the medical team and those that have given second opinions, both from the UK and abroad. The restrictions in respect of Hirano were lifted by consent at the second hearing.\n\nFirst evidential hearing \nThe first hearing took place on 3, 5, 7 and 11 April at what was then thought to be a full and final hearing. The court heard testimony from two doctors and two nurses from GOSH, four doctors from whom GOSH had sought second opinions, from a doctor appointed as expert witness by the parents with the court's permission, and from Hirano by telephone from the US. All of the UK doctors bar one gave written and oral evidence; one gave written evidence only. Doctors from GOSH testified that withdrawing treatment complied with Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines.<ref\nname=FrancisDecision201704 /> The conclusions of the doctor appointed by the parents was said by the judge to coincide with the opinions of the other UK doctors.\n\nOf the evidence of the UK doctors the judge said:\n\nthe entire highly experienced UK team, all those who provided second opinions and the consultant instructed by the parents in these proceedings share a common view that further treatment would be futile.\n\nHirano testified, like the other doctors involved, anonymously. He described his work with people and mice with the TK2-mutation form of MDDS, reporting that the patients under the treatment improved muscular strength, becoming less dependent on ventilators, and did not develop seizures compared to those not receiving nucleoside supplements.  He said the therapy was unlikely to reverse structural brain damage, but that if the case were at his hospital, he would be willing to offer the treatment if the parents so desired and could pay for it, but he would defer first to the intensive care unit to make the decision.\n\nHirano had not seen Charlie but had had access to the medical records. Hirano had discussed the case on the telephone with some of the UK doctors and these discussions were relayed to the court. The judge quoted from Hirano's evidence\n\nIt is very difficult for me never having seen him, being across the Atlantic and seeing bits of information. I appreciate how unwell he is. His EEG is very severe. I think he is in the terminal stage of his illness. I can appreciate your position. I would just like to offer what we can. It is unlikely to work, but the alternative is that he will pass away.\n\nOf Hirano's evidence, the judge said:\n\nThe long and the short of Dr. (Hirano's) evidence is that there is no scientific evidence of any prospect of any improvement in a human with RRM2B strain of MDDS. While there were some reasons to be hopeful that it might make a modest difference to life expectancy, it almost certainly could not undo structural brain damage.\n\nThe parents testified that they believed the nucleoside therapy could work, and that his brain damage was not as severe as the doctors thought. Whilst none of those giving evidence could be certain whether or not Charlie could experience pain the consensus was that he could but that he was not able to express feelings of pain.\n\nThe court appointed guardian testified that because of the risk that Charlie was in pain, and the low chance that the treatment would work, it was in his best interests to withdraw mechanical ventilation.\nOn 11 April, Mr Justice Francis ruled by Declaration that he acceded to GOSH's application. It was in Charlie's best interests to withdraw mechanical ventilation and provide palliative care only and he refused the parents permission to appeal.  The next day solicitors for the parents announced that they were considering the terms of the judgement; the parents had less than three weeks to lodge an appeal. Notice of Appeal was issued on 2 May and the case came before the Court of Appeal on 22 and 23 May.\n\nAppeals\n\nCourt of Appeal \nBy Notice, the parents, represented by a completely different legal team also acting pro bono, sought leave to appeal the High Court ruling on five grounds:\n\n The judge erred in making an order that prevented Charlie from receiving medical treatment by expert physicians in a reputable hospital overseas in circumstances where there was no risk of that treatment causing significant harm to Charlie.\n Per Re King, the court may not interfere with a decision by parents in the exercise of their parental rights and responsibilities with regard to their child's medical treatment, save where there is a risk the parents' proposed course of action may cause significant harm. Re King is good law. It is consistent with prior authorities and correct as a matter of principle. It was cited in argument but not addressed at all in the judgment.\n The judge had no jurisdiction to grant an order on the application of one clinical team preventing a second clinical team from carrying out a treatment that the latter had offered in the reasonable exercise of its professional judgment. The declaration made by the judge has de facto injunctive effect in that it prevents Charlie's parents from removing from GOSH to undergo treatment in the USA.\n The judge would have had no power to grant such an injunction, had one been sought. It is no part of GOSH's statutory function to prevent other clinical teams from carrying out reasonable treatments. GOSH has nevertheless obtained an order with substantially the same effect\n The judge fell into error in conducting the ordinary \"best interests\" evaluation.\n No, or insufficient, regard was had to the relevant rights of Charlie and the parents under Articles 2, 5 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n The parents and their legal team were placed at an unfair procedural disadvantage as a result of the late disclosure of documents.\n\nThe court granted permission for the parents to appeal on ground 1, 2 and 4, and refused permission for ground 3 (no prospect of success), and ground 5 (no evidence). Having refused permission to appeal on ground three, the court went on to assess grounds 1, 2 and 4 on the basis that the judge at first instance had correctly evaluated Charlie's best interests and the lack of any identifiable benefit for him arising from nucleoside treatment.  A letter dated 22 May from Hirano was submitted to the court as \"fresh evidence\". The court read the letter and noted its contents but stated \"It is, however, plain that the letter does not purport to contain anything new\".   By grounds 1 and 2 the parents attempted to establish a \"wholly new point of law\" – all previously decided and reported medical treatment of children cases, save and except for that of Re King, should be regarded as \"Category 1\", whilst Re King established a \"Category 2\". In a \"Category 1\" case the parents who oppose the course of treatment for which the treating clinicians apply, and do not have a viable alternative therapeutic option to put before the court. The distinction that would lead a case to be allocated to \"Category 2\" is that a viable alternative treatment option is put forward by the parents and the court is, therefore, required to choose between the two. The court rejected this argument.  The judge at first instance was required to evaluate Charlie's best interests and had done so. Lord Justice McFarlane said \"On the facts of this case in my view, Mr Gordon's submission, unfortunately for the parents, does not even begin to have traction.  The submission is based upon there being a viable alternative form of treatment available.\"  Of the \"wholly new point of law\" Lord Justice McFarlane said \"If, contrary to my primary reading, Mr Justice Baker did intend to state, where a parent puts forward a viable option for treatment, that the High Court only has jurisdiction to interfere with a parent's choice of that medical treatment if the child is likely to suffer significant harm as a result, then, in my view, such a statement has no foundation as a matter of law, is contrary to established authority and is therefore plainly in error.\" As the appeal on grounds 1 and 2 were dismissed so the appeal on ground 4 fell.  The parents' appeal was dismissed.\n\nSupreme Court \nOn 8 June, at an oral hearing, a panel of three justices at the Supreme Court heard an application by the parents for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The parents argued that in this sort of case the hospital can only interfere in the decision taken by the parents if the child is otherwise likely to suffer significant harm and that decisions taken by parents who agree with one another are non-justiciable; that parents and parents alone are the judges of their child's best interests. Any other approach would interfere with their status their rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Of this the court said that applications such as this are governed by statute; the welfare of the child shall be the paramount consideration. This provision reflects but is stronger than Article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Also, where there is a significant dispute about a child's best interests the child himself must have an independent voice in that dispute and in this case Charlie has been represented by a guardian.\n\nPermission to appeal was refused on the grounds that there was no arguable point of law; the court also ordered reporting restrictions.\n\nThe matter again came before the Supreme Court on 19 June.  The parents had applied to the European Court of Human Rights.  That court routinely joins the relevant National Government to the case and it had requested the government to apply for a stay of the Declarations of the judge at first instance. The court sought that the judge's declarations be stayed to allow it time to hear the appeal. The Supreme Court had said at its earlier hearing that it had no authority in respect of a Declaration, additionally the application to stay caused it to face the unique dilemma of, in effect, acting against Charlie's best interests.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights \nOn 19 June the parents lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights. The application was heard on 27 June and declared inadmissible.\n\nSecond directions and evidential hearings \nOn 7 July, GOSH applied to the High Court for a further hearing. The formal application asked the court to evaluate the claims made about new evidence and it set out the difficulties that the hospital had experienced with the Declarations made by the judge on 11 April.\n\nOn Monday 10 July, the case again came before Mr Justice Francis. GOSH disputed claims made by Charlie's parents that there was new evidence; it had been forced to come back to court after lawyers for the parents had threatened judicial review. The parents asked for a further full hearing in two weeks time and they asked the judge to step down on the basis that he had already made up his mind. These applications were both rejected. The judge said he was the best person to evaluate any new evidence; he had heard the case thus far and he promised the parents a fair hearing.  He would deal with the case on the basis of evidence not tweets.  He expressed an understanding of the parents position \"I understand parents will grasp at any possibility of hope.\" Of the requested two-week delay he said \"doctors and nurses were under 'extreme strain' with the case dragging on ... Staff feel it is desperately unfair to Charlie ... week after week knowing that every step they take for Charlie is against his welfare.\" Directions were given for a further hearing on Thursday 13 July, asking the parents to set out any new evidence they had on the day before.\n\nOn 13 and 14 July the parents' fresh evidence, set out in a letter sent by the parents' legal team to GOSH a few days after the decision of the European court, was presented to the court. The new evidence was summarised as:\n\n the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome is willing to accept the transfer of Charlie;\n Dr. Hirano and the associated medical centre in the USA remain willing to accept the transfer of Charlie;\n on the basis of new laboratory findings, Dr. Hirano considers:\n the likelihood of a positive effect and benefits to Charlie of the proposed nucleoside therapy to be markedly improved compared to the views expressed in court;\n the likelihood that the proposed nucleoside therapy will cross the blood brain barrier to be significantly enhanced.\n\nIn spite of these assertions, Dr. Hirano had still not seen Charlie, had never physically assessed Charlie nor had he had sight of his medical records and investigations, including the second opinions of doctors from outside GOSH. The judge later said of this \"It seems to me to be a remarkably simple proposition that if a doctor is to give evidence to this court about the prospect of effective treatment in respect of a child whose future is being considered by the court, that Dr should see the patient before the court can sensibly rely upon his evidence.\"  Hirano gave evidence by videolink from America. By consent, the reporting restrictions of his identity were lifted and he agreed to travel to London to examine Charlie and to take part in a conference with the GOSH medical team and other experts. Mr Justice Francis arranged to hear further evidence after a medical conference of experts from around the world, including Hirano had been conducted on 17 July. The judge said he would issue a new ruling on 25 July, after he had received and reviewed the conference report. The judge said of the report that there was a considerable degree of consensus but further MRI scans were needed to establish whether the position that GOSH had for some time been maintaining is correct. It transpired that in some places Charlie had no muscle and in other places there is significant replacement of muscle by fat. On 24 July, the barrister representing Chris Gard and Connie Yates withdrew their request to fly their son to New York and their challenge to withdrawing mechanical ventilation and proceeding with palliative care. He added that Chris and Connie had made the decision on 21 July but had wanted to spend the weekend with their son without media attention.\n\nOn 24 July, Mr Justice Francis said \"Given the consensus that now exists between parents, the treating doctors and even Dr Hirano, it is my very sad duty to confirm the declarations that I made in April this year, and I now formally do so. I do not make a Mandatory Order.\"\n\nIn spite of the consensus identified by the judge at the end of the five-day hearing, it was at times acrimonious.  The judge had been asked to step down and responded in his written judgement in what was seen as a swipe against U.S. President Trump, who had tweeted about the case. On the last day Connie Yates made a statement to the court from the witness box. This statement  and GOSH's position statement and press releases of 24 and 27 July make clear the distance that remained between the parents and the hospital medical team. The parents accused GOSH of delaying treatment until it was too late, with the mother complaining that the world-renowned children's hospital had \"wasted time\" in refusing to allow doctors from abroad to treat her son. The parents later accused the hospital of blocking their 'final wish' for Charlie to be allowed home to die.\n\nCharlie's parents wanted to move him to private care and wanted to wait a \"week or so\" before they ended mechanical ventilation. The hospital objected on the basis that he needed intensive care and that mechanical ventilation should be ended soon. The case returned to the judge on 25 and 26 July. The parents, the hospital and the guardian had explored five different plans and proposals for Charlie's final care and had explored all the various practical and logistic complications.  The parties had been unable to reach agreement. The judge then set out by Declaration that the following arrangements be implemented:\n\n Charlie shall continue to be treated at GOSH for the period of the Confidential Annexe hereto\n Charlie shall be transferred to an agreed hospice the details of which are set out in a Confidential Annexe\n It is lawful for artificial ventilation to be withdrawn after a period set out in the Confidential Annexe\n\nFurther directions were given to protect the confidentiality of the arrangements and to prevent reporting or publishing any information that would lead to identification.\n\nOutcome\nOn 27 July 2017 Charlie was transferred to a hospice and the next day his mother announced at 6:30 pm that he had died. The mechanical ventilator had been withdrawn; he was given morphine to relieve any pain beforehand, and died within minutes.\n\nIssues\n\nPolitical and public policy \nMedical experts criticised interventions by Hirano and others for raising the parents’ hopes and for causing delays to the process. Genetics expert Robert Winston said \"interferences from the Vatican and from Donald Trump\" were \"extremely unhelpful and very cruel\". Winston added: \"This child has been dealt with at a hospital which has huge expertise in mitochondrial disease and is being offered a break in a hospital that has never published anything on this disease, as far as I'm aware.\" Some commentators in the United States argued that Charlie's plight was the result of the UK having a state-run national health service and that the decision to withdraw Charlie's life support was driven by cost. The High Court judge described these comments as \"nonsensical\", adding that \"it was one of the pitfalls of social media that the watching world felt it right to have opinions without knowing the facts of the case\". The chairman of GOSH made a statement condemning \"thousands of abusive messages\", including death threats received by staff at the hospital and harassment of other families in the hospital over the preceding weeks. GOSH asked the Metropolitan Police Service to investigate the abuse. The parents issued a statement condemning harassment of GOSH staff and said they had also received abusive messages. GOSH released a statement criticising Hirano for offering testimony without having physically examined Charlie and without review of the medical records; they also said Hirano had disclosed that he had a financial interest in the treatment very late in the process. Hirano made a statement in response saying that he had relinquished his financial rights in the treatment.\n\nExperimental treatment \nA key issue in Charlie's case was access to experimental treatment. Requests for access to experimental treatment from patients or their family can sometimes occur when circumstances are dire. In the US the medical establishment handles these requests under \"expanded access\" or \"compassionate use\", which examines whether there is a reasonable chance of more benefit than harm for the patient; the extent of need; fairness; and the resources of everyone involved, including the people providing and administering the drug. US insurance companies generally do not pay for experimental treatment. In Charlie's case, the GOSH medical team initially decided to try the experimental treatment which would have been funded by the NHS, had it gone ahead.\n\nThe question was whether it was in Charlie's best interests to receive nucleoside therapy –\nwhether the benefits were likely to outweigh the harm. Because the therapy was unproven, and had never been tested on a patient with Charlie's condition, the GOSH medical team and the courts focused on whether it was plausible that there could be of any benefit. Hirano told the court that having seen 30 March EEG, the damage to Charlie's brain was more severe than he had thought. He said in his evidence that the treatment was unlikely to be of any benefit to Charlie's brain. He agreed that there could be no reversal of the structure of Charlie's brain. He said that the main functioning would be improvement of weakness; some patients had improved their upper strength and four of eight patients had been able to reduce their time on ventilators, but he agreed that the effect on brain function would be less or minimal or non-existent. He said that the chances of meaningful brain recovery would be small, he described the probability as low, but not zero; he agreed he could not distinguish from vanishingly small. He said that he thought that there was only a small chance of meaningful brain function. He said that he was \"in unchartered(sic)  territory, especially as we do not know how much structural damage there has been\". He conceded that to a large extent, if not altogether, the damage was irreversible. GOSH had determined that the chances of benefit to Charlie were vanishingly small, the effort would be futile and the treatment potentially painful for him.\n\nHospitals in the US make the same kind of plausibility analysis when they consider experimental treatment. New York–Presbyterian Hospital would have needed approval to give Charlie the nucleoside therapy under the US compassionate-use framework. Charlie's parents felt any chance to save his life was worth trying. Their attempt to take Charlie to New York began when the London Hospital did not obtain approval to administer the experimental treatment – there was no question of its medical or technical inability to administer the treatment.  Had Charlie travelled to New York a similar regulatory process would have been required. This point was not raised within the court process; the case proceeded, both in court and in the wider public debate, on the basis that the experimental treatment was not available in London but was available in New York.  In evidence in April Hirano had said that he would defer to \"ICU people\", i.e he would not administer the experimental treatment if the intensivists at his hospital advised against it, as the GOSH ethics committee had in November 2016 and intensivists at GOSH had in January 2016.\n\nAfter Charlie's death, The New York Times observed that only rarely is there such intense conflict between doctors and parents. CAFCASS reports that in England, it was involved in 18 parent-doctor disputes in 2016 that ended up in court. Hospitals discussed existing methods that have proved effective for avoiding disputes over children's care.\n\nMedical ethics \nSome medical ethicists saw the use of social media in this case as a challenge for their profession. Charlie's parents used social media to gain public support, but the medical team was limited in what it could say due to confidentiality obligations, and public opinion had no place in its decisions or procedures. During the court proceedings the ethical approaches to experimental treatment in the US and UK were compared in the media. Case law in the US has tended to favour families' perception of what is in their relative's best interests. Doctors in the US are less inclined to go to court when there are disagreements, but may find themselves providing care or treatment they believe is unethical. Some state law strongly favours families, but Texas, for example, allows doctors to bring cases to an ethics committee if they believe a treatment is futile, and they can be released from the obligation to provide such treatment.\n\nPublic and ethicist's commentary continued as the case progressed through the courts. The public commentary changed little. Apart from the political comments about socialised medicine, single-payer health systems etc., the majority of public comment concentrated on the rights of the parents to make the medical choices for their child; on what was seen as the usurping nature of the court case. There were many claims that the court decisions were ordering or sanctioning euthanasia.  The commentary of ethicists tended to change as the court process progressed.\n\nAutonomy \nSome ethicists said or implied either that the parents and the doctors should have agreed or that it was regrettable that they had not agreed or that they surely would have agreed had neither side had access to lawyers. Professor Julian Savulescu, Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, and Professor Dominic Wilkinson, Director of Medical Ethics at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and Consultant neonatologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford opined that it is necessary for a court to decide the issues in circumstances of disagreement between the parents and the doctors if the disagreement is unreasonable but if the disagreement is reasonable the parents' decisions should prevail. Richard Doerflinger, former Associate Director of Pro-Life Activities of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, views it differently; \"Catholic documents say the patient is the primary decision-maker; then loved ones who can speak for the patient; then doctors. These documents seldom mention judges. ... The American tradition reflects Catholic teaching.\" This conflicts with the statements issued in Rome by Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, and the two statements issued in London by the catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales but Doerflinger certainly reflects the American tradition. Both the Holy See and the United Kingdom are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The United States is a signatory but remains the only member state not to have ratified the convention. Its disinclination to do so is characterised in a U.S. Senate Resolution of 10 March 2011.\n\nWilkinson argued that the dominant legal approach in the US is unreasonable. \"It either assumes that parents are infallible and always make the best decisions for their child. Or it assumes that children are the property of their parents, who may make whatever decisions they like about them.\" Wilkinson also argued that the disagreement in this case between the doctors and the parents was unreasonable and argued that the doctors and the courts were right to have withheld the experimental treatment. Savulescu argued that the disagreement was reasonable and that the parents' decision should have prevailed.\n\nRaanan Gillon, Emeritus Professor of medical ethics at Imperial College London, President of the Institute of Medical Ethics, had argued similarly on the BBC radio Programme The Moral Maze on 12 July. Wilkinson also appeared on that programme, which was broadcast on the evening before the second evidential hearing at the High Court. Gillon said that the court was susceptible to ethical criticism and that in his opinion it had made the wrong decision. He argued that many children were being kept alive by artificial ventilation and that the accompanying pain and discomfort, which could be ameliorated, was not sufficient reason to override the parents right to decide. Wilkinson was more circumspect. He declined to say whether he thought the court had been right or wrong – he did not believe that he knew sufficient of the medical facts and he doubted that anyone other than those involved in the case did either. He drew on his regular working experience in a paediatric intensive care unit and stressed the need for doctors to listen to parents, to work to understand their views and to retain the trust of parents. Wilkinson stressed the continual worry that practitioners in his field had about the balance between the pain of treatment against its possible or potential benefits.  He stressed that ventilation and suction were painful intrusive procedures.\n\nThe majority of these opinions were promulgated before the second evidential hearing in the High Court or before the full judgement was published.\n\nBeneficence and non-maleficence \nSavulescu's view that the parents' disagreement with the doctors was reasonable was based in part on the argument that the prospect of benefit offered by the proposed experimental treatment, albeit small, offered more than death. In his opinion, the benefits outweighed any harm – modern medicine is such that the pain and suffering caused by the artificial ventilation and suction would be ameliorated. Professor Savulescu's views in this regard were in accord with Professor Gillon's. Both Savulescu and Wilkinson had earlier argued against the notion of a 'best interest' argument to support the withdrawal of artificial life support. \"Dominic Wilkinson and I have argued that although futility is often said to refer to 'best interests', it is more appropriately interpreted as a justice justification for limitation, that is, (the probability of the treatment prolonging life, or the quality of life, or the length of time the patient can survive are too low to justify the cost of the attempt (distributive justice)). ... The reason we have argued this is that the best interests justification [that continued life is no longer in the patient's interests] requires that doctors establish that life is no longer worth living. That is, that the person would be better off dead.\"\n\nWilkinson argues that the 'vanishingly small' possibility of benefit from the experimental treatment must be weighed against the \"significant negatives in the balance. Those negatives can arise from the child's illness, or from the medical treatment. ... Being kept alive in intensive care is not pleasant. Although we do our best to provide pain relief, sedation, care and comfort to gravely ill children and babies, that ability is finite and imperfect. Children on long-term ventilation often appear uncomfortable at least part of the time. They have frequent needles and invasive procedures. They may be distressed and unable to communicate the source of their distress. ... Sadly, reluctantly, doctors and judges do sometimes conclude and are justified in concluding that slim chances of life are not always better than dying. Providing comfort, avoiding painful and unhelpful medical treatments, supporting the child and family for their remaining time. Sometimes that is the best that we can do, and the only ethical course.\"\n\nJustice\n\nResources \nGillon, in the Moral Maze programme accepted the proposition that there could have been a resources argument against the use of the proposed experimental treatment but said that this was not a relevant issue in Charlie's case because the parents had raised sufficient funds to pay for the treatment. This was accepted by Wilkinson in the same programme. But Robert D. Truog, director, Harvard Center for Bioethics, Frances Glessner Lee Professor of Legal Medicine, Professor of Anaesthesia (Pediatrics) argued that the notion that Charlie's parents are paying is misleading. Tertiary care medical centres able to do research and provide care depend on communal investment made by society over decades. Society always has a financial stake in how communal services are used and has a legitimate claim in insisting that these resources be used wisely and for the benefit of all. \"No one can demand non-beneficial treatments simply by claiming that they are paying out-of-pocket.\" It has been argued that the case had a negative impact on distributive justice, as Great Ormond Street Hospital incurred legal costs of £205,000, including VAT (money diverted from medical care to lawyers), and that distributive justice could be harmed further if proposed reforms known as 'Charlie's Law' (which would replace the best interests test with a significant harm test) are enacted.\n\nLaw \nThe legal proceedings commenced in March, some two months after Charlie's treating doctors formed the view that artificial life support was inimical to his interests, and were concluded four months later. The 'No Delay' principle of the Children Act 1989 was in conflict with the duty of the courts to do justice by all the parties.  The parents had a right to contest the matter and to take it through the three appeal stages. When they later claimed to have new evidence GOSH was bound to return the matter to court. The delays were lamented repeatedly throughout the case. Lady Hale in the Supreme Court \"By granting a stay, even of short duration, we would in some sense be complicit in directing a course of action which is contrary to Charlie's best interests.\" Savulescu, \"This delay, if caused by the ethics process, would be another example of 'lethal ethics. It has been argued that Charlie's best interests would have been better served had the experimental treatment been administered at GOSH in January. Prof. Savulescu, in a paper entitled \"The Moral of the Case of Charlie Gard: Give Dying Patients Experimental Treatment ... Early\" Prof. Wilkinson later came to a similar view. \"In retrospect, it would have been better for Charlie to have received the requested treatment 6 months ago than to have a protracted legal dispute (with continued treatment in intensive care anyway).\" By 6 July, a few days before the second evidential hearing of the case, Prof. Wilkinson had aligned himself with Savulescu's utilitarian view. but his view remained that \"the doctors were right to oppose experimental treatment for Charlie in January, the judges were right to decline the family's request for treatment in April, and [that] it would be deeply ethically problematic to provide the treatment now\".  He cites two reasons for these views; \"Experimental treatment for Charlie Gard is associated with significant side effects such that it is highly likely not to be in his interests to provide it.\" and that \"in January [the Doctors] could not have predicted that 6 months and 4 court judgments later treatment would still be continuing\".\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Charlie's Fight, family website\n Smith-Squire, Alison (parents' media representative).

Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs.\n\nAt the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon, mixing clinical work and research. Woodruff principally studied transplant rejection and immunosuppression.  His work in these areas of transplantation biology led Woodruff to perform the first kidney transplant in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1969. Although retiring from surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organisations.\n\nEarly life \nMichael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England, the son of Harold Addison Woodruff and his wife, Margaret Ada Cooper. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a professor of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.\n\nThe remainder of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in Finchley. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a staphylococcal septicaemia. The two then spent a short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.\n\nIn 1919, Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first marriage. The two boys did their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's Pasteur Institute. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at Queen's College in Taunton, Somerset on the south coast of England. The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as \"colonials\" who were \"backward\" and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate. Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist Wesley College, where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing.\n\nHe won a government scholarship to the University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. He decided to take up medical studies at the end of his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.\n\nAfter graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal medicine for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Woodruff then started his surgical training.\n\nWorld War II \nAt the outbreak of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941. At that time, he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.\n\nAfter being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. In the camp, Woodruff realised that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, soya beans, rice polishings, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled \"Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps\". Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.\n\nWhile stationed at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical anæsthetics severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used hypnotism as the sole means of anæsthesia for a wide range of dental and surgical procedures.\n\nAt the conclusion of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives.\n\nEarly career \nSoon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no guarantee of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.\n\nSheffield \nAfter passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, he had planned to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.\n\nAberdeen \nIn 1948, shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne, Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the University of Aberdeen where he was given a post as a senior lecturer, having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand. At Aberdeen, Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson, and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services. He took advantage of this access and his wife's skills as a lab assistant to investigate in utero grafts (tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the womb). At the time, the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given in utero grafts, he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection. Woodruff's experiments with rats, however, produced negative results. Woodruff also commenced work on antilymphocyte serum for immunosuppression, with little initial success.\n\nWhile in Aberdeen, Woodruff also visited the United States on a World Health Organization (WHO) Travelling Fellowship. During the visit, he met many of the leading American surgeons, an experience that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff experimented with the effects of cortisone and the impact of blood antigen on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts. When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors. In 1951 Woodruff was awarded a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application.\n\nDunedin \n\nIn 1953, Woodruff moved to Dunedin New Zealand to become Professor of Surgery at the University of Otago. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London and St Andrews University in Scotland. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance to allografts in rats. This line of research proved unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in Dunedin, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in his four years in New Zealand, Dunedin's population of 100,000 was insufficient to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.\n\nEdinburgh \n\nIn 1957, Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council.\n\nThe research group's principal investigations concerned immunological tolerance (the body's acceptance of tissues, as opposed to rejection), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked with the use of immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.\n\nMost notably, he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. The donor kidney was harvested by James Ross and transplanted by Woodruff. Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.\n\nThe success of Woodruff's clinical transplant program was recognised and enhanced by funding from the Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.\n\nWoodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent the next ten years there, engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on tumor immunology using Corynebacterium parvum. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, travelling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001, a month before his 90th birthday.\n\nLegacy \nWoodruff's contributions to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised a method of implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's contributions to the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.\n\nThese important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. The next year, 1969, Woodruff was knighted by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organisations gave Woodruff honorary membership, including the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Woodruff also held office in several scientific organisations, serving as Vice-President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a visiting professor at a number of universities.\n\nDespite his profound influence on transplantation and what Peter Morris called \"a commanding presence in any gathering\", Woodruff was not known for his ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and had a tendency to mumble. Nevertheless, Morris said that Woodruff has \"a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour\". Morris concluded that \"What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous.\"\n\nPublications \nWoodruff's impact is also apparent in his large volume of publications. In addition to authoring over two hundred scholarly papers, Woodruff wrote eight books during his career, covering numerous aspects of medicine and surgery.\n Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps.

Their first son completed a civil engineering degree at Sheffield University, where the daughter also attended, completing a science degree in botany. The second son did a medical degree at University College London and became an ophthalmologist. Woodruff and his wife were avid tennis players and had a court in their home in Edinburgh. After moving to Edinburgh, Woodruff took up sailing with the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and went on to compete in some races. He owned a boat and was known to go sailing on it in the Mediterranean each summer with his wife. During his student years, Woodruff was a keen rower and field hockey player.\n\nWoodruff was a lover of classical music, and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E. Floyd, the organist of St Paul's Cathedral, he became the college organist at Queen’s College in Melbourne; he later learned to play the piano. In his spare time, Woodruff continued to pursue his love of pure mathematics, especially number theory. He periodically attempted to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, but failed.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Sir Michael Woodruff, The Guardian\n \n MacDonald H (October 2015).

Lina Wertmüller was nominated as best director at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The plot concerns a romantic and heart-breaking relationship between a chauvinist Italian journalist and a feminist American photographer. The film was shot in San Francisco and Rome and was the director's first film with original dialogue in the English language.\n\n directed by Lina Wertmüller and stars Paolo Villaggio.

Barilli admitted to needing the money and took the offer to direct the film. Filming started in Manziana in August 1977. Barilli and producer Tommaso Dazzi often argued on set as Barilli shot scenes that were not in the script, which Barilli did not care for as he wanted to shoot the film the way he wanted to.

Club considered the song to be a highlight of the album, writing it \"is a heart-poundingly wicked, electronics-driven stunner.\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani felt that \"never has the impetus to suicide been captured more thoughtfully or beautifully, at least in song.\" Peter Buckley thought the song was a stand-out track and that it \"[emphasizes] her skills as composer, singer and producer.\" In the Homogenic review for Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1990s, Dominique Leone of wrote that only in \"Pluto\", Björk \"[steps] out from her cocoon in a fit of rage, although even then an air of intrigue envelops the track.\"\n\n  Written and produced by Björk and Mark Bell, the four-on-the-floor \"Pluto\" has been described as the \"most techno-sounding composition from the album\" and \"Homogenic's most savage song.\" The track has also been described as \"industrial-edged\" by Billboard, and James Hunter of Spin wrote \"only with [...] the industrial \"Pluto\" does she concentrate on genre.\" Dominique Leone of Pitchfork Media dubbed the song \"experimental house.\" The track has also been identified as IDM. Björk sings in \"primitive-sounding screams,\" accentuated by a sampled, digitized beat that creates the perception that her voice is \"natural\" and \"is being manipulated by something completely technological.\" Although her voice and the beats give the song its hard techno sound, their methodical rhythm \"also evoke chantlike characteristics.\" David Browne \n\n \"All Is Full of Love\", stands for that new beginning, \"like the birds coming out after a thunderstorm,\" whereas \"Pluto\" stands for death. The singer has also described \"Pluto\" as about \"being plastered, that need to destroy everything so you can start again\". Lyrically, it has been described as \"sparse.\" Björk sings: \"Excuse me/But I just have to/Explode/Explode this body/Off me/I'll be brand new/Brand new tomorrow/A little bit tired/But brand new.\" Some critics considered the lyrics to be about the contemplation of suicide. Discussing the track, Sheila Whiteley wrote: \"as anyone who has been through personal trauma knows only too well, rejuvenation often involves a nightmare journey.\" Björk's official website also stated that the song is \"about the liberation of hedonism.\"\n\n \"Pluto\" is a song by Icelandic musician Björk. The song was written and produced by Björk and British producer Mark Bell for Björk's third studio album, Homogenic (1997).\n\n things, just really thinking heavy metal. Most of the tracks I wrote before Mark started on them, so they're more like song-songs, and then Mark would work on beats and arrangements with me afterwards.\" The song's title comes from the astrological concepts of Pluto, the sign ruler of Scorpio. Pluto is sometimes called \"the Great Renewer\": it is the planet of rebirth and transformation that comes from experiences of destruction. A Scorpio herself, Björk has said: \"having a lot in the planet Pluto, which I do, means you want to cut the crap, throw all the rubbish away. No extra baggage. It's death and birth.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Pluto (Song)?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the United Kingdom, she held the title of Princess with the style Her Highness as a male-line great-granddaughter of King George III. She was known as \"Lily\" within her family. In January 1866, the Prime Minister of Prussia Otto von Bismarck began negotiations with Hanover, represented by Count Platen-Hallermund, regarding the possible marriage of Frederica to Prince Albrecht of Prussia. These plans came to nothing as tensions grew between Hanover and Prussia finally resulting in the Austro-Prussian War (14 June – 23 August 1866). In 1866, Frederica's father was deposed as King of Hanover. Eventually, the family settled at Gmunden in Austria, where they owned Schloss Cumberland (named for the British Ducal title held by Frederica's father).

It was determined he had died three days earlier, on April 5. The Seattle Police Department incident report stated that Cobain was found with a shotgun across his body, had suffered a visible gunshot wound to the head, and that a suicide note had been discovered nearby. It was confirmed that Cobain had committed suicide. Conspiracy theories that Cobain was murdered have spread.\n\nBackground \n\nKurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the American grunge rock band Nirvana, one of the most influential acts of the 1990s and one of the best-selling bands of all time. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. He was also prone to alcoholism, suffered from depression, and regularly used drugs and inhalants. Cobain had two uncles who killed themselves using guns.\n\nOn March 3, 1994, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome following an overdose of painkillers. His management agency, Gold Mountain Records, said that the overdose was accidental, and that he was suffering from influenza and fatigue. However, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, later said the overdose had been a suicide attempt: \"He took 50 pills. He probably forgot how many he took. But there was a definite suicidal urge, to be gobbling and gobbling and gobbling.\" Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, said that the family had a history of suicide, and that Cobain had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.\n\nCobain said that his stomach pain had been so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal, and that taking heroin was \"the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now\". In Charles Cross's biography Heavier Than Heaven, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his intervention: \"He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody.\" Novoselic's offer to buy dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: \"His dealer was right there. He wanted to get fucked up into oblivion ... He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do.\"\n\nDeath \nOn March 31, 1994, Cobain left the rehabilitation center he had checked into the day before, Exodus Recovery Center, by scaling a six-foot wall. On April 2, Cobain took a taxi to a Seattle gun shop, where he received a receipt for firearm shells. Cobain told the taxi driver he wanted to buy shells because he had been burglarized.\n\nOn April 8, Cobain's body was discovered in the greenhouse above the garage at his Lake Washington Boulevard East house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith, who arrived that morning to install security lighting. Smith thought Cobain was asleep until he saw blood oozing from his ear. He also found a suicide note with a pen stuck through it inside a flower pot. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. It had been legally purchased by Carlson at Stan Baker's Gun Shop in Seattle. Although conductor David Woodard had built a Dreamachine for Cobain, rumors that Cobain had been using the device heavily in the days leading up to his suicide were contradicted by later reports.\n\nCobain did not want the gun purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it for his own protection. The police had taken away his guns twice in the previous ten months. The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbows. The shotgun was not checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint Analysis Report, four latent prints were lifted, but they were not usable. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel.\n\nOn April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was evidence of Valium in his blood. The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug.\n\nIn March 2014, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault. According to Seattle police, the photographs depict the scene of Cobain's corpse more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a cold case investigator, was asked to look at the film because \"it is 20 years later and it's a high media case\". Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remained suicide and that the images would not be released to the public; however the images were released in 2016. According to a police spokesperson, the SPD receives at least one request weekly, mostly through Twitter, to reopen the investigation. This resulted in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.\n\nMemorial and cremation \nOn April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived, and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house.\n\nCobain's body was cremated. Love divided his ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. She took another portion of his ashes to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures. A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse\".\n\nReactions from Cobain's friends \nSeveral of Cobain's friends were surprised by his suicide. Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain, told Rolling Stone: \"I never knew Cobain to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\" In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\".\n\nAnthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" Kurt's death was unexpected ... It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming and all of his darkness, he was just lovable.\n\nThe song \"Tearjerker\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain.\n\nA musical hero of Cobain's, Greg Sage, said in an interview: Well, I can't really speculate other than what he said to me, which was, he wasn't at all happy about it, success to him seemed like, I think, a brick wall. There was nowhere else to go but down, it was too artificial for him, and he wasn't an artificial person at all. He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers. It was kind of in secret, because, I mean, people would definitely not allow him to do that. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.\n\nAlternative theories\n\nRichard Lee \nThe first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle public access host Richard Lee. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called Kurt Cobain Was Murdered, saying there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Several pathology experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head.\n\nTom Grant \nTom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, said he believes that Cobain was murdered. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, and films, including the 2015 docudrama Soaked in Bleach. Grant was still under Love's employment when Cobain's body was found. Grant has stated that he finds the events surrounding Cobain's death to be \"filled with lies, contradictions in logic, and countless inconsistencies. Motivated by profit over truth as well as a web of business deals and personal career considerations, Courtney Love, her lawyers, and many of Courtney's industry supporters have engaged in an effort to keep the public from learning the real facts of this case.\" \n\nThere are several components to Grant's theory, including the assertion that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a large dose of heroin and still have been able to pull the trigger, the belief that Cobain's note was doctored to make it only appear to be a suicide note, and a purported lack of fingerprints from Cobain or others at the scene. He also asserts that Love had financial motivation to kill Cobain, both in the form of rumors that Cobain was planning to divorce her, and the fact that Cobain had turned down an offer to headline the 1994 Lollapalooza festival for nearly $10 million.\n\nIn studying the Rome incident, journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt. \"We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me,\" said Galletta, who also contradicted Love's claim that 50 Rohypnol pills were removed from Cobain's stomach. Halperin and Wallace mused, \"Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?\"\n\nGrant believes the claim that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. Prior to the shooting, some close to Cobain, notably Gold Mountain Records, firmly denied he had wanted to die. Grant believes that if that were true, Cobain's friends and family would have been told in order that they could keep a close watch on him. However, others assert that these denials were simply self-serving, in an effort to mask what was really going on behind the scenes. Lee Ranaldo, guitarist for Sonic Youth, told Rolling Stone, \"Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world.\"\n\nGrant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation. Grant stated: \"I wrestled with that ... but if I go broke, I'll have to give up my pursuit and Courtney wins.\" Sergeant Donald Cameron, one of the homicide detectives involved in the case, dismissed Grant's theory outright, saying, \"[Grant] hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide,\" while Seattle homicide detective Mike Ciesynski, who reviewed the case, was quoted as saying of Grant, \"An experienced Det. would never have come up with the theories that he's come up with.\" Grant in turn has accused Cameron of being a personal friend of Courtney Love. Dylan Carlson told Halperin and Wallace that he also did not believe that Grant's theory was valid, and in an interview with Broomfield implied that if he believed that his friend was murdered, he would have dealt with it himself.\n\nNick Broomfield \nFilmmaker Nick Broomfield, deciding to investigate the theories himself, brought a film crew to visit a number of people associated with both Cobain and Love, including Love's estranged father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couples' former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to The Mentors' bandleader Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke, who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed that he knew who killed Cobain, he did not mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called \"Allen\" or \"Alain\", before quickly interjecting, \"I mean, my friend\", then laughing, \"I'll let the FBI catch him.\" According to Mentors' bass player Steve Broy, the whole story was concocted to sell supermarket tabloids. Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.\n\nBroomfield titled the finished documentary Kurt & Courtney, which was released on February 27, 1998. In the end, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, he summed up his thoughts: \"I think that he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.\"\n\nIan Halperin and Max Wallace \nJournalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace followed a similar path and attempted to investigate the murder theory themselves. Based on evidence gathered in interviews, Halperin and Wallace believed that Cobain wanted to divorce Love near the time of his death, and that she was looking for \"a vicious divorce lawyer\" to help crush a prenuptial agreement she'd reportedly signed that would keep their respective fortunes separate in the event of divorce. They also made the case that because Nikolas Hartshorne (the coroner in Cobain's case) was an admitted friend of Love's, that this was a conflict of interest. Their initial book, Who Killed Kurt Cobain?, was released in 1999, and drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively prove foul play, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was working for Love. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain.\n\nFriends and family \nSeveral of Cobain's friends and family members also believe Cobain was murdered.  Hank Harrison, Courtney Love's father, has shared his belief that Love had a motive, there is evidence of foul play, and the case should be re-opened. Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain, also publicly stated that he believed Cobain was murdered.\n\nIn August 2005, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon was asked about Cobain's death in an interview for Uncut Magazine. When asked what she thought to be Cobain's motive for suicide, Gordon replied: \"I don't even know that he killed himself. There are people close to him who don't think that he did ...\" When asked if she thought someone else had killed him, Gordon answered, \"I do, yes.\" In the same interview, Gordon's then-husband and collaborator Thurston Moore stated: Kurt died in a very harsh way. It wasn't just an OD. He actually killed himself violently. It was so aggressive, and he wasn't an aggressive person, he was a smart person, he had an interesting intellect. So it kind of made sense because it was like: wow, what a fucking gesture. But at the same time it was like: something's wrong with that gesture. It doesn't really lie with what we know.\nHowever, in 2015, in a piece she wrote for The Guardian, Gordon said that she had not been surprised to hear of Cobain's suicide, stating, \"I’ll always remember the day Thurston called to tell me Kurt had shot himself. Of course I was totally shocked, but I wasn’t entirely surprised. There had been an incident in Rome, where Kurt had OD’d, but the details were never clear.\"\n\nOthers, however, have dismissed or ignored the conspiracy theories surrounding Cobain's death. In an interview with The Independent, former Nirvana manager and friend of Cobain, Danny Goldberg, emphasized Cobain's erratic and depressed behavior in the days and weeks leading up to his death, stating, It’s ridiculous. He killed himself. I saw him the week beforehand, he was depressed. He tried to kill himself six weeks earlier, he’d talked and written about suicide a lot, he was on drugs, he got a gun. Why do people speculate about it? The tragedy of the loss is so great people look for other explanations. I don’t think there’s any truth at all to it.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Maxim Furek (2008). The Death Proclamation of Generation X: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of Goth, Grunge and Heroin, \"Kurt Donald Cobain\", pp. 20–38. i-Universe. \n\n1994 in music\n1994 in American music\n1994 in Seattle\nApril 1994 events in the United States\nCobain, Kurt\nCobain, Kurt\nKurt Cobain\nCobain, Kurt\n1994 suicides\n\nes:Kurt Cobain#Semanas finales y muerte\n\nOn April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and guitarist of the American rock band Nirvana, was found dead at his home in Seattle, Washington. It was determined he had died three days earlier, on April 5. The Seattle Police Department incident report stated that Cobain was found with a shotgun across his body, had suffered a visible gunshot wound to the head, and that a suicide note had been discovered nearby. It was confirmed that Cobain had committed suicide. Conspiracy theories that Cobain was murdered have spread.\n\nBackground \n\nKurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the American grunge rock band Nirvana, one of the most influential acts of the 1990s and one of the best-selling bands of all time. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. He was also prone to alcoholism, suffered from depression, and regularly used drugs and inhalants. Cobain had two uncles who killed themselves using guns.\n\nOn March 3, 1994, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome following an overdose of painkillers. His management agency, Gold Mountain Records, said that the overdose was accidental, and that he was suffering from influenza and fatigue. However, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, later said the overdose had been a suicide attempt: \"He took 50 pills. He probably forgot how many he took. But there was a definite suicidal urge, to be gobbling and gobbling and gobbling.\" Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, said that the family had a history of suicide, and that Cobain had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.\n\nCobain said that his stomach pain had been so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal, and that taking heroin was \"the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now\". In Charles Cross's biography Heavier Than Heaven, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his intervention: \"He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody.\" Novoselic's offer to buy dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: \"His dealer was right there. He wanted to get fucked up into oblivion ... He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do.\"\n\nDeath \nOn March 31, 1994, Cobain left the rehabilitation center he had checked into the day before, Exodus Recovery Center, by scaling a six-foot wall. On April 2, Cobain took a taxi to a Seattle gun shop, where he received a receipt for firearm shells. Cobain told the taxi driver he wanted to buy shells because he had been burglarized.\n\nOn April 8, Cobain's body was discovered in the greenhouse above the garage at his Lake Washington Boulevard East house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith, who arrived that morning to install security lighting. Smith thought Cobain was asleep until he saw blood oozing from his ear. He also found a suicide note with a pen stuck through it inside a flower pot. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend, musician Dylan Carlson, was found on Cobain's chest. It had been legally purchased by Carlson at Stan Baker's Gun Shop in Seattle. Although conductor David Woodard had built a Dreamachine for Cobain, rumors that Cobain had been using the device heavily in the days leading up to his suicide were contradicted by later reports.\n\nCobain did not want the gun purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it for his own protection. The police had taken away his guns twice in the previous ten months. The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbows. The shotgun was not checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint Analysis Report, four latent prints were lifted, but they were not usable. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel.\n\nOn April 14, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was evidence of Valium in his blood. The report contained a quote from Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug.\n\nIn March 2014, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault. According to Seattle police, the photographs depict the scene of Cobain's corpse more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a cold case investigator, was asked to look at the film because \"it is 20 years later and it's a high media case\". Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remained suicide and that the images would not be released to the public; however the images were released in 2016. According to a police spokesperson, the SPD receives at least one request weekly, mostly through Twitter, to reopen the investigation. This resulted in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.\n\nMemorial and cremation \nOn April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived, and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained. In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house.\n\nCobain's body was cremated. Love divided his ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. She took another portion of his ashes to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures. A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse\".\n\nReactions from Cobain's friends \nSeveral of Cobain's friends were surprised by his suicide. Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain, told Rolling Stone: \"I never knew Cobain to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\" In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts him every day\".\n\nAnthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" Kurt's death was unexpected ... It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming and all of his darkness, he was just lovable.\n\nThe song \"Tearjerker\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain.\n\nA musical hero of Cobain's, Greg Sage, said in an interview: Well, I can't really speculate other than what he said to me, which was, he wasn't at all happy about it, success to him seemed like, I think, a brick wall. There was nowhere else to go but down, it was too artificial for him, and he wasn't an artificial person at all. He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers. It was kind of in secret, because, I mean, people would definitely not allow him to do that. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.\n\nAlternative theories\n\nRichard Lee \nThe first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle public access host Richard Lee. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called Kurt Cobain Was Murdered, saying there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Several pathology experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head.\n\nTom Grant \nTom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, said he believes that Cobain was murdered. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, and films, including the 2015 docudrama Soaked in Bleach. Grant was still under Love's employment when Cobain's body was found. Grant has stated that he finds the events surrounding Cobain's death to be \"filled with lies, contradictions in logic, and countless inconsistencies. Motivated by profit over truth as well as a web of business deals and personal career considerations, Courtney Love, her lawyers, and many of Courtney's industry supporters have engaged in an effort to keep the public from learning the real facts of this case.\" \n\nThere are several components to Grant's theory, including the assertion that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a large dose of heroin and still have been able to pull the trigger, the belief that Cobain's note was doctored to make it only appear to be a suicide note, and a purported lack of fingerprints from Cobain or others at the scene. He also asserts that Love had financial motivation to kill Cobain, both in the form of rumors that Cobain was planning to divorce her, and the fact that Cobain had turned down an offer to headline the 1994 Lollapalooza festival for nearly $10 million.\n\nIn studying the Rome incident, journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt. \"We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me,\" said Galletta, who also contradicted Love's claim that 50 Rohypnol pills were removed from Cobain's stomach. Halperin and Wallace mused, \"Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?\"\n\nGrant believes the claim that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. Prior to the shooting, some close to Cobain, notably Gold Mountain Records, firmly denied he had wanted to die. Grant believes that if that were true, Cobain's friends and family would have been told in order that they could keep a close watch on him. However, others assert that these denials were simply self-serving, in an effort to mask what was really going on behind the scenes. Lee Ranaldo, guitarist for Sonic Youth, told Rolling Stone, \"Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world.\"\n\nGrant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation. Grant stated: \"I wrestled with that ... but if I go broke, I'll have to give up my pursuit and Courtney wins.\" Sergeant Donald Cameron, one of the homicide detectives involved in the case, dismissed Grant's theory outright, saying, \"[Grant] hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide,\" while Seattle homicide detective Mike Ciesynski, who reviewed the case, was quoted as saying of Grant, \"An experienced Det. would never have come up with the theories that he's come up with.\" Grant in turn has accused Cameron of being a personal friend of Courtney Love.

However, he mentioned speaking to someone called \"Allen\" or \"Alain\", before quickly interjecting, \"I mean, my friend\", then laughing, \"I'll let the FBI catch him.\" According to Mentors' bass player Steve Broy, the whole story was concocted to sell supermarket tabloids. Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.\n\nBroomfield titled the finished documentary Kurt & Courtney, which was released on February 27, 1998. In the end, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, he summed up his thoughts: \"I think that he committed suicide.

Anwar al-Sadat didn't want to upset the Egyptian people, some of whom still loved and respected Nasser. The films deals frankly with the issue of drug addiction, as well as the decadence that obtained during the late Nasser era. The film was produced in 1971, and was unsuccessful financially, as it was frequently banned in the Middle East and also in the West (mainly Europe). It only gained acclaim thirty-five years later. It is still banned in many countries, especially in the Arab world. The film is now distributed by Founoon and is subtitled in French and English.\n\n Cairo Drive is a 2014 Egyptian documentary film by Sherief Elkatsha.

Instead, from my adopted home in England, I watched the revolution and the ensuing 26 years unfold on TV.” Over the years he came to feel that “what I was watching were developments in my homeland interpreted through the prism of mainly Western journalists and filmmakers.

He ended up writing, producing, directing, and photographing a 2004 documentary, Red Lines and Deadlines, about the staff of the newspaper and its reformist politics. It was first aired on PBS as part of the series Wide Angle.

When he shows the place to potential tenants, he must constantly shoo the old folks into the kitchen to hide. It’s Amaral’s charisma that imbues what could have been a cruel moment with endearing warmth and sensitivity. Hendler knows the habits and quirks of actors inside out, of course, and brings that authenticity to his story of a man in the process of becoming a performer. A witty and inspiring film about the revelation of embracing one’s creativity, Norberto's Deadline also explores the complications of aspiring to achieve international success in a small country with few resources. Against those very same odds, Hendler has achieved just that. Diana Sanchez\n\n Breslin was married twice. His first marriage, to Rosemary Dattolico, ended with her death in 1981.

His death left William I as the only Count of Nevers and William II as his heir apparent. On 20 June 1098, his grandfather died and William II succeeded to the County of Nevers. (William II should not be confused with his paternal uncle William of Nevers, Count of Tonnere). He took part in the Crusade of 1101. He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He arrived in Antioch with only a handful of knights. He persuaded Louis VI to break peace with Henry I and throw his support behind William Clito in 1115. He was imprisoned shortly afterwards by Theobald, Count of Blois. He participated in the Council of Troyes which opened on 14 January 1129 and is known for his support of the Second Crusade. He is believed to have been buried in Chartreuse, where Bernard of Clairvaux attempted and failed to resurrect him.\n\nFrancis II, Duke of Nevers (1540–1562), 2nd Duke; married Anne de Bourbon, daughter of Louis, Duke of Montpensier, no issue. ; Henriette of Cleves (1542–1601); married Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers, and became 4th Duchess of Nevers after the death of her brothers. ; James, Duke of Nevers (1544–1564), 3rd Duke, married Diane de la Marck ; Catherine of Cleves (1548–1633); married Antoine III of Croy and Henry I, Duke of Guise. ; Marie of Cleves (1553–1574); married Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé.

The only son of Charles II of Nevers (died in the Louvre in 1521) and Marie d'Albret, Countess of Rethel, Francis succeeded his father as Count of Nevers and Eu. In 1539, he became Duke of Nevers. When his mother died in 1549, he also inherited the title of Count of Rethel.

The trains, each traveling approximately 35-miles-an-hour, collided at the rail location nicknamed \"Alley Popper\". Fielding, not missing an opportunity for free publicity, scheduled the crash to coincide with a \"mammoth Labor Day picnic\" held outside Philipsburg and attended by an estimated crowd of 10,000 spectators.

The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. Its title refers to the surrealist game, Cadavre Exquis, invented by André Breton, in which the participants draw consecutive sections of a figure without seeing what the previous person has drawn, leading to unpredictable results, and is meant to describe the meandering nature of the film with its unpredictable foray into the world of political manipulations, as well as the (\"illustrous\") corpses of the murdered judges. In 2008, the film was selected to enter the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved.\n\n Sabrina Siani (born Sabrina Seggiani in Rome, 1963) is an Italian film actress. She also used pseudonyms such as Sabrina Sellers and Sabrina Syan. She starred in numerous films, mostly violent cannibal films and sexy barbarian \"sword-and-sandal\" movies, and most of her films were made in a three-year period between the ages of 17 and 20. Siani retired from acting in 1989, at age 26. Her brief career included working with some of the most famous Italian horror film directors of the time, including Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, Antonio Margheriti, Joe D'Amato, Jesús Franco and Alfonso Brescia.\n\n Born in Rome, Paola Senatore worked in Italian genre films during the 1970s, including poliziotteschi, commedia sexy all'italiana and giallo films. These included cult films such as Ricco the Mean Machine (1973), The Flower with the Petals of Steel (1973), The Killer Reserved Nine Seats (1974), Salon Kitty (1976), Emanuelle in America (1977), and Umberto Lenzi's cannibal film Eaten Alive! (1980). In the mid-1980s, after two soft-core erotic films directed by Joe D'Amato and because of drug problems and pregnancy, she accepted starring in pornographic magazines and in a hard-core film, Non stop... sempre buio in sala. Her film career ended in September 1985 when she was arrested for possession and trafficking of drugs.\n\n Il paese del sesso selvaggio (English: The Country of Savage Sex), also known as Man From Deep River, Deep River Savages and Sacrifice!, is a 1972 Italian cannibal exploitation film directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Ivan Rassimov, Me Me Lai and Pratitsak Singhara. It is perhaps best known for starting the \"cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is theorized that Lenzi was trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable popularity in Grindhouse theaters since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara had made Mondo Cane in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like Man from Deep River, Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film and its title were mainly inspired by A Man Called Horse, which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive.\n\n Ultimo mondo cannibale (English: Last Cannibal World; also known as Cannibal, Jungle Holocaust and The Last Survivor) is a 1977 Italian cannibal exploitation film directed by Ruggero Deodato. The film stars Massimo Foschi, Me Me Lai and Ivan Rassimov. The screenplay was written by Tito Carpi, Gianfranco Clerici and Renzo Genta, and tells the story of a man trying to escape from a jungle island inhabited by a native cannibal tribe. It is the precursor to Deodato's notoriously controversial Cannibal Holocaust (1980), but was originally slated to be directed by Umberto Lenzi as a follow-up to his prototypical 1972 cannibal film Man from Deep River. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died later, Emanuelle And The Last Cannibals or Hostile Country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His only top-40 hit was a cover of Steve Goodman's \"City of New Orleans\". His song \"Massachusetts\" was named the official folk song of the state, in which he has lived most of his adult life.

The Norwegian Viking Olaf Haraldson spent several years in England supporting Æthelred the Unready against the Danish King Cnut. While in England Olaf was in contact with many Christians who seemed to have influenced him into converting to Christianity. Olaf was baptised at Notre-Dame, Rouen in 1012. When Olaf returned to Norway, with the intention of restoring power to his family, he took a group of English priests and advisors with him. One of his principle advisors was Grimketel. Olaf became King of Norway and Grimketel became the Bishop of Nidaros. Olaf and Grimketel proclaimed the earliest Norwegian church laws \n\n  Having succeeded his father, the chronicle reveals that Haraldr Óláfsson was soon ousted from power by representatives of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. After unsuccessfully repulsing these men, Haraldr Óláfsson voyaged to Norway, where he stayed for about three years, and thus reconciled himself with Hákon, who in turn reinstalled him as king in the Isles. In 1247, the thirteenth-century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar states that Haraldr Óláfsson again journeyed to Norway, where he married Hákon's daughter, Cecilía, in the winter of 1247/1248. On the newly-weds' return voyage in the autumn of 1248, the chronicle and saga report that their ship foundered \n\n  Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was one of several sons of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of Mann and the Isles, and thus a member of the Crovan dynasty. Although Óláfr is known to have had two wives, and no contemporaneous source names the mother of his children, there is evidence suggesting that their mother may have been Óláfr's second wife: Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt, Earl of Ross. Specifically, the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann states that, when Óláfr died in 1237, he was succeeded by his fourteen-year-old son, Haraldr Óláfsson. This source therefore dates Haraldr Óláfsson's birth to 1223, about the time when Óláfr and Fearchar allied themselves in marriage. The ancestral origins of Fearchar's family are \n\n Olaf II Haraldsson (c. 995 – 29 July 1030), later known as Saint Olaf (and traditionally as St. Olave), was King of Norway from 1015 to 1028. Son of Harald Grenske, a petty king in Vestfold, Norway, he was posthumously given the title Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae (Eternal/Perpetual King of Norway) and canonised at Nidaros (Trondheim) by Bishop Grimkell, one year after his death in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030. His remains were enshrined in Nidaros Cathedral, built over his burial site. His sainthood encouraged the widespread adoption of Christianity by Scandinavia's Vikings/Norsemen. Pope Alexander III confirmed Olaf's local canonisation in 1164, making him a universally recognised saint of the Roman Catholic Church and started to be known as Rex Perpetuus \n\n Harald was born in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or possibly 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald was the youngest of King Olaf II of Norway / Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.

Filmed at Riverside Film Studios in London, the picture was one of several second feature thrillers made in partnership by Saunders and Coen. Restricted by a meagre budget and minor distributors in Archway, production of The Golden Link still stood out for its rich cast and cinematography by Harry Waxman. The film was generally well received after its release on 24 August 1954.

Stravinsky, never one to let work go to waste, refashioned his unused score into \"Four Norwegian Moods,\" and Gruenberg was nominated for another Oscar. His next film job, An American Romance, was a heart-breaking failure for its director, King Vidor, a $3 million Technicolor tale of a steel industrialist that nobody saw; an uncredited composer was brought in to patch up the half-hour that was lopped out of it after its first screenings, before it lost a million dollars. It ended director King Vidor's long career at MGM.\n\n Walter Heurtley Braithwaite (1906–1991) was a composer, pianist and teacher.

He later worked on Went the Day Well?, Next of Kin, The First of the Few (1942) and Henry V (1944). He generally orchestrated the shorter sections of Walton's film scores, based on Walton's jottings on 2 or 3 staves, and according to specific instructions or in Walton's style. Walton was commissioned to write the score for The Bells Go Down, but declined and instead offered it to Roy Douglas to write his own music. Douglas and Ernest Irving helped Walton complete the ballet The Quest by his birthday, 29 March 1943, in time for its premiere performance only a week later. Walton arranged the Valse from Facade for piano, but all other piano arrangements from the score were made by others, including Douglas, Constant Lambert, Herbert Murrill and Mátyás Seiber. Douglas worked with Walton on the revised version of Belshazzar's Feast, but regretted Walton's decision to use less percussion than in the original. The vocal score of Troilus and Cressida was largely the work of Roy Douglas, assisted by Franz Reizenstein in Act III.\n\n Henry Nicola Mancini (born Enrico Nicola Mancini; April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994) was an American composer, conductor, arranger, pianist and flautist.

The film stars an international ensemble, with American actor John Malkovich, Taiwanese actress Shuya Chang, and Chilean actor Marko Zaror. 100 Years is apparently a short film. Rodriguez stated in a 2019 interview: \"I was making several short films for them, and I finished that one first, we shot that one first, I thought that was gonna be a commercial or something. And then I showed them the movie and they said 'Yeah, that's great, that's great. That's the one we lock away.' And I said 'What? That's the one you lock away? What about the other one with the future--' 'No, that's the commercial.' [...] The one that I was most attached to was the one they locked away.\"\n\nA brilliant young filmmaker named Jonathan Heap made a superb 30-minute version of my short story \"12:01 PM\". It was an Oscar nominee in 1990, and was later adapted (very loosely) into a two-hour Fox movie called 12:01. The story was also adapted&mdash;actually plagiarized&mdash;into a major theatrical film in 1993. Jonathan Heap and I were outraged and tried very hard to go after the rascals who had robbed us, but alas, the Hollywood establishment closed ranks. We were no Art Buchwald.

Van den Broecke was a varied sculptor who worked in many materials including alabaster, marble, sandstone, wax and terracotta. His subject matter ranged from religious to mythological representations and portraits. He created large-scale works such as retables, partitions and fireplaces. He was particularly known in Antwerp for his small images, jewelry for cabinets of curiosities and the sculpted decorations of facades. Van den Broecke's surviving works in his home country are relatively few. There are busts of and Albrecht Dürer that he made for the \n\n Self in Manhattan.

His political stance was broad and nuanced with homoerotic imagery. He died of AIDS on April 21, 2002, aged 48.

He is known for such sculptures as The Thinker, Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell. Many of Rodin's most notable sculptures were criticized, as they clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modeled the human body with naturalism, and his sculptures celebrate individual character and physicality. Although Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, he refused to change his style, and his continued output brought increasing favor from \n\n Gordon Herickx (1900–1953) was an English sculptor.

Vincent Canby from The New York Times lauded the single and album tracks \"Come Back to Me\", \"Go to Sleep\", and \"What Did I Have That I Don't Have\" for being the soundtrack's four best songs. Although AllMusic's William Ruhlmann was critical of the majority of On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, he complimented Streisand's vocal performance on the title track. The staff at Billboard complimented Streisand's performance on \"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\". They wrote that because of its strength, and the strengths of soundtrack songs \"He Isn't You\" and \"What Did I Have That I Don't Have\", the album will likely become a commercial success and is worth purchasing.\n\n \"On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)\" is a song written by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics) for the 1965 musical On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.

The film is based on the life of Evan Perry, who experienced bipolar depression from a young age. The documentary was filmed throughout Evan's life, because whenever his parents, Dana and Hart Perry, consulted a psychiatrist about Evan's suicidal comments or other signs of mental illness, the psychiatrists did not believe that their son was depressed.  The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed.\n\nEvan was diagnosed with depression at age 5, and he was later diagnosed with bipolar depression. Despite the treatment and medication received, he ended up killing himself in 2005 at age 15. Evan Perry had a family medical history involving serious mental illnesses. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him.\n\nAbout four years after Evan's death, the documentary was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and released on television and DVD.\n\nStory\n\nEarly childhood \nEvan was very loving towards his family and others. At school, he was always the model student, behaving very well and being helpful.  When he was four years old, he started telling his mom that he wanted to kill himself. It shocked her because at that age, she thought kids would not even know what death is, and he did not seem sad when he was talking about dying.  In kindergarten, Evan said he wanted to kill himself in front of the whole class.  The teacher told his parents, and Hart and Dana Perry took him to see a therapist.\n\nIn 1995, mental health professionals were uncertain whether young children could be depressed. Dana Perry, a professional filmmaker, knew that psychiatrists would not believe everything she told them about her son. At this point, she decided to film as much as she could from Evan's life, especially when he talked about suicide.\n\nAt age 5, Evan Perry was diagnosed with depression, and he was prescribed Prozac. The medication did not seem to be working, but it was their only choice, so they decided to give it time. Evan was very much into filming, just like his parents. At home he would make skits with his brothers and film vacations, and at school he would make plays. Most of his plays were about death.\n\nBy the time Evan was 7 years old, he started behaving like a teenager. His responses were really short towards his family, he was listening to Nirvana, he was writing songs about suicide, demons, and pain, and he would lock himself in his room away from everyone. His parents knew this behavior wasn't normal at this age, and they were concerned, but there wasn't much they could do.\n\nMiddle childhood \nWhen Evan was 10 years old he started attending Pk Yonge School and made his first attempt to commit suicide. He was at school and he sneaked off to the roof while everyone was at the playground below. He was standing on the ledge very calmly and one of his teachers was able to get him down from the roof while his parents got there. When his parents picked him up, they went straight to the Four Winds which is a mental institution. There they diagnosed him with Bipolar depression. His whole stay there, Evan kept saying that he simply did it for attention, however they knew it was just his way of getting the attention off of him. Evan was prescribed a dosage of lithium to help with the chemical imbalance in his brain. When Evan was stable enough to leave the institution, his parents sent him to Wellspring which is a home for troubled kids like Evan. At Wellspring he ran away his first night, but eventually he gave in and let himself get help. Evan became a boy again, he was no longer behaving like a broody teenager, he was playing games outside like every other kid would do. His family also went to Wellspring for family therapy, so that they could all learn to communicate and understand Evan. He seemed to be getting better, he seemed healthier and happier so he was taken out of Wellspring and was sent to York prep school.\n\nAdolescence \nAt this school Evan became very involved, he made many friends and he would go out and have fun. Evan also got back into filming and he would make productions with his friends. None of his friends could tell that Evan had bipolar depression, the only time they noticed something off was closer to the time when he committed suicide. Many years passed and Evan was doing great at his school, his social life was great and he was very close to his family. When Evan was 15 he asked to be taken off the Lithium, his parents thought it could work if he gradually came off the medication. Little by little they reduced his dosage with the approval of his therapist, at first he seemed to be doing okay, but then his symptoms began to worsen quickly. He didn't want to go out as much anymore, he was behaving differently and his parents decided it'd be best if he went back on the full dosage. They made an appointment with his therapist to alter his lithium dosage. Three days before his appointment, Evan got into an argument with his mom about doing his homework, he locked himself in his room but his dad did go to check on him and saw that he was doing homework. His dad was putting his little brother to sleep and looked into Evan's room again a few minutes after talking to him about doing his homework. Evan wasn't in his room, and the window was open. Evan had jumped out his window and left a numbered list of reasons to live and die for, then deciding that dying was his solution.\n\nFamily\n\nHart Perry (father) \nEvan's father had a brother who was diagnosed with bipolar depression and committed suicide at the age of 21. Because of this, he did everything he could to prevent the same outcome for his son, Evan Perry. Hart did everything he could to make Evan happy, he would film with him, he would go to therapy with Evan, and he was very supportive. On the day that Evan committed suicide, Hart was the one that found him at the bottom, despite him previously checking in on Evan 5 minutes before, he couldn't stop the outcome.\n\nDana Perry (mother) \nEvan's mother was equally supportive of Evan, and it was her idea to film everything going on in Evan's life so that therapists would believe her and would have a better idea of what is going on. When Evan was five years old he actually explained to his mother how he was going to commit suicide, very detailed as well. She recorded it and put it in the documentary and it shows Evan climbing onto his bed and showing his mom how he was going to hang himself from the roof of his room. Dana Perry was very caring towards her son and tried everything she could to stop his story from ending so soon.\n\nNicholas Perry (brother) \nNicholas Perry was Evan's half brother from the dads side of the family. Throughout the documentary, Nicholas explained how most of the songs Evan wrote were very relatable for someone Nick's age. Nicholas was more than 5 years older than Evan, so while Evan was 7 years old, writing songs about his inner pain and demons in his head, Nicholas was in high school and experiencing this. However, there is a certain level of normality when a teenager experiences these thoughts compared to a seven year old. When Evan committed suicide, Nicholas rushed over to the Perry's house to be there for them. When the suicide note was discovered and Nicholas read it, he realized that everything Evan was experiencing was common. Evan was scared of failing, he wanted to fit in, and he was insecure. Nicholas along with every teenager feels this at one point or another, Evan just felt it to a different intensity. Because of this, Nicholas felt responsible to some degree, he believed that if he had talked to Evan and told him that it was perfectly normal and ok to feel that way then Evan would've been saved.\n\nProduction\nThe film was made by the boy's parents, director Dana Perry and cinematographer Hart Perry.

Koniecpolski was able to slow down the Swedes and retake some territory, notably Puck (March), and defeated the Swedes at the Battle of Hammerstein (also known as Battle of Czarne) in April. In May 1627 Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden reinforced his units, attacking the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in Pomerania. Polish forces, commanded by hetman Koniecpolski, numbered under 15,000. In the summer of 1627 Koniecpolski decided to advance to the major port of Pomerania, Danzig (Gdańsk). Both Koniecpolski and Gustav II Adolf desired a major battle. Koniecpolski needed to reduce the Swedes' strength, as their current numerical superiority made it difficult for his army to contain them; Gustav II Adolf meanwhile heard rumors of possible reinforcements for Koniecpolski arriving, and wanted to defeat him before his numerical superiority withered.\n\n Alexander was born as the fourth son of King Casimir IV of Poland and Elisabeth, daughter of the King Albert of Hungary. At the time of his father's death in 1492, his eldest brother Vladislaus had already become king of Bohemia (1471) and Hungary and Croatia (1490), and the next oldest brother, Casimir, had died (1484) after leading an ascetic and pious life in his final years, resulting in his eventual canonization.

Married to Katarzyna Starzycka in 1600, he was the father of Dominik Aleksander Kazanowski (1605–1648), voivode of Bracław. His family, the Kazanowski family, descendants of Mediolan Comeses, founded the town of Kazanów in 1566. Under Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, he was one of the commanding officers in the Battle of Górzno in 1629 against the Swedes. The discovery legend of the Madonna Bołszowiecka relates that during one of the battles against Tatars, Hetman Kazanowski discovered the icon of the Blessed Virgin. This was viewed by his troops as a miracle and boosted their morale, leading to a victory. Under King Władysław IV Vasa, he also participated in the wars against the Russian Tsardom.\n\nQuestion: Which country Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659)'s father is from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined. Cameron instead chose James Horner to compose the film's score. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on Aliens, but Titanic cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death. For the vocals heard throughout the film, subsequently described by Earle Hitchner of The Wall Street Journal as \"evocative\", Horner chose Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and he particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\").

In May 1922 he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of \n\nMaría Teresa Ferrari (11 October 188730 October 1956) was an Argentine educator, physician, and women's rights activist. She was the first female university professor in Latin America and one of the first women allowed to teach medicine. She was a pioneering researcher in women's health, studying the use of radiation therapy rather than surgery for uterine tumors and developing a vaginoscope that revolutionized women's health care in Brazil. She established the first maternity ward and gynecological services at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires in 1925, which provided the first incubation services in the country.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family, whose forebears had been involved in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then she earned her medical degree in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices that prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.\n\nFerrari undertook advanced medical study in Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she brought back to Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both civil and political rights for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.\n\nEarly life and education\nMaría Teresa Ferrari Alvarado was born on 11 October 1887 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Catalina Alvarado and David Ferrari White. Her family were among the founding citizens of Argentina: her paternal great-grandfather, Guillermo Pío White had provided money to assist the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata in defeating the Spanish and her maternal great-grandfather Rudesindo Alvarado had served in the Army of the Andes.\n\nFerrari enrolled at the Normal School Nº 1 of Buenos Aires, receiving her teaching certificate in 1903. For a woman of Ferrari's social class, paid work was unusual at the time. It was understood that in cases of financial necessity poor women might nurse or teach, because both were considered charitable, but upper-class women were expected to be no more than wives and mothers, managing their households. Ignoring convention, she embarked on a career in medicine, but also began teaching. Ferrari taught at the Colegio William Morris and the Escuela Nº 3 Bernardino Rivadavia. \nShe had studied psychology in a cutting-edge field known as \"experimental psychology\" and applied it to her classes, which caused the authorities to launch an investigation into her teaching methods. She was allowed to continue teaching, as her techniques of motivating students and encouraging them to learn proved effective.\n\nIn 1904, Ferrari enrolled in medical school at the National University of Buenos Aires while continuing to teach. There had been five other women in the history of Argentina who had earned medical degrees, and although her enrollment was not desired, there was no legal precedent to bar her admittance. In her first year, she was assigned to work as an assistant to  in his pathology research, which inspired her continued participation in medical research. Ferrari was awarded her medical degree in 1911.\n\nThat same year, she married another graduating physician, Nicolás M. Gaudino. Thereafter, sometimes Ferrari was known as María Teresa Ferrari de Gaudino or simply, María Teresa de Gaudino. In 1918 the couple had their only child, Maurio Nicholás Gaudino.\n\nCareer\n\nStruggle for a university professorship\nIn 1914, Ferrari started work at the obstetrics clinic of the Hospital Ramos Mejía of Buenos Aires. She applied to teach obstetrics at the university, but was turned down. In the proceedings of the Honorable Consejo Directivo (HCD) on 23 June 1915, it was stated: \"Despite their qualifications, for physiological and psychological reasons people of the feminine sex do not meet the required conditions to be engaged as professors in the Faculty [of Medicine]\". The following year, she was permitted to teach at the School of Midwifery, but this lacked the standing and credentials of a professorship at the university. When an opening for an alternate professorship appeared in 1919, Ferrari reapplied to the university, but was met with resistance. The members of the HCD delayed calling together the jurors to fill the vacancy until 1925, altering evidence, ignoring recommendations, and evading a decision. In 1926, she sent a detailed outline of her accomplishments to the committee, stating that she had taught in secondary schools for 20 years and had dedicated 15 years to her field of medicine, and had enrolled in university courses for nine years. One adviser, Dr. Speroni, having read her qualifications, sent a message to the dean imploring that they admit her, on the grounds that she was qualified, had shown dedication, and the school was understaffed. It was not until 1927, that the jurors met and her application for an alternate professorship was approved by a vote of thirteen to two. The news of the first female university professor in Latin America made headlines throughout Spanish-speaking countries. Newspapers in Argentina, including La Prensa, La Nación, La Razón, and others of the capital, El Censor in Gualeguaychú, Los Andes in Mendoza, Buenos Aires Sud in Florencio Varela, and the Italian La Patria degli Italiani and  Spanish El Diario Español carried stories of her triumph.\n\nIn the interim, rather than await a decision, Ferrari continued her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Italy. She was an assisting physician in the clinic of Marie Curie in Paris, as well as, in the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, D.C. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services that were available to women in Brazil, and the invention was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.\n\nFerrari was particularly interested in investigating alternatives to surgery and her studies on radiation therapy at the Curie Institute became the basis for a 1928 thesis on \"Treating Uterine tumors with radiation\". In 1925, she was appointed as the Argentine governmental delegate to the First Child Welfare Congress in Geneva. One of the major topics of the conference was the training of midwives in labor and hygiene practices. When her professorship was finally approved and she returned to Argentina, a celebration was held on 11 August 1927 at the Jockey Club of Buenos Aires, attended by the Minister of the Interior, ; the director of the Hospital Militar, Alberto Levenne; her research mentor, Joaquín Llambías; and many colleagues, peers, family members, and friends. Ferrari was appointed head of gynecology and maternity at Hospital Militar in Buenos Aires, a post which she held until 1939.\n\nMid-career development\nFerrari traveled to Mexico, the United States, and Canada in 1929, studying for eight months and attending conferences. In the United States, she participated in a Caesarean section at Columbia University, becoming the first Argentine to have performed a surgery in Washington, D.C. The baby born as a result of the surgery was named \"Argentina\". In 1930, she served as the Argentine delegate for the VII Medical Congress of Latin America held in Mexico  and presided over the first general session. She presented three papers; one addressed uterine tumors and the other two were about syphilis. She was also the delegate for the 2nd Congress of the Pan-American Medical Association in Panama. Between 1930 and 1932 she returned to the United States for additional studies, which focused on colibacillosis, sepsis, puerperal infections, and investigating whether vaccines could be developed to prevent the development of conditions resulting from childbirth or miscarriage.\n\nIn 1936, Ferrari founded the Argentina Federation of University Women (FAMU) with the goal of improving the social and legal standing of women and specifically, opening educational doors. She recruited professional women, including physicians, dentists, and attorneys and she organized scientific and cultural discussions and seminars. FAMU had regular courses in French, German, physical education, and mathematics, which it offered to its nearly 100 members. The political and civic limitations that threatened the careers of these women was clearly a concern and the organization's official statement supported enfranchisement as \"not a mere political aspiration for women, but a real right acquired by suffering, work, and deprivation experienced by women...\" In 1938, the Argentine organization joined the International Federation of University Women, which had served as Ferrari's inspiration.\n\nMilitary hospital and later career\n\nIn 1925, Ferrari was called to assist a military wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no gynecological unit. After she proposed that one be developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives became aware of the services, the growth was exponential and within five years, Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, the first of its kind in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Although radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the tenth anniversary of the maternity unit was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born during the previous ten years, together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile.\n\nPolitical shift to conservatism disrupts career\nFollowing the 1930 coup d'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.\n\nFerrari's disappointment at having to leave the hospital was offset in 1939, when she was finally made a full professor, receiving the title \"Profesor Extraordinario\" of the Obstetrics Faculty. Throughout the 1940s she continued her education, traveling to Cuba, New York, Pennsylvania, Peru, and Puerto Rico, publishing her research in a variety of journals. In 1946 she resigned as president of the Argentina Federation of University Women, but continued to represent the organization at conferences, such as the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres, which she attended in Guatemala City in 1947. \n\nAfter 43 years of teaching at Normal School Nº 3, Ferrari was forced into retirement by the Ministry of Education because she refused to participate in a political contribution fund. She also was asked to resign from her position as professor of psychology at Colegio William Morris. In 1952, rather than join the Peronista supporters and betray her ideals, she took full retirement. When elected, Perón had instituted a massive overhaul of the health system of Argentina. He appointed Ramón Carrillo as his health minister, and in the beginning, hospital beds were added, vaccination programs were instituted, a campaign against malaria was launched, and other improvements were made. However, by the early 1950s it was clear that policies were unevenly applied, implementation was erratic, and political cronyism was working against the provision of health services for those most in need. Two years after Ferrari resigned, Carrillo also resigned, disillusioned with the Perón administration.\n\nNational professional affiliations\nFerrari was a full member of the Argentine Association of Surgery, the Argentine Medical Association, and the Argentine Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Buenos Aires. She also was a correspondent member of the Society of Medicine and Surgery of Rio de Janeiro. \n \nFerrari died on 30 October 1956 in Buenos Aires.\n\nSelected works\nFerrari's works were all in French or Spanish and outlined her research on various scientific and gynecological topics. They included the following:\n\nSee also\nTimeline of women in science\n\nReferences\n\n1887 births\n1956 deaths\nArgentine women's rights activists\nPeople from Buenos Aires\nArgentine women physicians\nArgentine women writers\nUniversity of Buenos Aires alumni\nUniversity of Buenos Aires faculty\nArgentine medical writers\nWomen academics\n\n She worked for a while at a school in Udaipur before moving on to meet Gandhi with whom she remained for eight years at his ashram at Sevagram in Wardha. Here she was deeply involved in Gandhi's idea of nai talim or basic education and worked to empower women and protect the environment at Sevagram. It was Gandhi who named her Sarla Behn. The heat and bouts of malaria afflicted her at Sevagram and with Gandhi’s concurrence she headed out to the more salubrious climes of Kausani in the Almora district of the United Provinces in 1940. She made it her home, establishing an ashram \n\n Maganlal Khushalchand Gandhi (1883&ndash;1928) was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. He was a grandson of an uncle of Mohandas [i.e., Mahatma Gandhi], and he died of typhoid at Patna on 23 April 1928. Maganlal Gandhi is cited in many works of Mahatma Gandhi. It is he who suggested that the word Satyagraha should define Gandhi's nonviolence methods. According to Gandhi, Maganlal was the heart and soul of Sabarmati Ashram. He followed Gandhi in South Africa in 1903 \"in the hope of making a bit of fortune.\" However, he ended up following his uncle's self-imposed poverty and joined the Phoenix Settlement.\n\n with regard to Gandhi all criticism is silenced. I was never particularly enthusiastic about Gandhi, but now I am completely converted. He is one of the most sympathetic humans I have ever met, he is truly a great man.» Meyer also visited Syria, Mexico and Alaska. Meyer was born in Tønsberg to an affluent family. Her father gave her a Kodak folding camera for her travels, which seems to have led to her professional choice later. She joined the Oslo Camera Club in 1932, and then traveled to Berlin in 1937 to study photography at the Reimann School, where she studied with Walter Peterhans and Otto Croy. She worked as an apprentice for Joszef Pécsi in Budapest before returning to Norway, where she spent the war years. Meyer produced material for various publications including National Geographic Magazine and Aftenposten.\n\nQuestion: Who was born earlier, Ela Gandhi or Sebastián Borensztein?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties.\n \nSlate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. In particular, he cites a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMore recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE. For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity.

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties.\n \nSlate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. In particular, he cites a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMore recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE. For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity. These CTE symptoms include cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems.\n\nAfter comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue. The New York Times discovered emails directly referencing removing \"unflattering moments for the NFL” and removing “most of the bite” out of the film “for legal reasons with the NFL\". Landesman stated the changes were made \"to portray the characters and story as accurately as possible to reduce the chance that the league could attack the filmmakers for taking too much creative license\".\n\nSee also\n League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\n Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis\n Concussions in American football\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n2015 films\n2015 biographical drama films\n2010s sports drama films\n2015 thriller drama films\nAfrican-American biographical dramas\nAmerican films\nAmerican biographical drama films\nAmerican sports drama films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nEnglish-language films\nBiographical films about sportspeople\nDrama films based on actual events\nFilms about diseases\nFilms about suicide\nFilms based on newspaper and magazine articles\nFilms set in 2002\nFilms set in 2005\nFilms set in California\nFilms set in New York City\nFilms set in Pittsburgh\nFilms set in Washington, D.C.\nFilms shot in Pennsylvania\nFilms shot in Pittsburgh\nFilms with screenplays by Peter Landesman\nSports films based on actual events\nVillage Roadshow Pictures films\nColumbia Pictures films\nFilms scored by James Newton Howard\nFilms directed by Peter Landesman\nCultural depictions of players of American football\nCultural depictions of American men\n2015 drama films\n\n In McCluskieganj, Bihar an old Anglo-Indian town in 1979, two men, Nandu and Brian, stare at a dead body inside the trunk of their car.

During this time, he worked at the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City in Beijing and later became a member of the prestigious Central Research Institute of Culture & History. During the Cultural Revolution, like most Chinese intellectuals, he was sent down to the countryside; there he cared for pigs and oxen. Later, he became a researcher for the State Administration of Cultural Heritage. During the 1980s, he made regular contributions to the newspaper China Daily. Through other channels, he published much about the investigation he conducted, as is found in the dozens of books he left behind. His publications are in some cases the only available information on specific topics.\n\n During the 1970s and 1980s, Xie proposed and led the National geochemical mapping project and the China-Regional Geochemistry-National Reconnaissance (RGNR) Project. He also technically sponsored these programs, and initially emphasized and demonstrated by mapping the gold mines in China's territory (see also Gold mining in China). This RGNR project lasted for at least 24 years and scanned more than six million km2 of China's mainland surface. The useful information offered from this mega program also contributed to about 80% new mineral discoveries within recent two decades in China. In the 1990s, Xie also contributed to the international standardization for methodology of world geochemical mapping. Xie also further developed some new approaches of searching for buried giant ore deposits. Xie also proposed several deep-penetrating geochemical techniques and methods.\n\n Wang lived in Tibet in the 1980s, where he worked as an art director for the military district of Tibet. In 1982, he created the illustrations for two picture books recounting the Tibetan folklores, The Story of Akhu Tönpa and The Swan. The latter won a second prize in the Exhibition of Fine Arts of the Tibet Autonomous Region. In 1986, with The Eternity, a wood carving painting, he was awarded the Creative Excellence Award in the fifth Exhibition of Fine Arts of Tibet; and several of his sketches were published in the Tibetan newspaper Lhasa Evening, in the same year.

He joined the Communist Party of China in May 1974. Wang entered the workforce in March 1971 as a railway worker, then train conductor, with the Harbin Railway Bureau in Heilongjiang province. As part of his work in railways, he was stationed in Mudanjiang. He served as Communist Youth League leader, then party chief, of the Mudanjiang train station, then deputy chief of the Mudanjiang Branch of the Harbin Bureau. In 1996, he was named head of the Hohhot Railway Bureau in Inner Mongolia, where he served until January 1999. He was then transferred to work for the Ministry of Railways, where he served as head of the political department.

In the hearing, Scott's defense attorney acknowledged her client intentionally harmed her child during the six-week period from 1 May to 12 June 2007, and conceded that the state could prove Scott committed the most serious of those acts during this time period.\n\nJudge Dwyer, again presiding, accepted Scott's plea and convicted her of abuse from 1 May to 12 June 2007. As part of the plea agreement, fourteen other charges against Scott were dropped, including allegations of assault and reckless endangerment. Dwyer ordered Scott to remain on home detention while awaiting trial and prohibited her from having contact with her children or entering Fort Detrick.\n\nIn a six-hour sentencing hearing on 8 May 2008, defense attorney Drawbaugh urged Dwyer to confine Scott to her home, allowing her to continue intensive psychotherapy to deal with severe mental illnesses. However, after hearing prosecution testimony as well, Judge Dwyer ordered Scott to serve 15 years of a 25-year sentence for the actions to which she had pleaded guilty.\n\nSee also\n\n Beverley Allitt\n David Southall\n Julie Gregory, victim of Munchausen by proxy, author of the memoir Sickened\n Murder of Dee Dee Blanchard, the 2015 killing of a Missouri woman by her daughter, Gypsy Rose Blanchard, whom she had made pretend to be seriously ill.\n Murder of Garnett Spears, the 2014 killing of a New York boy whose mother also suffered from Munchausen by proxy.\n\nReferences\n\n1975 births\nChild abuse in the United States\nPeople from Frederick, Maryland\nLiving people\nPeople with factitious disorders\n21st-century American criminals\nCriminals from Maryland\nAmerican female criminals\nPrisoners and detainees of Maryland\n\n On 20 December 2009, she gave birth to a baby girl.\n\n  Olga was born on 15 November 1895.

A member of a Connacht ecclesiastical family, Ua Dubhthaigh was born during the reign of King Áed Ua Ruairc (r. 1067–1087). His family were natives of Lissonuffy in what is now north-east County Roscommon, and produced a number of abbots and bishops.

It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained a copy of the important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. It seems he also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it seems he left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.

He was a fifth generation descendant of Colgú mac Faílbe Flaind (died 678), a previous king. Tnúthgal appears in some king lists but this is suspect. He is not mentioned in the Irish annals and his death date of 820 is based on the accession of Feidlimid mac Cremthanin (died 847) in that year. A confusion between him and Tnúthgal mac Artrach (died circa 807) may have occurred.

Cú-cen-máthair succeeded Máenach mac Fíngin of the Eóganacht Chaisil, the Cashel branch of the kindred. A surviving poem attributed to Luccrech moccu Chérai contains a list of his ancestors back to Adam. Cú-cen-máthair died in 665 of a plague which killed many others as recorded in the Irish annals. The king lists have him followed as King of Munster by Colgú mac Faílbe Flaind of the Eóganacht Chaisil.

The first monks of the abbey were from Godfrey's entourage. They managed the Church of Saint Mary, the Grotto of the Agony, and the Church of Gethsemane, all located near the Mount of Olives. Arnulf of Chocques renovated the church in 1112. Morphia, wife of King Baldwin II, was buried there, starting a precedent whereby queens of Jerusalem were buried apart from their husbands, who were entombed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1120, Baldwin II installed his cousin Gilduin of Le Puiset, son of Hugh I of Le Puiset, as abbot.

It won 1960 Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize as well as 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source along with many other awards. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (1961). With the start of the Cold War, writers, still considered the primary auteurs, were all the more reluctant to take up script writing, and the early 1950s saw only a handful of feature films completed during any year. The death of Stalin was a relief to some people, and all the more so was the official trashing of his public image as a benign and competent leader by Nikita Khrushchev two years later. This latter event gave filmmakers the margin of comfort they needed to move away from the narrow stories of socialist realism, expand its boundaries, and begin work on a wider range of entertaining and artistic Soviet films. Notable films include:\n\n Age 13 is an educational film by Sid Davis released in 1955. It is property of the public domain.

In 560 BC King Croesus of Lydia incurs the wrath of the sorceress Queen Attossa he had promised to marry, when he chooses the beautiful Delarai of Persia instead.

But Aesop also has eyes for Delarai. This expensive, lavish Technicolor production of plaster Grecian temples and painted skies was Wanger's second attempt to film the novel, and ended up costing $1.6 million and losing Universal some $800,000. One source describes it as a kitschy \"Maria Montez vehicle without Maria Montez\".

After 1772, when her spouse was made riksråd (councillor of state), she was known at court as riksrådinna, the feminine equivalent, and thereby given a high status. She was described as a close friend of Gustav III during his first years as a monarch: she belonged to the intimate circle of debate-partners with whom he stayed up late at night discussing, and he found her intelligent and cultivated.

He spent the early years of his life in the United Kingdom and received British nationality in 1938. By age 14 he was fluent in five languages. He was interested in geography, history, philosophy.

He was born during the reign of his grandfather Nicholas I. In disposition, Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle Emperor Alexander I, who could have been given the title of \"the first gentleman of Europe\".

He also appeared in a few films, and is best known for his role in the 1932 movie Freaks. His lifelong career on the outdoor entertainment circuit as a major sideshow attraction with Barnum & Bailey, among others, made him a popular cultural icon.\n\nBiography\nSchlitzie's true birth date, name, location and parents are unknown; the information on his death certificate and gravesite indicate that he was born on September 10, 1901, in The Bronx, New York, though some sources have claimed that he was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Claims that he was born in Yucatán, Mexico, are mistaken reflections of Schlitzie's occasional fanciful billing as \"Maggie, last of the Aztec Children\". Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career.\n\nSchlitzie was born with microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that left him with an unusually small brain and skull, a small stature (), myopia, and severe intellectual disability. It is possible that these features were caused by Seckel syndrome. It was said Schlitzie had the cognition of a three-year-old: he was unable to care fully for himself and could speak only in monosyllabic words and form a few simple phrases. However, he was able to perform simple tasks, and it is believed that he could understand most of what was said to him, as he had a very quick reaction time and the ability to mimic. Those who knew Schlitzie described him as an affectionate, exuberant, sociable person who loved dancing, singing, and being the center of attention, performing for anyone he could stop and talk with.\n\nCareer\nOn the sideshow circuit, microcephalic people were usually promoted as \"pinheads\" or \"missing links\", and Schlitzie was billed under such titles as \"The Last of the Aztecs\", \"The Monkey Girl\", and . In some sideshows, he was paired with another microcephalic performer.\n\nSchlitzie was often dressed in a muumuu and presented as either female or androgynous to add to the mystique of his unusual appearance. Those who knew him alternately used masculine and feminine pronouns. His urinary incontinence, which obliged him to wear diapers, made dresses practical for his care needs, although it is possible that the incontinence did not develop until later in life and was simply a side-effect of age.\n\nThe sideshow circuit was a tremendous success for Schlitzie; throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was employed by many upscale circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, Tom Mix Circus, Crafts 20 Big Shows, and Foley & Burke Carnival. In 1928, Schlitzie made his film debut in The Sideshow, a drama set in a circus, which featured a variety of actual sideshow performers.\n\nFreaks and later work\nSchlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Like The Sideshow, Freaks takes place at a carnival and features a number of genuine sideshow performers, including conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, \"The Living Torso\" Prince Randian, and dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. Two other \"pinheads\" also appear in the film. When referring to Schlitzie, other actors use feminine pronouns.\n\nWhen Freaks premiered in 1932, cinema audiences were scandalized by the appearance of sideshow performers. The United Kingdom banned the film for thirty years. The film was a financial failure, and Browning, although he went on to make several more films for MGM, retired in 1940.\n\nSchlitzie appeared in bit roles in various movies and is credited with a role in the 1934 exploitation film Tomorrow's Children as a mentally defective criminal who undergoes forced sterilization.\n\nWhile Schlitzie was performing with the Tom Mix Circus in 1935, George Surtees, a chimpanzee trainer with a trained-chimpanzee act in the show, adopted him, becoming his legal guardian. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \"Princess Bibi\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie.\n\nHospitalization\nUnder George Surtees' care, Schlitzie continued performing the sideshow circuit; after Surtees' death in 1965, his daughter, who was not in show business, committed Schlitzie to a Los Angeles county hospital.\n\nSchlitzie remained hospitalized for some time until he was recognized by sword swallower Bill \"Frenchy\" Unks, who happened to be working at the hospital during the off-season. According to Unks, Schlitzie seemed to miss the carnival badly, and being away from the public eye had made him very depressed. Hospital authorities determined that the best care for Schlitzie would be to make him a ward of Unks' employer, showman Sam Alexander, and return him to the sideshow, where he remained until 1968.\n\nFinal years\nIn his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. He liked going to MacArthur Park at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, where he would visit the lake with his guardian, feeding the pigeons and ducks and performing for passersby.\n\nDeath\nOn September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \"Shlitze Surtees\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights.\n\nCultural legacy\n\nIn the 1960s, Freaks was rediscovered and enjoyed a long run as one of the first midnight movies, becoming a cult classic, and in 1994 it was selected by the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film became the public's major exposure to Schlitzie, who remains one of the more memorable characters in the film.\n\nSchlitzie's iconic image has lent itself to many products, including masks, hats, shirts, models, clocks, snow globes, and dolls. Additionally, Schlitzie has been cited as an inspiration for Bill Griffith's comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, and the circus freak Bertram in Red Dead Redemption 2. Griffith has recently released Nobody's Fool, a graphic novel biography of Schlitzie.  The Ramones song 'Pinhead' was inspired by him.\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Portrait (2009) of Schlitzie by illustrator Drew Friedman\n The Human Marvels Biography\n\n1901 births\n1971 deaths\nEntertainers with dwarfism\nMale actors from New York City\nSideshow performers\nActors with dwarfism\nDeaths from pneumonia in California\nEntertainers from the Bronx\n20th-century American male actors\nPeople with microcephaly\n\n John Beaird (April 9, 1953 – July 9, 1993) was a screenwriter and film producer.

Doyle has gained a reputation as a sitcom \"showrunner\" brought in when the original showrunners have been fired from troubled shows, helping the series to recover and accumulate enough episodes for syndication. Doyle is also widely credited with originating the term \"bay leaf,\" a term of art in television comedy. A bay leaf is material written into a script with the explicit intention that it would be removed later, either in subsequent drafts or in editing of the finished episode. Bay leaves are generally used to address unwanted network and studio notes, the \"heavy-handed suggestions given by studio executives\".\n\n Spider's Web is a 2002 American direct-to-video film directed by Paul Levine and starring Stephen Baldwin and Kari Wuhrer.

It was the longest day imaginable\". Wuhrer's breast implants encapsulated during filming, which she noticed while preparing to film a nude scene, so she had them removed later that year.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Boogeyman is a 2005 supernatural horror film directed by Stephen Kay and starring Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, and Lucy Lawless. The film is a take on the classic \"boogeyman\", or monster in the closet, who is the main antagonist of the film. The plot concerns a young man, Tim Jensen, who must confront the childhood terror that has affected his life. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, often citing a generic and unoriginal plot as the main criticism. Despite receiving negative reviews from critics, the film was a financial success, and was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Boogeyman 2 (2007) and Boogeyman 3 (2008).\n\nQuestion: Do both films Fig Leaves and Boogeyman (Film) have the directors that share the same nationality?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Leone died on 30 April 1989 of a heart attack at the age of 60. Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the Siege of Leningrad, set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire US$100 million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was cancelled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film. In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called Leningrad. The film has yet to go into production and Morricone was cagey as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature.\n\n The film opens with Singapore apparently suffering an immense invasion, with iconic Singaporean landmarks coming under fire and numerous civilian casualties.

Both of his parents lived their early years as members of ruling imperial families that were deposed before they reached adulthood, leaving them to adjust to life in straitened circumstances, in exile or under surveillance, and sometimes in flight from their ancestral nations. The Kaiser lived in the Netherlands under banishment from Germany when Michael was born. However, by the time Michael was ten years old, both his great-grandfather and grandfather had died, leaving his father \n\n brother Canute Lavard, but he later turned to the murderer Magnus I of Sweden because he had desires for the Danish throne himself. He tried to gain recognition as king by the name of Harald IV and was successful in receiving the homage of Jutland, but he was defeated along with Magnus Nilsson at the Battle of Fotevik in Skåne, 1134. He fled after the defeat but he was taken captive near Vejle on Jutland and decapitated together with eight of his sons. Harald Kesja had married to Ragnild Magnusdotter, the daughter of King Magnus III of Norway. They had four or six sons: Harald Kesja had also further nine illegitimate sons of whom we know the names of six of them: \n\n He was married twice, first to Inger Skavlan (1852–99), and was a brother-in-law of Olaf Skavlan, Sigvald Skavlan, Aage Skavlan and Harald Skavlan. After her death, he married Marie Michelet (1872–1960), sister of Simon Michelet, in 1900. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1902.\n\n Harald the Younger (from \"Herioldus iunior\", how he is named in the Annales Xantenses) was a Viking leader and a member of the Danish royal family. He has sometimes been mistakenly identified with Harald Klak, who was in fact his uncle and probable namesake. His brother was Rorik of Dorestad. In 841 the Emperor Lothair I granted the isle of Walcheren to Harald and his brother as a fief (beneficium) rewarding him for the attacks he had launched against Lothair's father, Louis the Pious, during the civil wars of the 830s. Since at the time Harald was a pagan, whereas the population of Walcheren was Christian, this incident is \n\n regarded him as a \"persecutor of the Christian faith and a demon-worshipper\" and his receipt of a benefice as an \"utterly detestable crime\" —he may have been baptised as a young man at the imperial court. Harald Klak and his family, perhaps including Harald, were baptised at Mainz in 826, with Lothair standing as godfather. Harald's son Godfrid Haraldsson and one of his nephews remained at the imperial court even after the elder Harald left. Since Godfrid remained allied with Lothair until the mid-840s, it is possible that Harald was his cousin who remained with Lothair after 826 and began raiding Louis the Pious's Frisian lands in 834.\n\nQuestion: Who is Prince Harald Of Schaumburg-Lippe's maternal grandfather?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The representative of one branch, Gjergj Dukagjini, appears as an owner of some villages near Lezhë and a commander of a force of 40 cavalry and 100 infantry. Although the Venetian Senate accepted his services, believing in his loyalty, he supported Zetan lord Balša III and fought against Venice when Balša III captured Venetian possessions near Scutari. Gjergj Dukagjini died before 1409. In 1409, the Venetian Senate pardoned his son Nikola (Nikollë) for the activities of his father, based on the request of Dimitrije Jonima. According \n\n Principality of Kastrioti (1389–1444) was one of the most important principalities in Medieval Albania. It was created by Gjon Kastrioti and then ruled by the national hero of Albania, Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. Gjon Kastrioti had originally only two small villages, which probably emblem of the eagle family with a black two-headed, even if it can provide different interpretations. In short time Gjon Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania.

In a short time, John Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania. He married Voisava Tripalda who bore 5 daughters, Mara, Jela, Angjelina, Vlajka, and Mamica, and 4 sons, Reposh, Stanisha, Kostandin and Gjergj Kastrioti (who would come to be known as Skanderbeg). Gjon Kastrioti was among those who opposed the early incursion of Ottoman Bayezid I, however his resistance was ineffectual. The Sultan, having accepted his submissions, obliged him to pay tribute to ensure the fealty of local rulers, and to send his three sons Gjergj Kastrioti to the Sultan's court as hostages. After his conversion to Islam, the young Skanderbeg attended military school in Edirne and led many victorious battles for the Ottoman Empire. For his military victories, he received the title Arnavutlu İskender Bey, (Albanian: Skënderbe shqiptari, English: Lord Alexander, the Albanian) comparing Kastrioti's military brilliance to that of Alexander the Great.\n\n Gjon II Kastrioti (Ioanne Castrioto, Giovanni Castrioto; 1456–1502), was the son of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, the Albanian national hero, and of Donika Kastrioti, daughter of the powerful Albanian prince, Gjergj Arianiti. He was for a short time Lord of Kruja after his father's death, then Duke of San Pietro in Galatina (1485), Count of Soleto, Signore of Monte Sant'Angelo and San Giovanni Rotondo. In 1495, Ferdinand I of Naples gave him the title of the Signore of Gagliano del Capo and Oria. While in his teens, he was forced to leave the country after the death of his father in 1468. He is known also for his role in the Albanian Uprisings of 1481, when, after reaching the Albanian coast from Italy, settling in Himara, he led a rebellion against the Ottomans. In June 1481, he supported forces of Ivan Crnojević to successfully recapture Zeta from the Ottomans. He was unable to re-establish the Kastrioti Principality and liberate Albania from the Ottomans, and he retired in Italy after three years of war in 1484.\n\n With the death of his father, Skanderbeg, in 1468, Gjon II Kastrioti migrated with his mother, Donika Kastrioti, and for a short period of time lived in the Kingdom of Naples, in the properties he had inherited from his father, Skanderbeg. He was fighting against the Ottomans in Otranto, when representatives of the Albanian insurgents asked Gjon II Kastrioti to return to Albania and he accepted their request. Taking advantage of the interest of the Neapolitan court at this time in expanding the front of the war against the Ottoman invaders, Gjon II Kastrioti managed to obtain from King Ferdinand the necessary means of navigation \n\nQuestion: Where was the place of burial of Gjon Kastrioti Ii's father?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He removed with his parents in the early 1860s to Alton, Illinois, where he was educated. He and his first wife, Maria Tilton, had a daughter, Theodosia Burr, whom they named after Theodosia Burr Alston, the daughter of Aaron Burr, whose ship on which she was sailing was lost near Cape Hatteras in a storm in 1813. Maria died in 1860. His second wife was Caroline Garnier; they were married in St. Louis on February 6, 1873. Dimmock died November 18, 1909, in St. John's Hospital, St. Louis.

Bishop Simms was also organist of St. Mary’s Chapel in Birmingham He was a violinist, and one of the orchestra at the Birmingham Festivals from 1805. In 1809 he gave the opening recital on the new Elliot organ in the Church of St John the Baptist, Bromsgrove. His brother, James Simms, was then the organist at this church for some 45 years.

Alongside Cardinal William Conway, Simms chaired the first official ecumenical meeting between the leaders of Ireland's Protestant Churches and the Catholic Church in Ballymascanlon Hotel, Dundalk, Co. Louth on 26 September 1973, an important meeting amidst the increasing violence in Northern Ireland. The meeting was protested by Ian Paisley. He was the uncle of mathematician David J. Simms. Simms is interred with his wife, Mercy Felicia née Gwynn (1915–1998), in the cemetery attached to St. Maelruain's Church, Tallaght, County Dublin.\n\n Simms was born in Hamburg \"of an old Warwickshire family\", the son of Frederick Louis Simms and his wife Antonia née Hermans.

He was educated in Germany and London and at the Polytechnischer Verein in Berlin after completing an apprenticeship with AG fur Automatischen Verkauf in Hamburg and Berlin. In a 1907 trip to the Alps, Simms discovered a waterfall near the village of Holzgau, now called the Simmswasserfall. Simms may have spread his talents a little thinly to be able to show a single outstanding achievement. His lasting significance is in his role as a catalyst and intermediary between Britain and Europe and to a lesser extent USA.
