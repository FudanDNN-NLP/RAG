The album features the Chipmunks and Chipettes singing Disney songs. A footnote on the back of the CD case stated that The Walt Disney Company neither sponsored nor endorsed the album. However, coincidentally, the home entertainment division Buena Vista Home Video (now Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) had released several Chipmunks cartoons on home video in the early 1990s.\n\n A Very Merry Chipmunk is a 1994 music album by Alvin and the Chipmunks, released by Sony Wonder. It is their fourth Christmas album. The album reached #147 on the Billboard 200. It was the first in a series of 25 Christmas compilation albums put forth by Turner Broadcasting company. The fact that it appeared on the Billboard 200, caused Sony to print 5,000 more copies, resulting in a sudden decline in pricing. Wal-Mart put a special on it for 97 cents shortly after Christmas 1994.\n\n \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\" is a novelty Christmas song written by Ross Bagdasarian (under the stage name of David Seville) in 1958. Bagdasarian sang and recorded the song, varying the tape speeds to produce high-pitched \"chipmunk\" voices, with the vocals credited to Alvin and the Chipmunks, Seville's cartoon virtual band. The song won three Grammy Awards in 1958, for Best Comedy Performance, Best Children's Recording, and Best Engineered Record (non-classical).\n\n David \"Dave\" Seville is a fictional character, the producer and manager of the fictional singing group Alvin and the Chipmunks. The character was created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. Bagdasarian had used the name \"David Seville\" as his stage name prior to the creation of the Chipmunks, while writing and recording novelty records in the 1950s. One of the records, recorded in 1958 under the David Seville stage name, was \"Witch Doctor\", featuring a sped-up high-pitched vocal technique. Bagdasarian would later use that technique in \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", which would introduce both Alvin and the Chipmunks as a singing group and \n\n The Very Best of The Chipmunks with David Seville is a 1975 music album by Alvin and the Chipmunks, released by United Artists, containing ten tracks, and apparently re-released in 1995 by Capitol Records containing nine tracks.\n\nQuestion: Who was the man behind The Chipmunks?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer Cameron Mackintosh ran in the West End between October 8, 1985 and July 13, 2019, making it the longest-running musical in the West End and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of The Fantasticks. Set in early 19th-century France during the 1832 June Rebellion, \n\n and Best Original Score. Subsequently, numerous tours and international and regional productions have been staged, as well as concert and broadcast productions. Several recordings have also been made. A Broadway revival opened in 2006 at the Broadhurst Theatre and closed in 2008, and a second Broadway revival opened in 2014 at the Imperial Theatre and closed in September 2016. The show was placed first in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of Britain's \"Number One Essential Musicals\" in 2005, receiving more than forty percent of the votes. A film version directed by Tom Hooper was released at the end of 2012 to generally positive reviews as well as numerous awards nominations, winning three Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and four British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA).\n\n John Cudia is a classical singer and a musical theatre actor who has played many of the biggest roles in musical theatre on Broadway. Born on September 21, 1970, Cudia was raised in Toms River, New Jersey. He graduated from Monsignor Donovan High School (since renamed as Donovan Catholic High School). Cudia began his career in regional theater. His credits include Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar, Lieutenant Cable in South Pacific and Tony in West Side Story. His first role on Broadway was Feuilly in Les Misérables. He went on to play many of the lead male roles in Les Misérables, including Jean Valjean. Cudia's claim to fame is his critically acclaimed portrayal of the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. His first encounter with Phantom occurred \n\n then-wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Lloyd Webber's Cats as the longest running show on Broadway.

As Heath was unable to persuade the Liberals to form a coalition, Wilson returned to 10 Downing Street on 4 March 1974 as prime minister of a minority Labour Government. He gained a three-seat majority in another election later that year, on 10 October 1974. One of the key issues addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on British membership of the European Community (EC) which took place in June 1975: Labour had pledged in its February 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and then to consult the public in a referendum on whether Britain should stay in on the new terms. Although the government recommended a vote in favour of continued membership, the cabinet was split on the issue, and Ministers were allowed to campaign on different sides of the question. The referendum resulted in a near two-to-one majority in favour of Britain remaining in the EC.\n\n On 21 June 1895, the government lost a vote in committee on army supply by just seven votes. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Rosebery remained the Liberal leader for another year, then permanently retired from politics.\n\n In 1830, following the death of George IV and when the Duke of Wellington resigned on the question of Parliamentary reform, the Whigs finally returned to power, with Grey as prime minister. In 1831, he was made a member of the Order of the Garter. His term was a notable one, seeing passage of the Reform Act 1832, which finally saw the reform of the House of Commons, and the abolition of slavery throughout almost all of the British Empire in 1833 with the Slavery Abolition Act. As the years had passed, however, Grey had become more conservative, and he was cautious about initiating more far-reaching reforms, particularly since he \n\n a war or serious confrontation with the other powers. He remained as prime minister until Gladstone's Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish nationalists at the 1892 general election. The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900. He relinquished the premiership to his nephew Arthur Balfour in 1902 and died in 1903. He was the last prime minister to serve from the House of Lords. Historians agree that Salisbury was a strong and effective \n\n Salisbury was back in office, although without a conservative majority; he depended on the Liberal Unionists, led by Lord Hartington. Maintaining the alliance forced Salisbury to make concessions in support of progressive legislation regarding Irish land purchases, education, and county councils. His nephew Arthur Balfour acquired a strong reputation for resolute coercion in Ireland, and was promoted to leadership in the Commons in 1891. The Prime Minister proved adept at his handling of the press, as Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted in his diary in 1887 he was: \"the prime minister most accessible to the press. He is not prone to give information: but when he does, he gives it freely, & his information can always be relied on.\"\n\nQuestion: Who was the next British Prime Minister after Arthur Balfour?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the time, Wham! was projecting a hard, politically motivated image, with \"Bad Boys\" one of a number of songs projecting a stance of mood and youthful independence, a \"soul boy – dole boy\" theme. The single was also released in the United States, peaking at number 60. It was the duo's first time on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, although they were listed as Wham!-UK. \"Bad Boys\" became the biggest hit from the debut album, although it would be usurped by \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" from the album Make It Big in 1984, which became the first of four UK number-one singles the duo would enjoy. George quickly denounced \"Bad Boys\" as a song he hated, stating it was \"like an albatross round my neck\". The song was famously omitted from the 1997 compilation album The Best of Wham!: If You Were There..., despite the album including tracks that were not released as singles.\n\n of Bread's \"Everything I Own\", he is considered a major icon of this era. Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood's initially controversial dance-pop gave them three consecutive UK number ones in 1984, until they faded away in the mid-1980s. Dead or Alive, also from Liverpool, was another popular dance-pop band in the mid-1980s. It was fronted by lead singer Pete Burns. Probably the most successful British pop band of the era were the duo Wham! with an unusual mix of disco, soul, ballads and even rap, who had eleven top ten hits in the UK, six of them number ones, between 1982 and 1986. George Michael \n\n first time that the record aired on any radio station.

Michael, noted for his energetic style, was hired by WABC in New York City; his first on-air stint there was on the evening of September 9, 1974. Michael now not only was entering the nation's largest media market; he also succeeded radio legend \"Cousin \n\n The group had reached number 8 with \"The Message\" in 1982. George Michael debuted with \"Careless Whisper\" in August 1984, the first credited hit single separate from Wham!. The song spent three weeks at number-one. Queen's Freddie Mercury first top 10 single as a solo artist, \"Love Kills\", got to a high of number 10. Philip Oakey was the lead singer in The Human League, who had debuted in 1981 with three top 10 singles including \"Don't You Want Me\". His collaboration with Giorgio Moroder marked the first single to reach the top 10 in his own right. Limahl had been part of Kajagoogoo until his sacking in 1983, his biggest song with the band \n\n the early 1980s.

He soon fell into ill-health, and died at Biarritz, France, on 2 July 1858, aged 35. She appeared at Jullien's promenade concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857, when her ballad singing, the branch of art in which lay her greatest power, was much applauded. After her husband's death she took part in concerts in London and the country towns.

Ferrier was born in Montpellier. He had already produced several comedies when in 1873 he secured real success with two short pieces, Chez l'avocat and Les Incendies de Massoulard. Others of his numerous plays are Les Compensations (1876); L'Art de tramper les femmes (1890), with Émile de Najac. One of Ferrier's biggest successes was the production with Fabrice Carré of Josephine vendue par ses sœurs (1886), an opera bouffée with music by Victor Roger. His opera libretti include La Marocaine (1879), music of Jacques Offenbach; Le Chevalier d'Harmental (1896) after the play of Alexandre Dumas, père, for the music of André Messager; La Fille de Tabarin (1901), with Victorien Sardou, music of Gabriel Pierné. Ferrier died in Nouan-le-Fuzelier (Loir-et-Cher), at age 77.\n\n In 2006, Watts won the Kathleen Ferrier Award.

Written by the series' theme song composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez for the seventh episode, \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\", the song was performed by star Kathryn Hahn, with Lopez, Eric Bradley, Greg Whipple, Jasper Randall, and Gerald White serving as backup singers. The song drew inspiration from the theme songs from The Munsters and The Addams Family. \"Agatha All Along\" went viral after appearing in \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\", and was officially released on February 23, 2021, as part of the WandaVision: Episode 7 (Original Soundtrack).

By 1978, however, Coolidge hit number 6 on the Billboard 100 with the platinum selling Anytime…Anywhere, an album that spawned three Top 20 hits. Although he was now an established film star, Kristofferson’s previous album, Easter Island, was a commercial disappointment. The couple’s marriage was floundering by this time - in the A&E episode of Biography about his life, Kristofferson admits to having a steamy love affair with costar Sarah Miles on the set of 1976's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea - and Natural Act would be their final studio album together.\n\n Natural Act is the third and final duet album by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, released in 1978 on A&M Records.

Although Victoria's net interstate migration has fluctuated, the population of the Melbourne statistical division has grown by about 70,000 people a year since 2005. Until 2020, Melbourne had attracted the largest proportion of international overseas immigrants (48,000) finding it outpacing Sydney's international migrant intake on percentage, along with having strong interstate migration from Sydney and other capitals due to more affordable housing and cost of living. In recent years, Melton, Wyndham and Casey, part of the Melbourne statistical division, recorded the highest growth rate of all local government areas in Australia. After a trend of declining population density since World War II, the city has seen increased density in the inner and western suburbs, aided in part by Victorian Government planning, such as Postcode 3000 and Melbourne 2030, which have aimed to curtail urban sprawl.

Most immigrants are skilled, but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees. In 2018 the five largest immigrant groups were those born in England (4%), Mainland China (2.6%), India (2.4%), New Zealand (2.3%) and the Philippines (1.1%).

Melbourne dominated Australia's population growth for the 15th year in a row as of 2017, adding 125,424 people between 2016 and 2017, and boomed past 5 million people in 2019. Population growth is however projected to significantly decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic slowdown. Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia. Melbourne is home to residents from 200 countries and territories, who speak over 233 languages and dialects and follow 116 religious faiths. The earliest known inhabitants of the broad area that later became known as Melbourne were Indigenous Australians – specifically, at the time of European settlement, the Bunurong, Wurundjeri and Wathaurong tribal groups. Melbourne is still a centre of Aboriginal life — consisting of local groups and indigenous groups from other parts of Australia, as most indigenous Victorians were displaced from their traditional lands during colonization – with the Aboriginal community in the city numbering over 20,000 persons (0.6% of the population).\n\n South Wales in having the largest population of British-born Australian residents. ; Queensland had 695,525 overseas-born residents, and attracted the greatest proportion of persons born in Papua New Guinea (52.4%) and in New Zealand (38.2%). , 30% of the Australian resident population, or 7,529,570 people, had been born overseas.

Competition was fierce among competing breweries' tied houses within cities. This system ended with the enactment of nationwide Prohibition in the United States in 1919. Although Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the states broad power to regulate the alcoholic beverage industry. Tied-house restrictions have been construed as forbidding virtually any form of vertical integration in the alcoholic beverage industry. As the Supreme Court of California \n\n Oregon Ballot Mesure 7 (1940) was an initiative proposed for the general election on the November 5, 1940, ballot to repeal the present liquor law, and allow private sales, with regulation and tax. The official ballot title states its intention as \"BILL REPEALING PRESENT LIQUOR LAW; AUTHORIZING PRIVATE SALE, LICENSED, TAXED.\" It was defeated with 309,183 no votes, to only 90,681 votes in favor. After the repeal of prohibition by the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 5, 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was established to regulate and control the sales and consumption of alcoholic liquor in Oregon. At the time, the law stated that: \"only the liquor control commission can import, purchase and sell alcoholic liquor containing over seventeen percent of alcohol, and that such liquor may not be \n\n S.J.Res. 211 was sent to the United States Secretary of State on February 20, 1933. On March 21, 1933, Congress enacted the Cullen-Harrison Act, which redefined \"intoxicating beverage\" as one with 3.2 percent alcohol by weight. The Cullen-Harrison Act went into effect on April 7, 1933. The 21st Amendment was ratified by state ratifying conventions on December 5, 1933.

Prior to national Prohibition, beginning in the late 19th century, many states and localities had enacted Prohibition within their jurisdictions. After the repeal of the 18th Amendment, some localities (known as dry counties) continue to ban the sale of alcohol, but often not possession or consumption. Between 1832 and 1953, US federal law prohibited the sale of alcohol to Native Americans. The federal legislation was repealed in 1953, and within a few years, most tribes passed their own prohibition laws. As of 2007, 63% of the federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states had legalized alcohol sales on their reservations.\n\n in a landmark 1971 decision: Following repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, the vast majority of states, including California, enacted alcoholic beverage control laws. These statutes sought to forestall the generation of such evils and excesses as intemperance and disorderly marketing conditions that had plagued the public and the alcoholic beverage industry prior to prohibition. . . By enacting prohibitions against \"tied-house\" arrangements, state legislatures aimed to prevent two particular dangers: the ability and potentiality of large firms to dominate local markets through vertical and horizontal integration. . . and the excessive sales of alcoholic beverages produced by the overly aggressive marketing \n\nQuestion: What was the last US state to reintroduce alcohol after prohibition?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive. A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels: $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively. Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of \n\n since 1954, the VTR cannot record color. ; 1957: The Frenchman Henri de France (1911–1986) developed the first generation of color TV system SECAM, which avoids some of the problems of the NTSC method.

The company Mercury Records launches the first stereo record on the market. ; The company Ampex expands the video recorder with the Model \"VR 1000 B\" to give it color capability. \n\n Mono was the playback medium for most record players, car radios, and transistor radios during the 1960s. Stereo playback systems had been available since the late 1950s, but the equipment and the albums mixed to play on them were expensive, and the music industry continued to manufacture mono albums and singles through the decade. Monophonic as a format would not be discontinued in both the United States and the United Kingdom until approximately 1969.

In the early sixties, Putnam scored a significant coup when major US record labels began to release stereophonic recordings in large numbers. According to Allen Sides, when stereo first appeared in the late 1950s, the cost-conscious major labels were initially uninterested, feeling that the market for the new format was limited, and that stereo mixdowns were a waste \n\nQuestion: In which decade did stereo records first go on sale?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It highlights his early experiences and their resulting impact on his private and professional life. As the son of the local blacksmith, Hogan learned from an early age the way metal could be forged to best accomplish specific tasks. He is thought to have used that knowledge to his advantage, later in life, as he went on to design and manufacture optimum golf equipment. \n\n William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 – July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his ball-striking ability. Hogan's nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (15) and Walter Hagen (11). He is one of only five players to have won all four majors: the Masters Tournament, The Open Championship (despite only playing once), the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship. The other four are Nicklaus, Woods, Player, and Gene Sarazen; Hogan's first major win came at age 34.\n\n Hogan is widely acknowledged to have been one of the finest ball strikers that ever played the game. Hogan's ball striking has also been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as Jack Nicklaus, who only saw him play some years after his prime. Nicklaus once responded to the question, \"Is Tiger Woods the best ball striker you have ever seen?\" with, \"No, no - Ben Hogan, easily\". Further testimony to Hogan's (and Moe Norman's) status among top golfers is provided by Tiger Woods, who said that he wished to \"own his (golf) swing\" in the same way as Moe Norman and \n\nQuestion: What was golfing great Ben Hogan's famous reply when he was asked how to improve one's game?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Twenty-four athletes from 17 nations competed. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. The event was won by Guy Drut of France, the sixth man to win two medals in the event (silver in 1972). It was France's first championship in the men's high hurdles, and only the third time the event was won by a hurdler not from the United States. Alejandro Casañas's silver gave Cuba its first medal in the event. Willie Davenport took bronze, becoming the seventh man to win a second medal and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games (he had won gold in 1968). It was the first time in Olympic history that the United States failed to win either gold or silver in the event; the Americans had won the last 9 straight editions of the event and 15 of 17 overall, with silver (and bronze) medals in the other two times (1920 and 1928).\n\n  The men's 200 metres competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom was held at the Olympic Stadium on 7–9 August. There were 54 competitors from 40 nations. The event was won by Usain Bolt of Jamaica, the first man to repeat as champion in the 200 metres. His teammates Yohan Blake (silver) and Warren Weir (bronze) completed the medal sweep; it was the seventh sweep in the men's 200 metres and the first by a nation other than the United States. Bolt's gold medal was Jamaica's third in the event, moving out of a tie with Canada and Italy for second-most overall (behind the United States' 17 wins). This was only the fourth time that the United States failed to win a medal in the men's 200 metres, Wallace Spearmon finishing fourth with a time of 19.90, 0.06 seconds outside of a medal placing (the others being the 1928 Olympics, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow which the country boycotted, and the 2000 Olympics).\n\n Brazil was the host nation of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having competed in all editions in the modern era from 1920 onwards, except the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Setting a milestone in Olympic history, Brazil became the first South American country to host the Summer Olympics, and the second Latin American host following the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. In this edition, Brazil beat both its previous highest number of gold medals obtained at one Olympics until this games (five gold medals in Athens 2004), and its record of total medals won at a Games (17 medals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012). Brazil won gold for the first time in two sports: boxing (Robson Conceição in men's lightweight) and football (men's team). It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). Brazil also won its first ever medals in canoeing sprint, the silver that Queiroz won in C1-1000 m was the first in that sport.\n\n The Netherlands was the host nation for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. 266 competitors, 222 men and 44 women, took part in 103 events in 17 sports.\n\n  The 1928 Winter Olympics, referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the II Olympic Winter Games, were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, from February 11 through February 18, 1928. A total of 464 athletes from 25 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games. Overall, 14 events were contested in 8 disciplines. Athletes competed in skeleton for the first time, but unlike the previous Olympic Games there was no curling competition and military patrol was a demonstration event rather than a medal event.

Unlike a boxing ring, the ring ropes in a wrestling ring are not tethered together. These ropes are held up and tensioned by turnbuckles, which, in turn, hang on steel ring posts, which also support the frame. The ends of the turnbuckles facing into the ring are padded, either individually, or with a large pad for all three similar to a boxing ring, as in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. A portion of the mat extends outside the ring ropes, known as the ring apron. The elevated sides of the ring \n\n The match takes place on a thick rubber circular mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a 1.5 meter border of the same thickness known as the \"protection area\". Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the \"red zone\". The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the \"passivity zone\". Inside the red zone is the \"central wrestling area\" which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the \n\n The field for the competition was a square measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, which could be constructed by teams for practising prior to competitions. In the centre of the field there is a vertically constructed set of pegs, which are arranged in a three-by-three grid (as a tic-tac-toe board). Along the edges of the field, there are other pegs, each of which contains a set of six red or blue rings, which can be harvested and scored by the corresponding alliance. The field is also divided into two triangular sides, one red and one blue.\n\n and medicine balls. Boxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately. Boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n  The configuration and construction of the traditional wrestling ring closely resembles that of a boxing ring. Like boxing rings, wrestling rings are also known by the poetic name of the \"squared circle\", which derives from how combative exhibitions would often be held in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. Wrestling rings are generally composed of an elevated steel beam and wood plank stage topped by foam padding and a canvas cover. Around the ring are three ring ropes, one fewer than modern boxing rings, which have had four ropes since the 1970s. The materials used for the ropes differ depending on the ring builder or promotion.

He won Amateur Athletic Union national titles, including five 20-kilometer titles, two 25-kilometer, two 30-kilometer and two national marathon championships between the years of 1944–54. In 1945, he ran the year's fastest marathon in the world. Robbins completed his 50th consecutive Manchester Road Race in 2001 and participated in 20 Boston Marathons. In April 1944 he finished third in 2:38:31 at Boston to four-time winner Canada's Gérard Côté and two-time champion (and seven-time runner up) John A. Kelley. Nine years later, he ran Boston in 2:43:56. On November 12, 1944, while in the U.S. Navy, he also won the U.S. national marathon championship at the Yonkers marathon, running 2:40.48.6. He was the alternate, in the event one of the three qualifiers was unable to run, to the 1948 London Olympic's marathon team. Remarkably, he often ran his races barefoot.\n\n When Sherm Miller, who worked for the St. George City Parks and Recreation Department, returned to St. George after running the Deseret News Marathon in Salt Lake City, he was inspired to host a marathon in St. George. Although others were not as enthusiastic about the idea, he was allowed to hold his marathon. He quickly organized the first St. George Marathon, held in November 1977. That first race began on a cold day with 57 runners and one wheelchair racer. The participants faced a strong headwind as they ran. Near mile 20, one runner was almost hit by a hay truck. Of the 58 who started the race, only 38 reached the finish line, a finish line on a course that was later \n\n The first marathon was perhaps a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. According to this belief, he dropped dead of exhaustion shorty after arriving in Athens. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. After around 40 years of various distances, the 42.195 kilometer (26.2) mile trek became standard. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. With an increase in popularity, the scientific field has a large basis to analyze some of the physiological characteristics and the factors influencing these traits that led to Pheidippides's death. The high physical and biochemical demands of marathon running and variation across finishing times make for an intricate field of study that entangles multiple facets of human capacities.\n\n The race was the idea of Tommy Leonard, an avid runner and popular bartender in Boston and Falmouth. During the 1972 Summer Olympics Leonard closed his bar in order to watch Frank Shorter win the first Olympic marathon for the United States since 1908. After Shorter won the marathon Leonard was quoted as saying \"Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get Frank Shorter to run in a race on Cape Cod?\" One year later, in the summer of 1973, with the help of a local high school track coach John Carroll, and the town's recreation director Rich Sherman, the first Falmouth Road Race was run by approximately 100 people. The next year there were 445 runners, and the year after that Frank Shorter joined 850 other runners in the race, bringing Leonard's wish true. Today the ASICS Falmouth Road Race is considered one of the premier non-marathon races in the country, if not the world, attracting over 10,000 runners each year. The field of runners typically includes many of the best American and international runners, including both past and future Olympic athletes.\n\n This was the third appearance of the marathon event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Arthur L. Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return, while other significant American runners included the winners of the past three Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and 1904 winner Michael Spring. Cuba and South Africa each made their first appearance in the event, while the United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first three Olympic marathons. The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who happened to be in St. Louis as part of the South African exhibit at the 1904 World's Fair. Both had served as long-distance message runners during the then-recent Boer War. Although some accounts report that both ran barefoot, Mashiani was shoed in photographs taken during the event.\n\nQuestion: In the very first Boston Marathon, 15 runners competed.

About 20 km from the city is Mount Kenya National Park. Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano lying astride the Equator. The mountain has two main snow-covered peaks – Batian (5 200 m) and Nelion (5 188 m). It is the highest mountain in the country and the second, after Kilimanjaro, in Africa. The mountain slopes are covered in forest, bamboo, scrub and moorland giving way on high central peaks to rock, ice and snow. Its U-shaped glacial valleys, rugged snow-capped peaks, Afro-alpine desert, thirty lakes and eight different natural forest types and a variety of wildlife species make it a convergence of natural attractions. The wildlife found in the park include giant forest hog, tree hyrax, white-tailed mongoose, black leopard, mountain bongo, elephant, black rhino, suni, black-fronted duiker, mole-rat and over 130 species of birds. Activities taking place in the park include game drives, nature walks, mountain climbing, wildlife viewing, camping and cave exploration.\n\n Mount Loolmalasin (sometimes spelled \"Loolmalassin\") is a mountain located in the Ngorongoro District of the Arusha Region, Tanzania. It has a peak elevation of 3682 m above sea level. It is, after Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru, the third-highest mountain in Tanzania if Kilimanjaro's three peaks are considered to be one mountain. Mount Loolmalasin is the second tallest mountain in Arusha Region and the tallest point in Ngorongoro District. The mountain also is the source of Simiyu River, which flows west to Lake Victoria in Simiyu Region.\n\n Furtwängler, who along with Ziegfried Koenig, were the fourth to ascend to the summit of Kilimanjaro in 1912.  At the summit, there is a sign posted by the Tanzanian government. The sign (printed in English only) reads \"Congratulations! You are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania, 5,895 m. AMSL. Africa's Highest Point. World's Highest Free-Standing Mountain.\" It formerly had a fourth part of the sign, which read, \"One of World's Largest Volcanos. Welcome.\" The sign is covered in travel stickers from past trekkers who have left their mark on the top of the peak. Near this sign is a box containing a log that many trekkers have signed.\n\n Mount Meru, the second highest mountain in Tanzania after Mount Kilimanjaro, peaks at 4655 m. Arusha Region has the highest number of craters and extinct volcanoes in Tanzania. Other prominent peaks and mountians include the Monduli Mountains, Mount Loolmalasin, Mount Lolkisale, Mount Longido, Gelai Volcano, and the Olduvai Gorge.\n\n In Africa a major trekking destination is Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano in Tanzania, which is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain in the world: 5895 m above sea level and about 4900 m above its plateau base.\n\nQuestion: Which volcano in Tanzania is the highest mountain in Africa?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa. Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology.

The color of the passport was green, representing Libya's past flag, and features the Hawk of Quraish in the middle.\n\n In the Gaddafi era the National team used to play its home matches wearing the green coloured kit representing the Flag of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. This change resulted in changing the national team's kit in order to represent the new flag. The team played its home matches with colours: Red, Black and Green (as in the flag). Red dominates the strip and is the sole jersey colour. The away colours were white in both eras. Since 2011, the LFF emblem and the national team's badge was changed into the current design. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. During late 2011 and early 2012 the Libyan team wore white jerseys temporarily in their qualification games and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. However, in mid-2012 the team began to use red jerseys. In 2014, Libya replaced the green socks worn by the players with black ones. Adidas is the supplier of the official team strip.\n\n Omar Faiek Shennib is credited for the design of the independence Flag of Libya: this flag represented Libya from its independence until 1951 to 1969, and which was re-adopted by the rebel movement during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. According to the memoirs of Adrian Pelt, UN commissioner for Libya (1949 to 1951), “during deliberations of the Libyan National Constitutional Convention, a paper drawing of a proposed national flag was presented to the convention by Omar Faiek Shennib (distinguished member of the delegation from Cyrenaica). The design was composed of three colors; red, black and green, with a white Crescent and Star centered in the middle black stripe. Mr. Shennib informed the delegates that this design had met the approval of His Highness Emir of Cyrenaica, King Idris Al Senussi (later to become King of Libya). The assembly subsequently approved that design.”.\n\n regions of Libya: Fezzan (red), Cyrenaica (black), and Tripolitania (green). Under Muammar Gaddafi's leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only flag in the world to have one color and no design. During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad.

It is also the country's largest city, with a population of 2,453,496 in 2019. The city's name is often shortened to Ouaga. The inhabitants are called ouagalais. The spelling of the name Ouagadougou is derived from the French orthography common in former French African colonies. Ouagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an international airport and is linked by rail to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and, for freight only, to Kaya. There are several highways linking the city to Niamey, Niger, south to Ghana, and southwest to Ivory Coast. Ouagadougou has one of West Africa's largest markets, which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the Moro-Naba Ceremony), the National Museum of Music, and several craft markets.\n\n Kouré is a rural community located 60 km east of Niamey, the capital of Niger. The town lies on both sides of the road from Niamey to Dallol Bosso. Kouré is best known for West African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), an endemic subspecies of West Africa. The population of giraffes in Niger reached a low of 50 animals 1984, but according to the Association to Safeguard Giraffes in Niger (ASGN) there are now 170 of them. ASGN and its partners have assisted the local community with bore holes, cereal banks, grain mills, seeds and fertilizer to encourage them to protect the giraffes, which can be destructive \n\n Niamey makes up a special capital district of Niger, which is surrounded by the Region of Tillabéri. The city of Niamey itself is governed as an autonomous first-level administrative block, the Niamey Urban Community (Fr. Communauté Urbaine de Niamey, or CUN). It includes five Urban Communes, divided into 44 \"Districts\" and 99 \"Quartiers\", including formerly independent towns. It is a co-equal first division subdivision with the seven Regions of Niger. The Niamey Urban Community includes an administration and Governor appointed by national leaders. Like the rest of Niger, Niamey has seen a decentralisation of governance since 2000. Government Ordinance n°2010–56 and Presidential Decree n°2010-679 of September 2010 mandated an elected City Council for the city of Niamey, subsumed under the CUN. This excludes some outlying areas of the CUN. Forty-five councillors are popularly \n\n  Niamey (Gare de Niamey), colloquially also known as Niamey Hippodrome, is the main railway station of the city of Niamey, the capital of Niger. Located near the Niamey Racecourse (Hippodrome de Niamey), in Niamey IV borough, is the first station opened in Niger and is part of AfricaRail project.\n\n Niamey is the capital and largest city of Niger. Niamey lies on the Niger River, primarily situated on the east bank. Niamey's population was counted as 1,026,848 as of the 2012 census. As of 2017, population projections show the capital district growing at a slower rate than the country as a whole, which has the world's highest fertility rate.

Universal Pictures had filmed the part-talkie Show Boat which was released in 1929. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal, had been deeply dissatisfied with that film, and wanted to make an all-sound version of the musical. It was originally scheduled to be made in 1934, but plans to make this version with Russ Columbo as the gambler Gaylord Ravenal fell through when Columbo was killed that year in a shotgun accident, and production of the film was rescheduled. The film, with several members of the original Broadway cast, began principal photography in late 1935 and was released in 1936. In addition to the songs retained from the stage production, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three additional songs for the film. Two of them were performed in spots previously reserved for songs from the stage production.\n\n A Dangerous Maid is a musical with a book by Charles W. Bell, music by George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin (writing under the pseudonym \"Arthur Francis\"). The script is based on Bell's 1918 play A Dislocated Honeymoon. The story concerns an ex-showgirl who elopes with a society boy, but his family tries to break up the marriage. The Gershwins wrote ten songs for the musical, eight of which were used in the production, which premiered in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on March 21, 1921. It toured through several cities and ended in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it closed on April 16, 1921. The show was George Gershwin's second book musical and his first \n\n \"You and the Night and the Music\" is a popular song composed by Arthur Schwartz with lyrics by Howard Dietz. The song was debuted in the Broadway show Revenge with Music. The show originally opened on November 28, 1934, ran for 22 performances, after which it closed. It then reopened on December 24, 1934, and ran for an additional 135 performances. Authors Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, in their book Song by Song: 14 Great Lyric Writers, say that “...the musical yielded two enduring hits and a profit although it was an artistic failure.”\n\n The musical contains the hit song \"Nellie Kelly, I Love You\", sung by Conroy, who also sings \"You Remind Me of My Mother\". Other songs include \"All in the Wearing\", \"Dancing My Worries Away\", \"Till My Luck Comes Rolling Along\", \"They're All My Boys\", \"The Voice in My Heart\", \"The Busy Bees of DeVere's\" and \"The Dancing Detective\". A song-book, including the music and lyrics of all the show's songs, was published in 1922 by M. Witmark & Sons of New York.\n\n Broadway musical Lew Leslie's International Revue, composed by Jimmy McHugh with lyrics by Dorothy Fields. Harry Richman sang it in the original revue. Although the musical was a flop, \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\" became instantly popular. Richman and Ted Lewis charted with it in 1930, and Louis Armstrong recorded his version in 1934. The song is readily associated with Armstrong today. Tommy Dorsey and Jo Stafford both brought the song to the charts in 1945.

After all, no one knew Stagecoach was going to be a masterpiece, let alone win two Oscars; up until then, no Western had ever been a masterpiece. It was also John Ford's first Western with sound. And Schoenberg and Stravinsky, not to mention Rachmaninoff, were all in a three-mile radius. But that is just a guess.

One of those was Richard Hageman, the Philadelphia Orchestra notwithstanding.\"\n\n The supporting cast includes Brian Donlevy, George Sanders and Chill Wills. Claire Trevor and John Wayne also headed the cast of John Ford's Stagecoach the same year, and in both films as well as Dark Command the following year, Trevor is top-billed over Wayne due to her greater name value at the time. The film did not fare well in its initial release. The superficially similar John Ford film Drums Along the Mohawk had been released only one week prior.

The band changed tack with the advent of punk in 1977 and Finney and Perrin recruited a new line-up of Pip Nicholls (bass), Adrian Wright (guitar), and Alec Sidebottom (drums, formerly of The Purple Gang), now mixing punk rock with sixties influences. They shared bills with the likes of Buzzcocks, Magazine and Joy Division, and their debut EP, You're Not Going Out Dressed Like That, released in 1979, led to a deal with Factory Records, who released the follow-up, Time Goes By So \n\n \"Speak to Me\" is the first track on British progressive rock band Pink Floyd's 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, on which it forms an overture. Nick Mason receives a rare solo writing credit for the track, though recollections differ as to the reasons for this.

Four years later, the Soviet Union and 14 of its allies then boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics, \n\n  For the 1984 Summer Olympics, a total of thirty-one venues were used. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl, two venues previously used for the 1932 Summer Olympics, were used for the 1984 Games. Between the 1932 and the 1984 Summer Olympics, the expansion of professional sports teams assisted in the growth of the facilities that would be used for the 1984 events. Only two new permanent venues were constructed, both using corporate sponsorship, though neither were mentioned in the official Olympic report. Many other venues had temporary adjustments and returned to their normal usage once the 1984 Olympics were completed.

The six-part series aired every two weeks on Cinemax between July 1987 and October 1987, the last two episodes coinciding with the first two of the second season of the sci-fi show. Unlike previous Cinemax episodes of Max, these six were not broadcast in the UK. Two weeks after this Cinemax series ended, the ABC show was cancelled. Max Headroom disappeared from the airwaves. His only further appearances were a couple of leftover ABC episodes broadcast as timeslot-fillers in the spring of 1988, a cameo on Sesame Street around the same time, and another cameo on a Comic Relief program in the spring of 1989.\n\n Max Rep: Mr. Astrotitan 2206 and Max Rep in the Age of Astrotitans were comic strips appearing originally in FLEX in the late 1980s, and then in Muscular Development magazine throughout the 90's, and a Comic Book published by Dumbbell Press and created by illustrator Lyman Dally after the strip's cancellation which was initiated by Dally over creative differences.

The musical, with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, was based on the stories of Sholem Aleichem.   Actor Zero Mostel starred in the lead role of Tevye, father of five daughters.  Before opening on Broadway, the play had been perfected during the summer in performances in Detroit and in Washington, D.C..  The final performance of the original production would take place on July 2, 1972. ; The Coyote Canyon Fire broke out near Santa Barbara, California, after being initially caused \n\n how wealth would allow him to spend less time working and more time praying and studying the Torah, and finally asking God if \"it would spoil a vast eternal plan\" if he were wealthy. A repeated phrase throughout the song, \"all day long I'd bidi-bidi-bum,\" is often misunderstood to refer to Tevye's desire not to have to work. However, in an interview with Terry Gross, Sheldon Harnick said he basically made up syllables that he thought would give the effect of Chassidic chanting. The first person to play Tevye, Zero Mostel, then replaced the syllables Harnick had written with ones that Mostel thought would be more authentic.\n\n The Oxford Companion to the American Musical wrote that the song includes passages of \"cantor-like chanting\", and is \"the most revealing of the many character numbers\". The Broadway Musical: A Critical and Musical Survey explained that the song contains a greater number of Jewish \"commonplaces\" than any other number in the score, and added the song does twofold: it \"offers such a strong dose of idiom early in the show [which] is good for the overall unity\", and the \"important dramatic function\" of introducing the central character of Tevye through song. History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe explains that the song is based on a monologue from the stories of Sholem Aleichem entitled \"If I were Rothschild\", in reference to the wealthy Jewish banking family. The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase \"if I were a rich man\" to the Cowardly Lion's \"if I were king of the forest\" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine. It has been suggested that song is inspired by a Hasidic folk song.\n\n a great commercial success, running 964 performances and conferring star status on Mostel (he also won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for this role). A film version was produced in 1966, also starring Mostel – and Silvers. On September 22, 1964, Mostel opened as Tevye in the original Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof. Because of Mostel's respect for the works of Sholem Aleichem he insisted that more of the author's mood and style be incorporated into the musical, and he made major contributions to its shape. He also created the cantorial sounds made famous in the song \"If I Were a Rich Man\". The New York Times \n\n \"If I Were a Rich Man\" is a show tune from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. It was written by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock. The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The title is inspired by a 1902 monologue by Sholem Aleichem in Yiddish, Ven ikh bin Rothschild (If I were a Rothschild), a reference to the wealth of the Rothschild family, although the content is quite different. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story \"The Bubble Bursts.\" Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye's Daughters.\n\nQuestion: If I Were A Rich Man Was a big hit from which stage show?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The family finds a hidden cache of food and they land safely on a nearby island. After finding shelter they set out to explore the island. They soon find that everything they need seems to grow on trees. They explore, hunt wild boar, and construct a signal flag to attract passing ships. During a tremendous storm, an emigrant ship is wrecked on the coral reef just off the island. Otto and Dominick Rigonda run to aid the passengers.

The island's only inhabitants are the overseer of the abandoned plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. Discipline is represented by a former warrant officer but ends when he suffers a catastrophic loss of face. Soon, discipline and rationality are replaced by a struggle for power and the woman. Power is represented by a pair of pistols found in the wreckage of an American airplane, so important that five men pay for their lives in a bid for supremacy.\n\nThe Hurricane (1937) directed by John Ford, was based on the novel of the same name. It was re-made in 1979. ; The Tuttles of Tahiti (1942) with Charles Laughton, was based on the novel No More Gas. ; Passage to Marseille (1944) directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Humphrey Bogart, was based on Men Without Country. ; High Barbaree (1947) with Van Johnson and June Allyson was based on the novel of the same name. ; Botany Bay (1953) with Alan Ladd and James Mason, was adapted from the novel of the same name. The Nordhoff–Hall books were the source for both the 1935 and the 1962 MGM films, Mutiny on the Bounty. The 1984 film, The Bounty, was based on other sources, more well-researched views of the actual events of 1789 in which the mutiny results not from maltreatment by Captain Bligh but from the lure of South Pacific life for the ship's crew. In addition to the Bounty story, five other books by Nordhoff, all of them collaborations with James Norman Hall, were turned into films. (The screenplays were all written by other writers). \n\n The novel on which the film is based is a sequel to two other novels by Jules Verne, In Search of the Castaways (1867) and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870). The first book featured the island, the pirates and a character Tom Ayrton who was marooned on a nearby island. The second book featured Captain Nemo and the Nautilus presumed lost in the maelstrom at the end of that novel. In The Mysterious Island (1874) after the escapees' balloon landed on the island, among many adventures, they encountered Ayrton alive, fought the pirates and discovered that Captain Nemo was their benefactor and the island the base for the Nautilus.\n\nWilton Powers in The Mutiny of the Bounty (1916) ; Errol Flynn in In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) ; Clark Gable in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) ; Marlon Brando in Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) ; Mel Gibson in The Bounty (1984) Christian was portrayed in films by: The 1935 and 1962 films are based on the 1932 novel Mutiny on the Bounty in which Christian is a major character and is generally portrayed positively. The authors of that novel, Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, also wrote two sequels, one of which, Pitcairn's Island, is the story of the tragic events after the mutiny that apparently resulted in Christian's death along with other violent deaths on Pitcairn Island. (The other sequel, Men Against the Sea, is the story of Bligh's voyage after the mutiny.) This series of novels uses fictionalised versions of minor crew members as narrators of the stories.

In particular, the book seemed to slur the character of Anne Sullivan's husband, writer-publicist John Macy, who was close to Keller's age. A relationship between Macy and Keller has long been a subject of speculation. Esther's reporter friend was reminiscent of Keller's highly publicised attempt to elope with reporter-secretary Peter Fagan. The novel focuses mainly on the falsehoods behind large-scale charities and the self-serving natures of those involved.

He was born in Nuremberg in 1502 and it is suggested that he studied in the workshop of Dürer, which had significant influences on his artwork and decisions made in his career. The premise of this woodcut is based on a passage from the Bible, John 10:1-42. This passage articulates Christ as the shepherd, his followers as the flock, and all others as thieves. \"All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking. Other critics of the movement assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible. Televangelists are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations. Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately \n\n Some scholars of the Peshitta and the Greek New Testament claim that in Matthew 19:24 as the Aramaic word for 'camel' is written identically to the word for 'rope.' an error occurred due to the translator's limitations when the original scrolls were being transferred into Greek. This would mean Matthew 19:24 commonly translated as, 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.' Would read 'rope' instead of 'camel'. To support this they claim that rope, is much more in keeping with the imagery of a needle, and that it is probably what Jesus said, and what was originally recorded. Saint Cyril in his commentary on the Holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 18:25) says that camel is the term used by those versed in navigation for a thick rope, thereby both stating that the term camel is the right one and that its meaning is that of a rope and not the animal. This suggests the Lamsa 'rope' translation is the more accurate \"meaning\" translation and 'camel' is the more accurate 1st century \"slang\" translation.\n\n him, see also Evangelical counsels. The man cannot comply and he goes away sad. Jesus tells everyone that \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" (25) This is a radical teaching, then and now, as most people naturally believe riches, especially their own, are a sign of God's favor. Some argue that this does not mean that no rich person can enter heaven, but that the rich must humble themselves in order to achieve salvation. There is, however, debate about this among Christians. The disciples (students) then wonder aloud if any person can fully keep Jesus' commandments.

Capote completed The Grass Harp while he was vacationing in Taormina, Sicily. The last section was airmailed to the publishers Random House just days after he finished writing it, but it was not published for four months because the editors, specifically Bob Linscott, did not care for the ending of the novel. Linscott thought that the ending was weak because, once the characters were up in the tree house, Capote \"didn't know what to do with them.\" He asked Capote to rewrite the ending, and Capote made some changes in it, but he did not completely rewrite it. Truman Capote initially wanted to title the novel Music of the Sawgrass. It was Bob Linscott who gave it the title The Grass Harp.\n\n Truman Capote began writing the manuscript for Other Voices, Other Rooms after being inspired by a walk in the woods while he was living in Monroeville, Alabama. He immediately cast aside his rough manuscript for Summer Crossing and took up writing Other Voices, Other Rooms. After leaving Alabama, he continued to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Louisiana. His budding literary fame put him in touch with fellow southerner and writer Carson McCullers. Capote joined McCullers at the artists' community, Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, New York, to continue working on his novel. As friends, McCullers helped Capote locate an agent and a publisher (Marion Ives and Random House) for Other Voices, Other Rooms. Capote continued to work on the novel in North Carolina and eventually completed it in a rented cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Truman Capote took two years to write Other Voices, Other Rooms.\n\n Truman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. He was at the height of his popularity as an author and as a public figure following the publication of his non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, earlier that year. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society. According to Capote's friend, the writer and editor Leo Lerman, Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony Yaddo that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend. Capote's friend, author Dominick Dunne, had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary. Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching In Cold Blood. Capote was also inspired by the \"Ascot scene\" from the film My Fair Lady in which the women were all dressed in black and white.\n\n Not wanting to take up his incomplete first novel, Summer Crossing, Capote began writing The Grass Harp in June 1950 and completed it on May 27, 1951. The novel was inspired by memories of his Alabama childhood, specifically a tree house constructed in the 1930s in a large walnut tree in his cousin Jenny's backyard. This large tree house, accessible by an antique spiral staircase, featured cypress wood construction and a tin roof, and was furnished with a rattan sofa. Capote spent time in this tree house with his cousin Sook or other childhood friends such as Nelle Harper Lee. The novel was additionally inspired by his cousin Sook's dropsy medicine, which she made yearly until the age of 62. She took the recipe for it to the grave, despite Jenny's wanting first \n\n Capote died in 1984 and his will established a lifetime annuity for his companion, Jack Dunphy. It further stipulated that, on Dunphy's death, a literary trust be created that would be sustained by the royalties from Capote's books. Dunphy died in 1992, and the trust was finally established in 1994. The trust is located in Los Angeles.\n\nQuestion: What was Truman Capote's last name before he was adopted by his stepfather?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Frick had been responsible for crushing the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Strike, in which nine union workers and seven guards were killed. However, although Berkman shot Frick two times -Berkman was subdued before the third shot- and stabbed him several times in the leg with a poisoned knife, Frick survived, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Berkman had hoped to awaken the consciousness of the oppressed American people—an attentat—but, as the book goes on to \n\n King wrote a few parts of a story by the same name and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of Christmas cards, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. Philtrum Press produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items. In 2000, King published the novella Riding the Bullet over the Internet, making it the world's first mass market e-book. However, there were technical problems with downloading, and hackers eventually cracked the encryption. Later that year, King released The Plant directly via his website, unencrypted and in installments. People could pay a $1 fee for each installment using the honor system. King said, however, that he would drop the project if the percentage of paying readers fell below 75 percent. He viewed the release as an experiment in alternate forms of \n\n to destroy their faith. The novel also addresses larger questions about the war and about Korean Christianity, about the juxtaposition between the large-scale suffering of the public during wartime and the individual aspects of faith, hope, confession, etc. Although the story is built around the twelve murdered ministers, Kim returns to the suffering of the innocent Koreans as a whole, thus implicitly posing the question of whether the people of Korea are just as much \"martyrs\" as the twelve murdered men. The novel was immensely popular, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for twenty weeks and being translated into ten languages. It was a nominee for the National Book Award and for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n This is a list of adult fiction books that topped The New York Times Fiction Best Seller list in 1948. The American publisher Bennett Cerf noted that there had been \"only three novels published [in 1948] that were worth reading ... Cry, The Beloved Country, The Ides of March, and The Naked and the Dead.\" Only Cry did not top the list that year. A total of ten other novels did, however, with most titles spending only a few weeks at the top. The strongest performing title was The Naked and the Dead, Norman Mailer's first best seller, published when he was just 25 years old, which spent 19 weeks at Number 1 and more than 6 months in the top 10. It was the first \"big\" novel about World War II, based on his own experiences. The Ides of March was by Thornton Wilder and it spent 2 weeks at Number 1 but only 13 weeks in the top 15. The year ended with The Big Fisherman heading the list, Lloyd C. Douglas's follow-up to his huge 1942 best seller, The Robe.\n\nThe Armies of the Night (1968), Norman Mailer's Pulitzer Prize-winner and perhaps the most critically appreciated non-fiction novel, is a narrative which is split into a history and a novel, and which autobiographically recounts the 1967 March on the Pentagon in the third person.

The play has strong autobiographical elements, featuring characters based on its author, his histrionic mother, and his mentally fragile sister. In writing the play, Williams drew on an earlier short story, as well as a screenplay he had written under the title of The Gentleman Caller. The play premiered in Chicago in 1944. After a shaky start, it was championed by Chicago critics Ashton Stevens and Claudia Cassidy, whose enthusiasm helped build audiences so the producers could move the play to Broadway where it won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award in 1945. The Glass Menagerie was Williams' first successful play; he went on to become one of America's most highly regarded playwrights.\n\n Percy Garnett Williams was born on May 4, 1857, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the son of John B. Williams, a doctor and editor of the Baltimore Family Journal. Percy Williams was expected to also become a doctor, and after graduating from Baltimore College he studied medicine for a while. However, he was fascinated with theater. He organized and became the manager of the Courtland Dramatic Club. He played at the Front Street Theatre and Colonel Sinn's Theatre in Baltimore, then moved to Brooklyn in 1875, where he performed with Colonel Sinn's Park Theatre. He spent two seasons in Brooklyn, then returned to Baltimore and was the leading comedian in the Holliday Street Theater stock company. He performed in a traveling production of Uncle Tom's Cabin \n\n Dexter was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England. As a teenager, he was an early member of the Central Junior Television Workshop which led to various TV roles before he moved from Nottingham to London to attend RADA. After graduating in 1995, Dexter's early successes were on stage, in particular with two high-profile productions of Tennessee Williams plays, beginning with Sam Mendes's 1995 Olivier Award-winning production of The Glass Menagerie at the Donmar Warehouse, in which he played Jim O'Connor. This was soon followed by Trevor Nunn's Tony Award-winning production of Williams's never-before-seen Not About Nightingales, which transferred from London's National Theatre to the Circle in the Square Theatre \n\n Williams was born at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 12, 1935 to Henry, Sr. and Beatrice (née Henderson) Williams. The family lived in the 2nd Ward of New Orleans at 2522 Howard Avenue according to the 1940 U.S. Census. Henry, Sr. was listed as a construction laborer with the Works Progress Administration. Charles Williams was the second son in the family that included siblings Henry Jr., Clifford, Lloyd, and Mary Alice. He said his mother sang a lot because she was church-going, and his father liked to dance. Henry, Jr. played guitar and younger brother Lloyd played drums. Williams reported that \"ever since I been big enough to know myself I used to be always beating on something, tin cans or something like that.\"\n\n Williams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1883. His father was born in England but raised from the age of 5 in the Dominican Republic; his mother was from Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and had French extraction. Scholars note that the Caribbean culture of the family home had an important influence on Williams. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes, \"English was not his primary means of communication until he was a teenager. At home his mother and father—who were raised in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, respectively—spoke Spanish with each other and to young William Carlos.” While he wrote in English, \"the \n\nQuestion: In what state was playwright Tennessee Williams born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Hittites worshiped sacred stones called Huwasi stones. In the Hebrew Bible, Bethel (meaning \"House of God\"), is where Jacob had his vision of Jacob's ladder. Coming upon the place at nightfall, the Book of Genesis tells the reader that he laid his head on a stone, and had the vision while sleeping, then: 16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” 17 He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”  \n\n feud between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood. However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and tried to knock the wind out of him with the butt of his spear. However, probably by intervention of God, it went through Asahel. The Bible says everyone stopped and looked. That shows that something like \n\n desolate'. [R. Joshua] arose and came back and found himself in a certain inn where they paid him great respect. He said: 'How beautiful is this 'aksania'! Yeshu said to him, 'My master, her eyes are narrow!' He replied to him, 'Wicked person! Is it with such thoughts that thou occupiest thyself!' He sent forth four hundred horns and excommunicated him. [The disciple] came before him on many occasions, saying'Receive me'; but he refused to notice him. One day while [R. Joshua] was reciting the Shema', he came before him. His intention was to receive him and he made a sign to him with his hand, but the disciple thought he was repelling \n\n fight for our lives and our laws. He himself will crush them before us; as for you, do not be afraid of them.' When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were crushed before him. They pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon to the plain; eight hundred of them fell, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines. Then Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and terror fell on the Gentiles all around them.

Inferior mirage is the most common mirage in the deserts. When the Israelites went from a hot desert to a hail-covered desert to fight the Amorites, the inversion layers could have created a mock mirage of the setting sun. To the Israelites, the sun would then have appeared to stand still.

Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge ... As I looked, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. The Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom It is not explicit or clear who was seated on the thrones. \"The natural construction is that 'judges' sat on them.

Belshazzar, king of Babylon, holds a great feast, during which a hand appears and writes on the wall: \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN\". Daniel interprets the words: Belshazzar has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom is to be divided between the Medes and Persians. The story concludes: \"That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\" In the story of Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6), Daniel has continued to serve at the royal court under Darius, and has been raised to high office. His jealous rivals plot his downfall, tricking Darius into issuing a decree that no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but to Darius himself, \n\n of Kings: O King, live for ever... And in that same hour, as they feasted Came forth fingers of a man's hand And the King saw The part of the hand that wrote. And this was the writing that was written: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN' 'THOU ART WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AND FOUND WANTING'. In that night was Belshazzar the King slain And his Kingdom divided. Then sing aloud to God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Take a psalm, bring hither the timbrel, Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, Blow up the trumpet in Zion \n\n Belshazzar and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a hand mysteriously appears and writes upon the wall. The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids him for his lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar's kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians. Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to be third in the kingdom, and that very night Belshazzar is slain and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom.\n\n The fourth biblical mention is during Belshazzar's Feast in Daniel 5, when scripture reports 'fingers of a man's hand' wrote on the wall:  Daniel reads the words \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN\" and interprets them for the king: \"MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed ... and found wanting;\" and \"PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made… that he should rank third in the kingdom; [and] that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\" The phrase handwriting on the wall has entered our lexicon from this reference to mean a warning of impending doom.\n\nQuestion: In the Bible, who saw the handwriting on the wall?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was formally accepted by the Marine Corps on March 27, 1927, and renamed Jiggs II. At the time of his donation, Jiggs II was 17 months old, stood 15 inch high, and weighed 47 lbs.

The move to the Hearst Corporation chain exposed the strip to a multitude of new readers across the United States. In 1911, Nestor Studios of New Jersey acquired the right to make Mutt and Jeff short film comedies, after which Fisher decided he could make more money controlling film production himself. In 1913, he created the Bud Fisher Film Corporation and signed a deal with American Pathé. They made 36 Mutt and Jeff short comedies in 1913, but production ceased for two years when Fisher's copyright was challenged. Once the courts upheld Fisher's copyright claim, the comic strip was syndicated nationwide, and \n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated boxing matches of all time, the first African-American challenger for the World Heavyweight Championship of boxing, Jack Johnson defeated the man whom writer Jack London described as \"the chosen representative of the white race, and this time the greatest of them\", taking the crown from heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries in the fifteenth round of their bout in Reno, Nevada.

Unlike many boxers, McLarnin invested his money wisely and retired a wealthy man. He opened an electrical goods store, and also did some acting, golfing, and lecturing. In 1937, he appeared with boxers Maxie Rosenbloom, James J. Jeffries, Jack Dempsey, and Jackie Fields, in MGM's Big City, a film involving rough competition between two rival taxi companies. In 1938, he appeared in a background gymnasium scene for the successful 1938, MGM boxing movie, The Crowd Roars with boxers Abe \"The Newsboy\" Hollandersky, Joe Glick, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jack Roper, and Tommy Herman. In 1946, he appeared in Monogram Pictures' boxing movie, Joe Palooka, Champ, with cameos by real boxing greats Joe Louis, Henry Armstrong, Ceferino Garcia, and Manuel Ortiz.

The choice of Ford to fill the vacant vice-presidency was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. \"In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word,\" said Martha Griffiths. The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought. In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Other pieces of the everyman image were attributed to his inevitable comparison with Nixon, his Midwestern stodginess and his self-deprecation.\n\n young son was referred to as Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. from then on; the name change was formalized on December 3, 1935. He was raised in Grand Rapids with his three half-brothers from his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner \"Tom\" Ford (1918–1995), Richard Addison \"Dick\" Ford (1924–2015), and James Francis \"Jim\" Ford (1927–2001). Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. He is the only Eagle Scout to have ascended to the U.S. presidency. Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School, where he was a star athlete and captain of the football team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the Grand Rapids City League. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.\n\nA 41-cent Gerald Ford memorial commemorative stamp was issued on August 31, 2007, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Palm Springs, California. The stamp featured a portrait of Ford painted by Michael J. Deas. Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was the 38th president of the United States, serving from 1974 to 1977, and the 40th vice president of the United States serving from 1973 to 1974. Ford was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment, filling the vacancy left by Spiro Agnew's resignation. He became president upon Richard Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974.\n\n Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.) was born on July 14, 1913. Ford served nearly 25 years as a Representative of Michigan's 5th congressional district, eight of them as the Republican Minority Leader. Serving from 1973 to 1974 as the 40th Vice President of the United States, Ford was the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment. He then became President upon Richard Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, and served until January 20, 1977 as the 38th President of the United States.

It was performed on the film's soundtrack by The Mike Curb Congregation. Released as a single to promote the soundtrack album, the song was a minor hit, reaching #16 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. It was subsequently covered by numerous artists, including Sammy Davis Jr., Jack Jones, Bobby Sherman, Sarah Vaughan, and Australian pop singer Dave Allenby. In 1977, the song was performed by Muppet gingerbread men on Episode #201 of The Muppet Show. The film's opening theme song, \"Nobody Knows\", also composed by Legrand/ Bergman/ Bergman and performed in the film by Richie Havens, has also been covered a number of times, including by Natalie Cole, Lena Horne, Jack Jones, Kiri Te Kanawa, and Bill Medley.

Fitz-Hume watches Ronald Reagan singing \"I'll Be Loving You\" from the musical She's Working Her Way Through College early in the film. \n\n Shrek is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the Shrek series) to have Harry Gregson-Williams team up with John Powell to compose the score following Antz (1998) and Chicken Run (2000). Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Gregson-Williams due to a conflict. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering. Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used pop music and other Oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like \"On the Road Again\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" were integrated in the film's score.

Like Watership Down, The Hobbit, and even Robert Altman's live action, Harry Nilsson-scored Popeye, this hard to find soundtrack is a gem from another age.\" Kyle Anderson of the website Nerdist wrote that Jimmy Webb and America were among the \"many great people [who] were involved\" with the 1982 film, and that the album's \"songs work pretty well\".\n\n The music and score for the film was composed by Marc Shaiman, with song lyrics written by Scott Wittman and Shaiman.

Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing \"Mrs. Robinson\", Simon originally toyed with the title \"Mrs. Roosevelt\". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, \"Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here!

It also includes the acoustic version of Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence\", taken from the duo's 1964 debut, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. It was released in 1993 on Columbia Records. The track \"The Breakup\" is a mock-up news flash of Art Garfunkel giving a serious philosophical reason for the duo's break-up, with Simon continuously interrupting him, in an effort, as Garfunkel put it, \"To be like Nichols and May...Hoping people won't take the break-up of Simon and Garfunkel seriously.\"\n\n Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and actor whose career has spanned six decades.

He began performing with his schoolfriend Art Garfunkel in 1956 when they were still in their early teens. After limited success, the pair reunited after an electrified version of their song \"The Sound of Silence\" became a hit in 1966.

In 1982 a Four Power Agreement was reached, which included a statement from the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Richard von Weizsäcker, that Spandau Prison should be demolished as quickly as possible after the death of its lone inmate Rudolf Hess. Five weeks after the death of Hess on 17 August 1987 at 1610 hours, the demolition of Spandau Prison began and was completed on 4 November 1987. In May 1988 the construction of the new facility started and was finished on 18 September 1990. The name Britannia Centre was chosen by competition from over 40 entries.

Director Nathan Juran oversaw Tumbleweed, as well as Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River. As Murphy's film career began to progress, so did his efforts to improve his skills. He continually practiced his fast draw with a gun. When Hugh O'Brian bet $500 that he could draw a gun faster than anyone in Hollywood, Murphy raised the ante to $2500 and wanted to use live ammunition; O'Brian did not accept. He took both private and classroom acting lessons from Estelle Harman, and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.\n\n was not as well received as 48 Hrs., Trading Places, and Beverly Hills Cop. The Golden Child was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the supernatural setting as opposed to the \"street smart\" settings of his previous efforts. Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the Tony Scott-directed Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). It was a box-office success, grossing almost $300 million worldwide. By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood's biggest box office star. In 1988, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises company had struck a deal with CBS.\n\n Murphy reneged on the deal and the film was never made. Kazear sued Murphy in 1958. The 1950s ended with Murphy appearing in three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. Murphy's collaboration with Walter Mirisch on Cast a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No Name on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his \n\n From 1989 onwards, critical praise for Murphy's films declined, hitting a low point with the critically-panned Beverly Hills Cop III (1994), a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on Inside the Actors Studio. Box-office receipts also declined compared to his previous films, although he did find box office success with Another 48 Hrs. (1990) and Boomerang (1992). On Harlem Nights (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, Charlie Murphy. The film featured Murphy's comic idols Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in supporting roles. During this period, Murphy was criticized by filmmaker Spike Lee for not using his status to help black actors break into film, although as Murphy's prominence increased, his films (especially those he produced) often had \n\n in the 1950s, and Marion Hargrove was hired to write the script.

He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring his wife Wanda Hendrix, and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James. He and director Budd Boetticher become acquainted through Terry Hunt's Athletic Club where Murphy would request to be his boxing partner.

One day, he catches sight of a remote island and jumps ship, swimming to the island. The island is under the crude rule of a top-hatted black despot who receives merchandise from Smithers, the colonial merchant who is the sole white person on the island. Jones rises to become Smithers' partner and eventually \"Emperor.\" He dethrones his predecessor with a trick that allows him to survive what appears to be a fusillade of bullets, creating the myth that he can only be slain by a silver bullet. Jones's rule over the island involves increasing taxes on the poor natives and pocketing the proceeds. Jones, hunted by natives in revolt, flees through the jungle and slowly disintegrates psychologically. Hysterical, he runs into the path of his pursuers.\n\n Son of the Stars is a science fiction novel by American writer by Raymond F. Jones, first published in the United States in 1952 by The John C. Winston Company. This is one of the thirty-five juvenile novels that comprise the Winston Science Fiction set, which novels were published in the 1950s for a readership of teen-aged boys. The typical protagonist in these books was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers. In this story Ron Barron is typical in having a ham radio set up in a shed in the back yard of his parents' house.\n\n Rising Sun is a 1992 novel by Michael Crichton. It was his eighth under his own name and eighteenth overall, and is about a murder in the Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a fictional Japanese corporation. The book was published by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. An image of fashion model Gia Carangi is incorporated in the cover art for the original edition. Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture.\n\n Ballard's papers at the British Library include his screenplay (1972) for Concrete Island (Add MS 88938/3/9). In an episode entitled The Island from the cartoon show CatDog both characters are stuck in a dilemma identical to the protagonist in Concrete Island. In 2011, Barcelona-based production company Filmax announced that it was producing a film adaptation of the novel. Scott Kosar was set to adapt Ballard's story, and Brad Anderson was to direct. Actor Christian Bale was announced as the main character. A start date has yet to be announced. Bale, who played the lead in Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Ballard's Empire of the Sun, apparently is no longer attached to the project. In June 2013, BBC Radio 4 aired an hour-long adaptation by Graham White, directed by Mary Peate, featuring Andrew Scott as Maitland, Georgia Groome as Jane and Ben Crowe as Proctor.\n\n Empire of the Sun is a 1987 American epic coming-of-age war film based on J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical 1984 novel of the same name. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers. The film tells the story of Jamie \"Jim\" Graham, a young boy who goes from living in a wealthy British family in Shanghai, to becoming a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp, during World War II. Harold Becker and David Lean were originally to direct before Spielberg came on board, initially as a producer for Lean. Spielberg was attracted to directing the film because of a personal connection to Lean's films and World War II topics. He considers it to be his most profound work on \"the loss of innocence\". The film received positive reviews but was not initially a box office success, earning only $22,238,696 at the US box office, but it eventually more than recouped its budget through revenues in other markets.\n\nQuestion: In the 80s who wrote the novel Empire of The Sun?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is also referred to as Oitakenou Airfield and is classified as a General or Other Airport within Japan.\n\n Chofu Airport in the city of Chōfu in western Tokyo handles commuter flights to the Izu Islands, which are administratively part of Tokyo. Tokyo Heliport in Kōtō serves public-safety and news traffic. In the Izu Islands, Ōshima Airport on Ōshima, Hachijōjima Airport on Hachijō, and Miyakejima Airport on Miyake provide air services. Ibaraki Airport, located 85 km north of Tokyo, was positioning itself as a hub for low-cost carriers, flights from here to Sapporo seem to be the most popular. Shizuoka Airport, 175 km southwest of Tokyo, aims to be a more convenient alternative for Shizuoka residents than airports in Tokyo or Nagoya, however none of the above airports have shown to take away any significant traffic from Narita or Haneda and continue to play minor roles.\n\n and provide access to other major cities in Japan, such as Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo. Regular bus services are provided by Osaka City Bus, as well Hankyu, Hanshin and Kintetsu, providing a dense network covering most parts of the city. Osaka is served by two airports situated just outside of the city, Kansai International Airport (IATA: KIX) which handles primarily international passenger flights and Osaka International Airport (IATA:ITM) which handles mostly domestic services and some international cargo flights. Due to its geographical position, Osaka's international ferry connections are far greater than that of Tokyo, with international service to Shanghai, Tianjin, Korea along with domestic routes to Kitakyushu, Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Okinawa.\n\n Telephone West Corporation; Panasonic Corporation; Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc.; Rengo Co., Ltd.; The Senshu Ikeda Bank, Ltd.; Kiyo Holdings, Inc.; The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd.; The Shiga Bank，Ltd.; The Nanto Bank, Ltd.; Nippon Life Insurance Company; Mizuho Bank, Ltd.; Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Ltd.; MUFG Bank, Ltd.; Resona Bank, Ltd.; and the Private Finance Initiative Promotion Corporation of Japan. Kansai Airports is currently operating three airports in Japan, Kansai International Airport, Osaka International Airport and Kobe Airport. The operation rights of Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport were transferred to Kansai Airports from New Kansai International Airport Co., Ltd.

On the 1st of April 2018, Kansai Airports Kobe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kansai Airports, took over the operation of Kobe Airport from Kobe City.\n\n The airport opened in 1972, replacing a former Imperial Japanese Navy airfield in the Kamoike area near the city center, which had served as the city's main airport since 1957. The site of the former airport was re-developed as a \"new town\" with office buildings and high-density housing projects, and is now the site of the Kagoshima Prefecture government office, among other buildings. The airport's runway had an initial length of 2,500 m, which was extended to 3,000 m in 1980. An international terminal opened in 1982 and a cargo terminal opened in 1987. Air Niugini, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines and Nauru Airlines provided international service to Kagoshima from the 1970s to the 1980s, and JAL operated a route to Singapore via Hong Kong and Bangkok during the 1980s.

The Lion Bridge is in the Admiralteysky District of St. Petersburg, connecting the Kazansky and Spassky Islands. Its abutments are crowned with four cast-iron sculptures of lions, which give the bridge its name. The structure, suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of lions, was constructed in 1825 according to the design of two well-established bridge builders, Tratter and Kristianovich. It is an outstanding monument of bridge-building architecture of the first quarter of the 19th century [5]. It is also one of the three surviving pedestrian chain bridges in St. Petersburg (along with Bank and Pochtamtsky bridges).\n\n Prospect Point is a point at the northern tip of Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located on the south side of the First Narrows of Burrard Inlet. The point, which as its name suggests, is a viewpoint, landmark and tourist attraction in Stanley Park and has a restaurant and other facilities, is just west of the Lions Gate Bridge. The location of the point is known in the Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) language as Chay-thoos, meaning \"high bank\". According to Pauline Johnson's account in Legends of Vancouver, in Skwxwu7mesh tradition inside the cliffs that mark the point from the water lived a spirit-being with the power to bring storms and rain.\n\n to that used on the Lions' Gate Bridge, with the number of lanes varied depending on traffic flow and volume. However, traffic analysis showed that significant congestion would result in Surrey and New Westminster, and the idea was abandoned. TransLink also examined a number of options to install a centre-line barrier and, in concert, to ban truck traffic from the bridge because the barrier would further narrow the traffic lanes, but that too was proven impractical. A more controversial proposal is to install photo radar on the bridge to enforce the existing speed limit. Thus far, the provincial government has ruled out the idea of bringing back photo radar, which it eliminated province-wide in 2001. Oversized commercial vehicles are prohibited from using the bridge, as mandated by the British Columbia Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement agency.\n\n Access to these municipalities is limited by geography. Three major bodies of water (Howe Sound to the west, Burrard Inlet to the south, and Indian Arm to the east) and the rugged peaks of the Coast Mountains to the north isolate the North Shore from the rest of the Lower Mainland. Two road bridges (the Lions' Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway. The only other road access is by way of Highway 99 from the north or the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. The SeaBus passenger ferry, part of the Lower Mainland's transit system, connects Lonsdale Quay with Vancouver in downtown Vancouver.\n\n The presence of water on three sides limits access to downtown Vancouver. There are four major bridges: the Lions Gate Bridge, connecting to the North Shore municipalities and the Trans Canada Highway, and the Burrard Street Bridge, Cambie Street Bridge, and Granville Street Bridge, which provide access to the commercial and residential areas south of False Creek. The historic Waterfront station is the principal transit hub for the downtown core. There are six subway stations located in downtown Vancouver running on two SkyTrain lines: the Expo Line and Canada Line. The Expo Line travels from Waterfront station at the foot of the central harbor and through Dunsmuir Tunnel to the east. The Canada Line travels \n\nQuestion: Where in Canada is the Lion's Gate bridge?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He began his career in 1950 and started television and film work with roles in 12 Angry Men (1957) and Cry Terror! (1958). During the 1960s, he guest-starred on numerous television series. Klugman won his first Primetime Emmy Award for his guest-starring role on The Defenders in 1964. He also made a total of four appearances on The Twilight Zone from 1960 to 1963. In 1965, Klugman replaced Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison in the Broadway play The Odd Couple. Five years later, he reprised that role in the television adaptation of The Odd Couple opposite Tony Randall. The series aired from 1970 to 1975. Klugman won his second and third Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his work on the series. From 1976 to 1983, he starred in the title role in Quincy, M.E., for which he earned four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.\n\n Dietrich Mattausch was born on April 26, 1940, in Leitmeritz, Sudetenland (now Litoměřice, Czech Republic). He is a stage, film and television actor best known for Der Fahnder (1984), Die Straßen von Berlin (1995), and The Wonderful Years (1979). As a young adult, Mattausch trained as a forwarding agent and simultaneously took private acting lessons. He began his acting career at the Keller Theater in Mainz. In 1963 he played at Göttingen Youth Theatre, 1964-66 at the Comedy in Frankfurt am Main, 1966-67 at Landestheater Schleswig, 1968-69 at Landestheater Detmold, 1969 at the Bruchsal State Theatre, 1969-70 at Theater Baden-Baden, 1971 on the stages of Lübeck, and from 1972 to 1974 at the Deutsches Theater Göttingen. From 1975 to 1979 he was at the Schauspielhaus Hamburg where, directed by Peter Zadek, \n\n In a change of pace, Matthau played Albert Einstein in the film I.Q. (1994), starring Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan. Matthau narrated the Doctor Seuss Video Classics: How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1992) and played the role of Mr. Wilson in the film Dennis the Menace (1993). His partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most enduring collaborations in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making The Fortune Cookie and would make a total of 10 movies together—11 counting Kotch, in which Lemmon has a cameo as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the Oliver Stone drama, JFK (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy Grumpy Old Men (1993), co-starring Ann-Margret, and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men (1995), also co-starring Sophia Loren. This led to further pairings late in their careers, Out to Sea (1997) and a Simon-scripted sequel to their much earlier success, The Odd Couple II (1998). Hanging Up (2000), directed by Diane Keaton, was Matthau's final appearance onscreen.\n\n Walter Matthau (born Walter John Matthow; October 1, 1920 – July 1, 2000) was an American actor.

During this time he discovered and explored a new sector of the Antarctic that would provide the field of work for many later British expeditions.  Ross established the general geography of this region, and named many of its features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, but was unable to do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at \n\n Born in Rippingale, Lincolnshire, the son of a doctor and the grandson of a captain in the Indian Navy, he ran away from school to enter the merchant navy at the age of 13. In 1902 he became a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, and on reaching the rank of Lieutenant he was one of the last to gain a Master Mariner's certificate under sail. But he gave up a promising career to join Ernest Shackleton as the second-in-command of the Nimrod Expedition. Despite the expedition's ultimate failure, he was one of the party of four who reached the Polar Plateau for the first time ever, thus showing the way to the Pole. On 9 January 1909 they attained \n\n After Shackleton's last expedition, there was a hiatus in Antarctic exploration for about seven years. From 1929, aircraft and mechanized transportation were increasingly used, earning this period the sobriquet of the 'Mechanical Age'. Hubert Wilkins first visited Antarctica in 1921–1922 as an ornithologist attached to the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. From 1927, Wilkins and pilot Carl Ben Eielson began exploring the Arctic by aircraft. On 15 April 1928, only a year after Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Spitsbergen, arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April, touching along the way at \n\n Anthony Fiala (September 19, 1869 – April 8, 1950) was an American explorer, born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and educated at Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design, New York City. In early life he was engaged in various employments—as lithographic designer, chemist, cartoonist, head of the art and engraving department of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (1894–99), and correspondent for that paper while serving as a trooper in the Spanish–American War. In 1901 and 1902, he accompanied the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition as photographer. From 1903 to 1905, he was in command of the Ziegler Polar Expedition, sent out by Ziegler from Tromsø in July 1903. The party reached 82° 4' N, and surveyed the Franz Joseph Archipelago, but lost their ship, America in \n\n An important precursor to the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration was the Dundee Antarctic Expedition of 1892-93 in which four Dundee whaling ships travelled south to the Antarctic in search of whales instead of their usual Arctic route. The expedition was accompanied by several naturalists (including Williams Speirs Bruce) and an artist, William Gordon Burn Murdoch. The publications (both scientific and popular) and exhibitions that resulted did much to reignite public interest in the Antarctic. The performance of the whaling ships was also crucial in the decision to build the RRS Discovery in Dundee. Following on from that expedition, the specific impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given \n\nQuestion: Otis Barton was a pioneer in exploring where?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For instance, in 1956, he had a leading role in the Peggy Mount comedy, Sailor Beware! and a similar leading role in the Hylda Baker comedy, She Knows Y'Know (1962). Smith also moved into television, as Merlin the magician in the 1956 ITV series The Adventures of Sir Lancelot which was also a success in the U.S. and as Harold Wormold in the first series of the BBC sitcom Hugh and I in 1962. Smith suffered a heart attack in December 1962 and died on 5 March 1963, aged 70.\n\n Spencer Perceval (1 November 1762 – 11 May 1812) was a British statesman and barrister. He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1809 until his assassination in May 1812. Perceval is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated, and the only solicitor-general or attorney-general to have become prime minister. The younger son of an Anglo-Irish earl, Perceval was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law at Lincoln's Inn, practised as a barrister on the Midland circuit, and in 1796 became a King's Counsel. He entered politics at age 33 as a member of Parliament (MP) for Northampton. A follower of William Pitt the Younger, Perceval always described himself as a \n\n The BBC television series Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister are a satire on the British civil service and its relationship with government ministers. The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through Sir Nigel Hawthorne's Sir Humphrey Appleby. The Thick of It, first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called \"the 21st century's answer to Yes Minister\". The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of special advisors), as well as the media's involvement in the process. There is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as John Milton, John Dryden, Andrew Marvell, Robert Burns, William Wordsworth and Anthony Trollope, and diarist Samuel Pepys.\n\n Richard Evelyn Vernon (7 March 1925 – 4 December 1997) was an English actor. He appeared in many feature films and television programmes, often in aristocratic or supercilious roles. Prematurely balding and greying, Vernon settled into playing archetypal middle-aged lords and military types while still in his 30s. He is perhaps best known for originating the role of Slartibartfast in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Other notable roles included Edwin Oldenshaw in The Man in Room 17 (1965-67), Sir James Greenley, alias \"C\" in The Sandbaggers (1978-80) and Sir Desmond Glazebrook in Yes Minister (1980-81) and its sequel series Yes, Prime Minister (1987).\n\n Sir Humphrey Appleby is a fictional character from the British television series Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister. He was played originally by Sir Nigel Hawthorne, both on stage and in a television adaptation of the stage show by Henry Goodman in a new series of Yes, Prime Minister. In Yes Minister, he is the Permanent Secretary for the Department of Administrative Affairs (a fictional department of the British government). In the last episode of Yes Minister, \"Party Games\", he becomes Cabinet Secretary, the most powerful position in the service and one he retains during Yes, Prime Minister. Hawthorne's portrayal won the BATTALION Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times: 1981, 1982 , 1986 and 1987.\n\nQuestion: Where in England was actor Nigel Hawthorne born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was diagnosed with malignant pheochromocytoma, a rare, fatal form of adrenal cancer. Kubby underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 1968, 1975 and 1976. This last time, his medical records show that the cancer had metastasised to his liver and beyond. All other patients with this diagnosis have had a 100% mortality rate within five years. His physician, Dr. Vincent DeQuattro, a specialist from the USC School of Medicine, monitored his condition and treated him with conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, until referring him to the Mayo Clinic in 1981 for yet another surgery and radiation. For the next 25 years, Kubby claimed to control the symptoms of his disease solely by smoking marijuana and by maintaining a healthy diet. His original doctor, an expert on this condition shocked to learn he was still alive, said, \"In some amazing fashion, this medication has not only controlled the symptoms of the pheochromocytoma, but in my view, has arrested its growth.\"\n\nThere's Always a Way (1993) ; CENTAUR (1997, comic book) ; Mission Possible (2003) ; Conversations in Health & Fitness (2004) ; Blueprint for Success (2008) Saunders became a motivational speaker and consultant in 1984, shortly after winning the bronze medal at the USATF Championships in Johnson City, Tennessee.

Smith (1936–2003), a postal worker. He has two siblings: an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Jr. He was raised in a Catholic household in the nearby clamming town of Highlands. Smith's childhood was scheduled around his father's late shifts at the post office. His father grew to despise his job, which greatly influenced Smith, who remembers his father finding it difficult on some days to get up and go to work. Smith vowed never to work at something that he did not enjoy. Smith attended Henry Hudson Regional High School, where he was a B and C student, videotaped basketball games, and produced sketch comedy skits in the style of Saturday Night Live. An overweight teen, he developed into a comedic observer of life to socialize with friends and girls. After high school, Smith attended The New School in New York City, but did not graduate. Smith met Jason Mewes while working at a youth center; they became friends after discovering a mutual interest in comic books.\n\nKevin Reilly overcame his physical limitations through determination, hard work, and the support of others. After being diagnosed with a rare scar tissue tumor called desmoid tumor in 1976, which ended his professional football career, he underwent multiple unsuccessful surgeries. Eventually, in 1979, he underwent a complex 11 1/2 hour surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering to remove his left arm, shoulder, and five ribs. While the recovery process as an amputee was challenging and led to significant depression, Kevin managed to overcome it with the help of Rocky Bleier, another NFL player who had overcome physical trauma from the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter his surgery, Kevin focused on rehabilitation and worked hard to surpass the limitations experts expected him to have. He learned various skills such as tying a necktie with one hand, playing golf with one hand, and even participating in marathons. His dedication and perseverance allowed him to run 5 half marathons and even complete the Marine Corps Marathon.\n\nFollowing his successful rehabilitation, Kevin went on to have a fulfilling career with Xerox for 30 years. After retiring from corporate America, he became a sports radio broadcaster, appearing on the Eagles' pregame and postgame shows. Additionally, he embarked on a motivational speaking career, sharing his inspiring story with different audiences, including corporate professionals, cancer patients, recuperating soldiers, and special needs students. He has also provided counseling to victims of the Boston Marathon Bombings. In 2015, Kevin was announced as the color analyst for the Villanova Wildcats football radio team.\n\nIn summary, Kevin Reilly overcame his physical limitations by leveraging his determination, undergoing rehabilitation, learning new skills, receiving support from others, and finding new outlets for his passions and talents. Despite the challenges he faced, he managed to build a successful post-cancer life and inspire countless individuals with his story.\n\n Sharp was born in 1970 in Redding, California. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Weiser, Idaho, to open a restaurant. Sharp performed in local musicals in high school, and stayed active in music after his family moved to Sacramento, California, in 1985. Starting in 1989, he began to experience dizziness and fatigue. He was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. Kevin Sharp was given little chance of recovery. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses, Sharp met the record producer David Foster, with whom he soon became friends. After two years of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, when still in his early 20s, the cancer went into remission by the early 1990s, although he permanently lost all of his hair as a result of the radiation treatment. In high school Kevin played football and basketball. He was unable to play football and basketball during his senior year because of his cancer. The doctors eventually discovered that the cancer had spread to his lungs. Kevin Sharp was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Exactly how Genocyber was created from the bodies and souls of the two sisters remains a mystery, but it is somehow \n\n The dragon has been used as totem creature in the region of Lleida since the 5th century BC. The ancient Ilergetes people who lived in the region regarded their cheiftains to have descended from the marraco, their dragon deity, according to one source. The source which makes this ancient origins claim also describes the marraco as \"a wingless green monster with sharp fangs and a twisted snout, spitting fire from its jaws\", writing as if such lore existed since antiquity. However, this is contradicted by a different authority, which notes that it was the advent of the marraco prop built in 1907 for the parade which \"gave shape and color to this imaginary creature\". The green dragon prop set on wheels (cf. photographs above or illustration ) has been rigged with the ability to emit smoke from its nostrils, but was not equipped with the ability to simulate fire-breathing.\n\n: \"A mountain spirit and wild beast, &#91;the pictograph&#93; comes from its birdlike head, legs, and tail.\" ; : \"&#91;A creature&#93; like a dragon and yellow, in the north, they call it, &#91;the pictograph&#93; comes from the \"bug radical\" and a chi  phonetic, or, a hornless [dragon] is called chi.\" ; : \"A kind of ghost/demon, &#91;the ideograph&#93; comes from the \"ghost radical\" and chi  \"mountain demon radical\", which is also the phonetic.\" The Chinese character for, , combines the \"bug radical\" (Kangxi radical #142)—typically used in words for insects, reptiles, and dragons—with a phonetic symbol,.

First came the twelve Titans, next came the three one-eyed Cyclopes: \"Then [Gaia] bore the Cyclopes, who have very violent hearts, Brontes (Thunder) and Steropes (Lightning) and strong-spirited Arges (Bright), those who gave thunder to Zeus and fashioned the thunderbolt. These were like the gods in other regards, but only one eye was set in the middle of their foreheads; and they were called Cyclopes (Circle-eyed) by name, since a single circle-shaped eye was set in their foreheads. Strength and force and contrivances were in their works.\" Following the Cyclopes, Gaia next gave birth to three \n\n Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished: the Hesiodic, the Homeric and the wall-builders. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who made for Zeus his characteristic weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey, the Cyclopes are an uncivilized group of shepherds, one of whom, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, is encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were also said to have been the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns. A scholiast, quoting the fifth-century BC historian Hellanicus, tells us that, in addition to the Hesiodic Cyclopes (whom the scholiast describes as \"the gods themselves\"), and the Homeric Cyclopes, there was a third group of Cyclopes: the builders of the walls of Mycenae.\n\n  In Greek mythology and later Roman mythology, the Cyclopes (Κύκλωπες, Kýklōpes, \"Circle-eyes\" or \"Round-eyes\"; singular Cyclops ; Κύκλωψ, Kýklōps) are giant one-eyed creatures. Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who made for Zeus his weapon the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey, they are an uncivilized group of shepherds, the brethren of Polyphemus encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were also famous as the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns. The fifth-century BC playwright Euripides wrote a satyr play entitled Cyclops, about Odysseus' encounter with Polyphemus. Mentions of the Hesiodic and the wall-builder Cyclopes also figure in his plays. The third-century BC poet Callimachus makes the Hesiodic Cyclopes the assistants of smith-god Hephaestus. So does Virgil in his Latin epic Aeneid, where he seems to equate the Hesiodic and Homeric Cyclopes. From at least the fifth-century BC, Cyclopes have been associated with the island of Sicily and the volcanic Aeolian Islands.\n\n In Greek mythology, Sterope (Ancient Greek: Στερόπη, from στεροπή, steropē, lightning) was a daughter of Cepheus, king of Tegea in Arcadia. She received from Heracles a lock of the Gorgon Medusa's hair to help her protect her hometown, Tegea from attack thus the hero won Cepheus' friendship.\n\n  Hesiod, in the Theogony (c. 700 BC), described three Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who were the sons of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and the brothers of the Titans and Hundred-Handers, and who had a single eye set in the middle of their foreheads. They made for Zeus his all-powerful thunderbolt, and in so doing, the Cyclopes played a key role in the Greek succession myth, which told how the Titan Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos.

The Voice recounts that a baby is abandoned on a mountainside. The baby, Oedipus, is adopted by the King of Corinth. Oedipus questions the Oracle of Delphi who says he will murder his father and marry his mother. At a crossroads, Oedipus comes to blows with other travelers and unwittingly kills his father, Laius, King of Thebes. After conquering the Sphinx, Oedipus enters Thebes and claims the prize of marrying Queen Jocasta. Again, he unwittingly fulfills the Oracle's prophecy and, in marrying the Queen, marries his mother. After having four children with his mother, everything is brought to light. Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus blinds himself with his mother's brooch. The Voice finishes with: \"Before you is a fully wound machine. Slowly its spring will unwind the entire span of a human life. It is one of the most perfect machines devised by the infernal gods for the mathematical annihilation of a mortal.\"\n\n tragic tale - in which every step Oedipus took to avoid the oracle's predictions brought him closer to his fate - Oedipus killed King Laius and married Jocasta. Oedipus then became king of Thebes, as husband of the widowed Jocasta. The couple had four children, including two sons, Polynices and Eteocles. When the seer Teiresias revealed Oedipus' horrible crimes - patricide, regicide and incest, no less - Oedipus was forced to abdicate. Jocasta killed herself, and Oedipus was shunned by his own children. Oedipus responded by cursing his sons Polynices and Eteocles. Polynices and Eteocles made a pact that each should rule alternately for one year \n\n Oedipus is troubled by the faint memory of a man whom he had killed on the road for behaving arrogantly before him while Oedipus was travelling to Thebes. An elderly messenger comes from Corinth to tell Oedipus that his father King Polybus has died and for him to come and take his throne. Oedipus does not want to return as he still fears the prophecy that he will marry his mother. The messenger then tells him that Corinth's queen is not his mother, and that he was given Oedipus as a baby on mount Cithaeron. Oedipus then learns, after threatening the shepherd that gave him away, that he is in fact Jocasta's son.\n\n stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother. Although the legend of Perseus opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather Acrisius, and his abandonment with his mother Danaë, the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of Acrisius' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, Acrisius is one of the wedding \n\nOedipus is the king of Thebes, husband of Jocasta, and he is the supposed son of king Polybus of Corinth. He is the main protagonist of the play. ; Jocasta is the widow of the former king Laius, wife of Oedipus and sister of Creon. ; Creon is Jocasta's brother, and the chief aid to Oedipus in Thebes. ; Tiresias is a blind prophet who is charged by Oedipus to find the killer of King Laius. ; Manto is the daughter of Tiresias. She is used in the play to describe Tiresias' sacrifice to him, and therefore also to the audience. ; An Old Man (senex) is a messenger from Corinth who comes to tell Oedipus that Polybus is dead, and reveals part of Oedipus' history to him. ; Phorbas is an old shepherd who had given Oedipus to the Old Man when Oedipus was a child and who reveals Oedipus' real parentage to him. ; Messenger (nuntius) is the man who, in Act 5, relates what has become of Oedipus. ; The chorus are singers that aid the audience in understanding what emotion they should feel after a scene. \n\nQuestion: In Greek mythology, what were the names of Oedipus's parents?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Two hours after the attack, a second attack occurred in Mayapo, on the Llochegua District in Ayacucho, where one police officer was injured and taken to a hospital in Pichari. The government responded with helicopters being called in to respond to the incident to hunt down the perpetrators, at the same time reassuring that elections would still take place, and that nothing had changed regarding them. The attack was condemned by various figures, including then president Ollanta Humala, and prominent politicians like Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Alan Garcia, Alejandro Toledo, and Verónika Mendoza. It was also condemned by the Office of the Public Defender and the Organization of American States. The ambush marked the deadliest Shining Path attack in years and a resurgence of the group in order to disrupt the Peruvian general elections.\n\n Several international terrorist meetings were reported to have been held in Bolivia in the 1980s, including three in 1985 and 1986 that were attended by terrorist representatives from other South American countries. Two meetings between Bolivian left-wing extremists and representatives of other South American terrorist organizations allegedly were held in Cobija, Pando Department, and in La Paz in 1985. According to the deputy minister of interior, migration, and justice, representatives of terrorist organizations from eight countries held another meeting in Santa Cruz in February 1986. In early 1987, Peru's Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) began to concern Bolivian civilian and military authorities after they learned that its strategic plan called \n\n after Mao Zedong's revolution in China. The Shining Path waged a 13-year-long conflict with both the Peruvian government and rival leftist militants. Osmán Morote Barrionuevo, one of Efraín Morote's sons, became the Shining Path's second-in-command. Efraín Morote's other two children also became members of the Shining Path. Some observers, such as British writer Nicholas Shakespeare (who fictionalized the capture of Abimael Guzmán in his novel The Dancer Upstairs), have argued that Efraín Morote was probably the true intellectual leader of the Shining Path. Shakespeare described Abimael Guzmán as a man \"absolutely without character\" while he claimed that Morote was \"incredibly intelligent and without emotion,\" a truly \"evil\" man. Publicly, Morote remained until his death a respected social scientist of leftist political leanings.\n\n Comrade José (Camarada José, nom de guerre of Víctor Quispe Palomino; born 1 August 1960) is a Peruvian communist militant, leader of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru, a offshoot of the Maoist guerrilla Shining Path. The group is present in the VRAEM region. By late November 2007, DIRCOTE had identified Quispe Palomino as one of the ten most wanted terrorists in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE).

When they were young, both Drain and Hendrix got up to some mischief. Hendrix was proud of his Cherokee ancestry and liking the Native American footwear, both Drain and Hendrix each lifted a pair of moccasins. They also played instruments and jammed together. Drain and Hendrix experimented by trading licks and writing songs etc. Drain had played at some of the same clubs that Hendrix played in. Drain's influences were B.B.

He became a qualified pilot. In 1984 he exploited a production hiatus at Cessna aircraft to create the ARV Super2, a new all-British light aircraft. The Super2 was fitted with a new British engine, the Hewland AE75. Only around 40 ARVs were made before the Isle of Wight factory closed. Thrust2, the record-breaking car driven by Noble, travelled at 633.468 mph (1019 km/h) in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, US. The accomplishment won Noble the 1983 Segrave Trophy. ThrustSSC, the supersonic car driven by Andy Green, broke the record at 763.035 mph (1221 \n\n In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 1,019 km/h.

Both Thrust SSC and Thrust2 are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. Visitors can ride a 4D motion simulator depicting a computer-generated animation of the record-breaking run from the perspective of Green.

The Thrust2 is powered by a single Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine sourced from an English Electric Lightning, and has a configuration somewhat resembling that of the mid-1960s-era J79 turbojet-powered of Art Arfons, collectively known as the \"Green Monster\" cars.\n\n When the car was offered for sale at £90,000 in 1991, an extensive fundraising campaign was organised without government assistance to keep the car in Britain. The bid was successful, and today Thrust2 and its successor, ThrustSSC, are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. In 1997 Thrust2's record was broken by Richard Noble's follow up car, ThrustSSC, with a top speed of 1,228 km/h.\n\n ThrustSSC, Thrust SSC or Thrust SuperSonic Car is a British jet car developed by Richard Noble, Glynne Bowsher, Ron Ayers, and Jeremy Bliss. Thrust SSC holds the world land speed record, set on 15 October 1997, and driven by Andy Green, when it achieved a speed of 1228 km/h and became the first land vehicle to officially break the sound barrier. Both Thrust SSC and Thrust2 are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England. As part of the Museum's redevelopment project, both cars were relocated by specialist haulier from their position in the Museum's Spirit of Speed Gallery to the new Biffa Award Land Speed Record Gallery which opened in 2015. The car is 16.5 m long and 3.7 m wide and weighs nearly 10 tons. It had a total thrust of 223 kN (approximately 50,000 pounds force), equivalent to around 102,000 brake horsepower at the measured record speed (calculated using Power = Force x Velocity).\n\nQuestion: Which Brit broke the land speed record in 1990 in Thrust 2?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He still performed worldwide and celebrated his 50th anniversary as a recording artist in 2008 with the release of Reminisce Cafe.\n\n Sonny Vincent (born July 7, 1952, New York City, United States) is an American Rock musician. He has been active in music since the 60s and in particular the mid-1970s, when he was part of the New York City punk rock scene with his original band, Testors. Vincent is currently active in music, film, multi-media art, and writing. His pedigree includes mid-70s Testors' performances at C.B.G.B. and Max's Kansas City. Always active in his own bands, Vincent also spent time touring and recording for 9 years as Maureen \"Moe\" Tucker and Sterling Morrison's guitar player (both of the Velvet Underground.) Members of Vincent's bands include a vast range of players/characters, from the drummer of the Stooges, Scott Asheton, to Charles Manson's one-time guitar player, Ernie Knapp.\n\n Chevalier was born in Forest Hill near Lecompte and reared in the community of Midway in Rapides Parish just south of Alexandria, Louisiana. He claims to have grown up \"poor and naked in the piney wood hills along the banks of Bayou Boeuf.\" In 1954, Chevalier enlisted in the United States Marine Corps where he formed his first band, which appeared in 1957 on Jimmy Dean's national day-time television program on CBS. Upon his discharge from the military, Chevalier recorded his first record, \"Rockin [!!] Roll Angel\". Gene Vincent had just recorded \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\", and the two became good friends and worked together in Norfolk, Virginia. Vincent died in 1971 at the age of thirty-six.\n\n Sonny Vincent was born in New York City and had difficult relationships with his foster parents, teachers, and other adult authority figures. His earliest bands were formed in the mid and late 60s.

We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix. The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program or ERP) was a system of American economic aid to Western Europe 1948–51. It played a major role in the economic recovery, modernization, and unification of Europe. In three years the ERP gave away $12.4 billion (about 5% of the 1948 American GDP of \n\n IBRD themselves were admitting that they could not deal with the international monetary system's economic problems. The United States set up the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) to provide large-scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe largely through grants rather than loans. Countries belonging to the Soviet bloc, e.g., Poland were invited to receive the grants, but were given a favorable agreement with the Soviet Union's COMECON. In a speech at Harvard University on 5 June 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall stated: \"The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete. … Europe's requirements for the next three or \n\n Recovery Program (ERP) ran the Marshall Plan and close cooperation with the recipient nations. The money proved decisive, but the ERP was focused on a longer-range vision that included more efficiency, more high technology, and the removal of multiple internal barriers and tariffs inside Western Europe. ERP allowed each recipient to develop its own plan for the aid, it set several rules and guidelines on the use of the funding. Governments were required to exclude Communists, socialist policies were allowed, and balanced budgets were favored. Additionally, the ERP conditioned aid to the French and British on their acceptance of the reindustrialization of Germany and support for European integration. The Soviets set up their \n\n program for aid, the Molotov Plan, and the new barriers reduced trade between the Eastern bloc and the Western bloc. The Marshall Plan helped European economies recover in the late 1940s and early 1950s. By 1952, industrial productivity had increased by 35 percent compared to 1938 levels. The Marshall Plan also provided critical psychological reassurance to many Europeans, restoring optimism to a war-torn continent. Though European countries did not adopt American economic structures and ideas to the degree hoped for by some Americans, they remained firmly rooted in mixed economic systems. The European integration process led to the creation of the European Economic Community, which eventually formed the basis of the European Union.\n\n was observed by U.S. policymakers, and on June 5, 1947 Secretary of State George Marshall said that \"Europe’s requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products – principally from America – are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character.\" Ten months later, on April 3, 1948, the U.S. launched the European Recovery Program (ERP), commonly known as the Marshall Plan.

It’s further classified as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease; other such diseases include Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever.\nThe virus is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the Aedes or Haemogogus species. It’s possible for mosquitoes to transmit the virus from people with yellow fever for a short while prior to the onset of fever and for approximately five days thereafter.\nAn acute phase with fever; muscle pains, including backache; headache; episodes of shivering (rigors); nausea; and possibly vomiting and loss of appetite. Most patients improve and symptoms clear within three to four days. Fifteen percent of patients have a more severe course, entering a more serious phase after the first four days. The fever returns, and the patient rapidly develops jaundice, with abdominal pain and vomiting. Bleeding may occur. The kidneys are affected and function deteriorates. Fifty percent of patients who enter this “toxic phase” die within 10 to 14 days; the remainder usually recover fully.\nYellow fever can be difficult to diagnose, as it may mimic malaria, dengue, or other hemorrhagic fevers. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood tests, which detect the yellow fever antibodies produced in response to the viral infection. Additional sophisticated tests can help to detect the presence of the virus during the illness and even after death, when the cause of death is uncertain.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 44 nations—in Africa (31) and Latin America (13)— are at risk. The total population living in these countries is more than 900 million. WHO further estimates that since the early 1990s, 200,000 cases of yellow fever have been responsible for 30,000 deaths globally each year. Most of these cases have been in Africa. Additionally, a small number of cases are imported into countries traditionally free of yellow fever because of the movement of workers and travel in general. All these statistics would be much greater were it not for vaccination.\nThe single most important prevention measure against yellow fever is vaccination. It is safe and provides effective immunity against the disease within 10 days for 99 percent of those vaccinated. Serious side effects are extremely rare, making the risk/benefit ratio favorable, considering the significant mortality associated with yellow fever. Those who should not be vaccinated include infants younger than 9 months, pregnant women (except in an outbreak when the risk is very high), people with severe allergies to egg protein, and those with severe immune-compromised states, as in symptomatic HIV/AIDS. The risk/benefit needs to be carefully assessed in individuals over the age of 60, when adverse side effects are more common. Mosquito control is important at all times, but especially as populations are building immunity through vaccination programs.\nShould you be worried? Enough to be vaccinated, and to encourage those who may be at risk to do likewise. Prevention is better than cure!\nMust I forgive even the Rwanda genocide killers of my family?\nThe killers came on a Sabbath, brought onto the Seventh-day Adventist church’s compound by the mission president himself and his son, a physician who served as medical director of the church-owned Mugonero Hospital.\nMUGONERO ADVENTIST HOSPITAL: Some people ran toward the hospital, trying to escape the killing, but were caught by people waiting with machetes.\nThe day before Rwandans began to kill one another I was attending publishing meetings at the Rwanda Union Mission office in the country’s capital, Kigali. That night the Rwandan president’s plane was shot down, and the genocide began. The next day an employee at Mugonero Hospital called to say that my 14-year-old son, Paul, had been killed and that my wife and children had fled to the compound’s church for protection.\nThen on Sabbath, April 16, killers entered the compound with the assistance of the mission president and his son. How could this be? My father, a pastor, had worked with this president while I was growing up. I had worked with him as well. I had had no idea what was in his heart.\nThe letter was taken by a soldier who was protecting them in the church to the president’s house on the compound. The president responded that not even God could help them now.\nPeople from all over the country descended on the compound to kill the Adventists. Some of the killers were Adventist. They came with grenades, machetes, knives, anything that could kill a human being.\nA pastor was preaching when killers entered his church. They first shot and killed him. Then they started killing the others. My wife and children ran to the president’s house for help, but he turned them away. Others ran toward the hospital, trying to escape, but they were caught by people waiting with machetes. The killing inside the compound continued for several days. Day and night the killers looked for those who might have escaped. They even brought dogs to assist in searching the bush.\nBy the time the genocide ended in July, I had lost myentire family: my wife and nine children, my father and mother, three sisters, a brother, and a brother-in-law.\nThe outbreak of the genocide made it impossible for me to return home. From Kigali I was taken by a group of soldiers to a camp for internally displaced people in a northern province of the country.\nI was the only pastor in the camp. I found that when you’re busy doing good it makes you forget the bad things that have happened to you. That’s how God strengthened me.\nFORGIVING THE UNFORGIVABLE?: Isaac Ndwaniye, president of the East Central Rwandan Conference, lost his entire family in the 1994 genocide.\nWe began to meet as a congregation every Sabbath. Even though we were homeless, those who had some money gave tithe and offerings faithfully, as if they were still at home. Sometimes people from Uganda came to visit and gave us money, which we also tithed and used for offerings. We set aside the tithe until the church in Rwanda could begin working again, and we used the offerings to help treat people injured in the war.\nWhen the genocide was over in July, I traveled to Kigali and found no Adventist church operating in the country. So I went throughout the city, pleading with people to return to church. Slowly people returned to the churches. I was asked to serve as the church’s president for Rwanda for two years. Later I was elected to the Publishing Department of the Rwanda Union Mission.\nOn my first Sabbath back I called for a large district meeting.\nI stayed there for three years, and was then called to Kigali to serve as president of what today is the East Central Rwanda Conference. We praise the Lord that our conference has grown from 65,000 church members in 2004 to more than 110,000 today. Among Rwanda’s total population of 12 million, the church has about 640,000 members, and we are holding Bible studies as we hope to baptize 100,000 people in evangelistic meetings.\nMy favorite Bible verse is John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” If God had not loved everyone in the world, I would have gone and killed the killers. But God loves them, and He gives them time to repent.\nThe mission president and his son were tried and sentenced to prison for crimes against humanity and genocide. The father has died, and the son remains incarcerated.\nWhen people speak badly about the killers, I remind them that we have a God who is patient with everyone. He doesn’t want anyone to perish. That’s the only thing that can help someone like me, who has gone through such circumstances. Anytime anyone comes to God and asks for forgiveness, God forgives. There’s no sin God can’t forgive.\nAnother thing that gives me strength to continue living is that I know that one day I will see my family again. Because of that, I live for Him.\nIsaac Ndwaniye is president of the East Central Rwanda Conference. Gina Wahlen is editor of Mission, from the Office of Adventist Mission.\nDaniel’s life is a story of God’s miraculous leading and providential guidance.\nThe Gospel of Luke focuses on Jesus’ prayer life more than any other book in the Bible. Luke was a Gentile physician who longed to share the eternal truths of salvation with both Jews and Gentiles. Luke wrote his Gospel around A.D. 60 to a growing Christian community. Significantly, it is addressed to someone named Theophilus, which means “lover of God” or “a friend of God.” Luke’s purpose was to lead readers to become God’s friends. The Gospel of Luke presents a revolutionary concept: Jesus, the divine Son of God, dwelt in human flesh and, as a human, developed an intimate relationship with God in prayer.\n1. What two significant principles in Jesus’ prayer life do we discover in Luke 5:16 and 9:18?\nFor Jesus, prayer was not a spasmodic practice. He did not pray occasionally, when He “felt” a need. For Jesus, prayer was a way of life. And not only did Jesus pray often—He had regular, planned times to be alone with God (see Luke 11:1 and Mark 1:35).\n2. Compare Luke 9:28 with Matthew 18:19, 20. Why do you think praying with others is vital to our prayer experience?\nJesus often prayed with and for His disciples. Praying together unites our hearts, encourages our spirits, and lifts our vision. When we hear someone pray for us, we are strengthened by their prayers. When we unite in prayer, seeking God and interceding for others, God moves in unusually powerful ways in response to those prayers.\n3. Reflect on Jesus’ experience with Peter in Luke 22:31, 32. What impact does this incident have on your prayer life?\nWhy would it encourage each one of us? Jesus assured Peter that He was praying for him by name. What rich assurance that Jesus, the divine Son of God, knows our names and is praying for us. What encouragement for us to join Jesus and pray for others as He did.\n4. What does Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane reveal about the purpose of prayer? Read Luke 22:41-46.\nThe purpose of prayer is not for God to bend His will to conform to our will; it’s to allow His Spirit to mold our will to conform to His will. It’s not to get from God what we want, but to discover what He wants.\n5. In at least two instances in the Gospel of Luke Jesus encouraged His disciples to pray for very specific things. Read Luke 22:39, 40 and 10:2, and describe why these things are so important.\nJesus urged His disciples to pray for power over the temptations of the devil, and to pray for laborers to share His love and truth with receptive multitudes. These two prayers deal specifically with what God does in us and through us.\n6 How is Jesus’ prayer on the cross so vital for our own spiritual lives? Read Luke 23:33, 34.\nCondemned unjustly, treated unfairly, and wrongfully accused, Jesus forgave His tormentors. What a model for us!\n7 Read Luke 23:44-46. How did Jesus’ final prayer reveal the deep commitment of His life and model the true purpose of prayer?\nJesus’ prayer life reveals a life totally surrendered to the Father’s will. Jesus had one desire: to please His Father. The purpose of prayer is to bring us into an intimate relationship with God, so that all we want is what He wants. May our prayer lives be so deep, so complete, that our hearts will be united to Christ’s heart and we will be consumed with the desire to do His will.\nThe camp meeting audience broke into a wave of spontaneous applause when I reported that almost 100,000 persons had been baptized in a threeweek span in Rwanda.\nI had expected the hundreds gathered under the big pavilion roof to be at least quietly pleased at the news of the Seventhday Adventist Church’s largest-ever evangelistic campaign total, but I wasn’t prepared for the scope of their delight. The news was truly “new”—and electrifying—to many, as though they were witnessing the first showers of the promised latter rain.\nTheir joy reminded me that a deep sense of expectation undergirds all Adventist outreach—a hope that this moment, this ingathering, this harvest of souls, might be the one that inaugurates a new Pentecost. Something in our bones almost aches for the evidence that God is stirring up hearts and moving His end-time remnant beyond business as usual. And whether the result is 100 or 100,000 (for revival always has a local context), the Spirit clearly intends to restore our confidence and courage as He brings more friends and neighbors to worship and witness with us.\nAs the stories in this journal well illustrate, the Holy Spirit clearly stirred tens of thousands of church members in Rwanda to move assertively into personal mission—each in their own way, each using the gifts uniquely given them. Who dares to say that the sermon preached was more important than the loaf of bread distributed or the house built or the arm placed around a sagging shoulder? Each act— each bit of faithfulness to Jesus—matters greatly to Christ’s kingdom. The fact that the amazing result in Rwanda was owing to the active participation of at least as many members as the number of those who were baptized makes the joy that much deeper and sweeter.\nAs you read this month’s edition, pray that your own joy will deepen as you experience the delight of sharing the good news of Jesus in the way the Spirit prompts you.\nThere is no price too high. Sooner or later we will be confronted with all kinds of problems in this world.\nIt’s morning on a cold winter day, and I’m driving down the road. Misty winter landscapes pass by my window, devoid of any sun or greenery. For a moment the image of what must have been the beautiful perfection of the Garden of Eden comes to mind. How much beauty has been lost through sin! What a contrast between the freshness of that perfect creation and the dull winter colors!\nMy thoughts revolve around a man I met a week ago. Desperate, he had decided to end his life. After locking himself in his car, he soaked the interior and his clothes with gasoline and lit a match. A helicopter brought him to our burn care facility and a near-impossible mission began. We tried to bring back a life that had already decided to give up. In the end we lost the battle. How desperate must a person feel to see suicide as the only way out of their misery! Today we would meet for the last time in an autopsy room.\nI am mentally reviewing the patients who are under my responsibility in the intensive burn care facility. Each room presents another tragedy. I am especially worried about the woman who has not yet regained consciousness since the night a fire consumed her home. How am I going to explain to this mother when she wakes up from the coma that she lost her three young children in the fire that disfigured her?\nWhat a world, what pain! How disastrous when humans discover personally the secret of the knowledge of good and evil! Were Adam and Eve able to imagine the consequences of their sinful choice and what the terrible cost would be?\nAll of a sudden, a dangerous situation on the road forces me to let go of my thoughts and focus on the traffic. A driver approaching from the opposite direction has miscalculated while overtaking a truck. A violent turn of the steering wheel, several braking maneuvers—it could have ended tragically. But, once more, all is well. I can only thank God for having protected me from a serious accident. Moreover, I feel a deep gratitude for His care in a world in which death is the major rule of the game.\nLost in these thoughts, I decide to listen to some music. I put a CD into the car stereo, and a song plays whose text exalts Christ as the Lord of life. It’s a nice song, and I enjoy it whenever I listen to it. But this time it’s different.\nToday, somehow, I catch a glimpse of the magnitude of what God offers: Life! God offers life in a world marred by death. He offers life to me: to me, a mortal being with a body destined for death; to me, who cannot contribute anything to redeem myself from sin. He wants to reverse the countdown that began the day we were born and put us on the path to life. He who is life, “for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily” (Col. 2:9), has by His death on the cross put us once more within reach of the divine breath that breathed life into mud, which ultimately became Adam. He came to this world of dried-up raisins to invite us to become vines bursting with life. We no longer need to receive the wages of a fallen world. When we accept Christ, we have passed from death to life, because “the world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever” (1 John 2:17, NIV).\nClinging to this faith can help us face the worst tragedies without falling apart. While others despair, we have the assurance that God has a plan and that suffering will not last forever. Hope in the fulfillment of God’s promises makes all the difference. The certainty of living on the threshold of Christ’s second coming opens our eyes to a reality that goes far beyond the problems we experience right now.\nAs no marathon runners abandon their race a few meters from the finish line because of blisters on their feet, God’s children go forward in spite of trials. They may have their vision blurred by tears, but they keep their eyes fixed on the goal. Trusting in the Lord of life is how they receive the strength to continue.\nSometimes it seems that God does not answer our prayers. But God does answer! He has already given the definite answer: “Whoever has the Son has life” (1 John 5:12, NIV). It is almost too easy to believe. If we do not grasp this, we may pray for a miracle; and when no miracle comes, we will be discouraged by God’s apparent silence. We may even be tempted to think that God simply doesn’t hear our prayers, or even doubt His existence.\nThis is a trap, for He certainly always hears us. And if it sometimes seems that He remains silent it is because He has already given the answer: “She is not dead, but sleeping” (Luke 8:52).\nIt’s vital that we human beings possess this kind of “life insurance,” which guarantees life in the face of death (cf. John 11:25). Our insurance policy is to have the Son of God, the authentic resurrection and life. Christ is the wonderful formula that transforms death into a slumber.\nThis seems too simple. I can neither provide scientific evidence nor explain this medically. But God has said so, and we trust Him by faith. “But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope,” writes Paul. “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. . . . For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first” (1 Thess. 4:13-16). What more could God give His children?\nSo I continue driving with a renewed hope in my heart. I sense that, today, God helped me to see something important more clearly. And because I believe unshakably in the superabundant sufficiency of God’s power I follow the advice of the apostle Paul when he adds: “Therefore comfort one another with these words” (1 Thess. 4:18).\nAriel E. Noltze, M.D., is a specialist in plastic surgery and hand surgery. He works at a center of reconstructive surgery in Vienna, Austria, where he lives with his family.\nAll Juvenal Nsengiyumva, a 47-year-old university teacher, determined to rise to the challenge when he learned in January that each of the 720,000 Seventh-day Adventists in Rwanda was being encouraged to actively share Jesus’ love with their neighbors.\nBut how could he participate in the Total Member Involvement program, which would culminate in a nationwide evangelistic series in late May?\nWhile hundreds of preachers were needed at evangelistic meeting sites across the African country, Nsengiyumva couldn’t take the time off work to prepare and deliver the two weeks of sermons.\nSo Nsengiyumva took stock of what he had: a caring wife, Marianne, and four children; an aging but reliable car; some cash; and fluent English skills obtained during five years of studies in India.\n“First and foremost, I am an active member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and you know an active member has to tell the truth that he or she knows to others,” said Nsengiyumva, an elder at the Gates of Hope Adventist Church in the resort city of Gisenyi.\nNsengiyumva’s three daughters and son—Hope, 12; Friend, 9; Meek, 7; and Merciful, 5—went through their clothes and chose some to give away to those who needed them. Their mother washed and ironed them to make them look like new.\n“We have to teach them to be cheerful givers,” Nsengiyumva said. The family also donated US$70 toward the US$8,000 cost of a new house for a widow.\nIn addition, Nsengiyumva signed up to serve as an interpreter for a visiting preacher from the United States, and to drive the speaker to the meeting site, an hour-long roundtrip that followed his regular day of teaching.\nIt was all worth it, he said. A total of 168 people were baptized at the church where he interpreted, a figure that far exceeded the goal of 30 baptisms set by church leaders for each of the 2,227 meeting sites around the country.\nIt is the active involvement of people like Nsengiyumva that paved the way for the largest baptism in the Adventist Church’s history, local church leaders said. An unprecedented 97,344 people were baptized during the May 13-28 evangelistic meetings (as of June 2), and additional baptisms connected with the event are expected to push the total past 100,000 in subsequent months.\n“I can tell you that this success came about because each member in the Rwanda Union got involved in every detail of the operation,” said Blasious M. Ruguri, president of the Adventist Church’s East-Central Africa Division, whose territory of 11 countries includes Rwanda.\nChurch members studied the Bible with their neighbors and went door-to-door, inviting people to the evangelistic meetings. They donated nearly $350,000 to construct and repair housing and buy cows, food, clothing, and health insurance for the needy. Medical volunteers treated nearly 6,000 people for a week at free clinics at three locations.\n“No member thought this was a burden; in fact, every member desired to be given a chance to participate,” said Ruguri, who preached at a meeting site in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali.\nRwanda, with a population of 11.8 million people, stands as an example for Adventist believers worldwide, church leaders said. All union presidents from the East-Central Africa Division preached in Rwanda in May, and they plan to replicate the Total Member Involvement program in the run-up to major evangelistic series in their home countries in June 2017. Even the president of the Adventist Church in Zambia, which is located in another church division, flew to Rwanda to view the proceedings firsthand.\nThe previous record for baptisms was 30,000, after a two-week evangelistic series in Zimbabwe in May 2015. Just two months later, world church leaders unveiled the Total Member Involvement initiative at the General Conference Session in San Antonio, Texas. Total Member Involvement (TMI) encourages each of the church’s 19.1 million members worldwide to find ways to share Jesus with friends and communities.\nAlthough named at the General Conference session, Total Member Involvement is not particularly bold or new, said Duane McKey, a key organizer of the Rwanda meetings and the Adventist world church leader responsible for the program.\nMost of the presenters are regular church members from Rwanda, McKey said. But 98 speakers came from the General Conference, the administrative body of the Adventist world church, and another 70 came from the church’s Nairobi, Kenya based East-Central Africa Division. Some two dozen came from France. Many funded their own way.\nSpeakers called the event unforgettable and spoke of related blessings in their own lives. A 22-year-old international student studying in the United States told how a Muslim woman and a public university funded her trip. A 12-year-old boy rejoiced over leading hundreds of people to Christ. A Canadian woman who lost relatives in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide was finally able to forgive (see sidebars).\nAbner De los Santos, a general vice president of the Adventist world church, described his joy at unexpectedly joining two overwhelmed local pastors in a church baptismal tank to baptize 528 people at a church in Kigali on Sabbath, May 28.\nDe los Santos and his wife, Leticia, a music teacher, preached at two churches in Kigali’s Rusororo district.\nAnother general vice president of the Adventist world church, Geoffrey Mbwana, also led evangelistic meetings.\nAdventist Church president Ted N. C. Wilson, who led evangelistic meetings in Gisenyi, thanked local church members for their participation on the last Sabbath. “You are an example for the entire world. We praise God for that,” Wilson told a crowd of 6,000 people.\nAmong those present were 1,971 people who had been baptized in nearby Lake Kivu in the morning, and Nsengiyumva, the university teacher who found several ways to participate in Total Member Involvement.\nNsengiyumva said he couldn’t be happier. “I praise God that He fulfilled my wishes to participate in the preaching of His message,” he said.\nAndrew McChesney is news editor of Adventist World.\n\nWe bring you a special episode, celebrating the award of this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Tasuku Honjo, Distinguished Professor at Kyoto University. His basic research has led to the development and clinical applications of Opdivo, a groundbreaking new anti-cancer drug that works with immune cells. It has given hope to many cancer patients, and surprised clinical specialists. We'll explore what innovation Opdivo has brought to cancer treatment, and what challenges remain.\nPeriodontal disease affects more people worldwide than any other illness, according to the Guinness World Records. It destroys gum and bone, eventually causing teeth to fall out. Periodontal disease may also be linked to life-threatening illnesses, such as pneumonia and diabetes. One drawback of standard treatments is that it's difficult to restore damaged tissue. But a drug developed in Japan regenerates gum and bone, and saves teeth. We'll also look at ways to maintain good oral hygiene, even when disaster strikes.\nSpecialist maxillofacial surgeons Tim Martin and Sat Parmar prepare for a marathon operation on 53-year-old Teresa. Four weeks ago, Teresa was diagnosed with a fast-growing cancerous tumour in her face and she will die within weeks unless it is removed. The procedure involves radical surgery to the entire right-hand side of her face, and means she will lose both her upper jaw and right eye. It is an enormous undertaking for Teresa, and for Tim and Sat, too. Using 3D imaging, the team plan how to remove the tumour and, most importantly, how they will rebuild Teresa's face. Tim and Sat are all too aware that whilst removing the tumour will save her life, it will be devastating if she is left disfigured and unable to face the world. To give her the best possible outcome, they intend to fill the cavity left in Teresa's face with a section of bone and muscle removed from her hip, using a 3D-printed plastic guide that helps them cut out the correct shape bone.\nThe brain was once thought to be the body's control tower, issuing commands to the other organs. But scientists are discovering that communication flows between all the organs in our bodies. They transmit messages that can boost immunity, improve memory, strengthen bones and even lengthen lifespan. Innovative treatments are being developed to harness the power of this hidden network. But what happens when there's a communication breakdown? We look for clues using the latest technology.\nThe latest episode of Medical Frontiers is part of a special series which looks at superfoods around the country. This time we visited Oita Prefecture, where fewer people have died from colorectal cancer over the past 10 years than anywhere else in the country. Research has found that's due to 3 foods the locals eat regularly that help maintain gut health: kabosu citrus fruit, shiitake mushrooms and onions. We'll look at the part these superfoods play in the local diet, share the latest findings on their key components and bring you some healthy, delicious recipes using them.\nChronic lower back pain can be both debilitating and frustrating. The cause is often unclear, making it difficult to treat. As a result, many people give up on medical treatment. Now, researchers in Japan are using new approaches that target the body and the brain to successfully offer relief. One therapy eases pain with injections of saline solution. In another, a simple exercise helps people overcome the fear of pain and promotes recovery.\nAs winter sets in, US Rangers must capture Hill 400, a strategic peak on the German border.\nFresh or processed, white or red - how does meat measure up? It's been getting a lot of bad press recently with new links to cancer and heart disease. But 98 per cent of us in the UK are still meat eaters. Chris Bavin, a greengrocer by trade and a carnivore by nature, wants to know if he can keep meat in his diet and stay healthy. He teams up with top scientists to put meat under the microscope and examine it as never before. They follow 40 volunteers on a groundbreaking study to find out exactly how much meat is good for us, test whether paying more for chicken makes it any better for us, discover a way to dramatically reduce the health risks associated with processed meats and reveal an unlikely lean supermeat that won't break the bank.\nAn ambitious account of the story of human physiology in a feature-length dramatised documentary. Harnessing the magic of the most modern visual effects, we tell the story of the human body—inside and out—as it lives, grows, and dies on this predestined journey we call life. This unique National Geographic docudrama traces the life of a man, Adam, from the Cradle to the Grave, explaining the science behind our highs and lows, the rites of passage we all go through and exploring the inner workings of our bodies and how they change through time. The 90-year-old narrator, Adam, reflects on his life from conception through boyhood, adolescence and beyond, revealing the events that shape him. Along the way we meet the class bully, Adam's first love and the sergeant major preparing him and fellow recruits for Vietnam. With the aid of stunning computer-generated visuals, we go under the skin to reveal how Adam's body responds to major life events, and his story is told in dramatic scenes from the 1950s to the present day.\nCan't Cook or Won't Cook?\nOne in five families eat convenience foods at least three times a week and a government survey showed only one in six mothers cook from scratch every day. In the first of four food programmes over the next fortnight, the Tonight programme investigates why some of us can’t cook or won’t cook and what can be done to get Britain back in the kitchen. The UK has the largest consumption of ready meals in Europe. It’s no surprise; they are cheap, convenient and easy. A few minutes in a microwave and dinner is served. But for some families the ready meal isn’t always the first choice, it’s sometimes the only choice.\nIf you were told you could get fit with just a few minutes of exercise a week would you believe it? Anja Taylor looks at whether exercise impacts aging and if changes in your mitochondria resulting from exercise effectively retard aging.\nOver your lifetime you undergo an extraordinary change - no other animal on earth goes through such a dramatic metamorphosis. In this programme, Chris and Xand van Tulleken explore the latest understanding of how we all grow.\nIn recent years, eating has become a health hazard. We love our potato chips, candy, and fast food…however bad they are for our health. And we still continue to consume these products in ever greater quantities. After the war on tobacco, a new battle is underway: the fight for healthier food. So, why do we consume so much processed food and why are we so hooked on it? How exactly does the relentless agribusiness keep us coming back for more? How does it mold our tastes, influence our cravings and feed our addictions? The few independent researchers who dare raise concerns about processed food are often ignored. Opposite them, the giant multinationals who fund the majority of research into nutrition are highly organized, and present at every level of decision-making. They are even involved in government campaigns on nutrition and health. Remi, our French-American reporter, will investigate current eating habits in Europe and America, and meet those involved in this new global food war. We will hear from scientists tracking sugar addiction, the businessmen playing on our weaknesses, legal experts preparing to challenge the might of the industry, and simple lovers of good food. A compelling documentary that reveals the latest ways the agribusiness is trying to tempt us, and the ways we as consumers can try to resist.\nAs his name suggests, rapper and documentary maker Professor Green has a past relationship with cannabis. Before finding success as a musician he sold weed, and between the ages of 16 and 24 he smoked cannabis every day - but things have changed since then. With those days behind him, Professor Green, aka Stephen Manderson, embarks on a uniquely personal film to take an in-depth look at our relationship with Britain’s most popular illegal drug and explores the arguments for and against legalisation. Stephen explores today’s booming UK cannabis industry, from the realities of life as a dealer, grower and even weed robber, to the consumers with ever-increasing options about how and what they buy. With cannabis laws around the world now changing – as US States like California fully legalise the drug – Stephen meets those hoping to make their future millions out of legalisation here in the UK. As he comes to reflect on his background and wrestle with his own past, Stephen explores addiction and the links between cannabis use and mental health.\nGloria and Chris settle the argument over whether tea and coffee are good or bad for us - and if the same is true for both.

This week's Insight tackles the ground-breaking science and personal stories around the gut's potential to change our lives.\nWe look at scientific research that links the way babies are born with health in later life, particularly the increased risk of children developing certain immune-related conditions, including asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, cardio-vascular diseases, mental health disorders and even some cancers.\nEpisode 4 – reveals the surprising impact sugar can have on our health. The added sugars in most packaged foods are one of the deadliest ingredients in our modern diet. But the naturally-occurring sugars, antioxidants and nutrients found in most fruits and berries make these sweet treats some of the healthiest foods on our planet.\nFor 70 years we've waged war against harmful bacteria using antibiotics. But bacteria are fighting back and today more and more bacterial infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Drug-resistant superbugs are spreading; not just MRSA - also TB, pneumonia, e-coli. In Britain, hundreds are already dying of these infections - mainly the very young or the frail and elderly. But experts warn that unless we crack the problem, by 2050 we'll be facing a massive health crisis with over 10 million people dying of resistant bacterial infection worldwide every year.\nThe World Health Organisation has described stress as 'the health epidemic of the 21st century'.

From the moment they draw their initial breath - itself an incredibly complicated biological feat - to their first steps, it's a year of remarkable development. In The Science of Babies, Nat Geo explores the amazing biomechanical benchmarks achieved in the first 12 months of human life. Using CGI, fMRI and other tools, viewers can watch as a baby's lungs draw breath for the first time, and can witness the heart grow exponentially in order to power this incredible developing creature. Perhaps even more fascinating is the manner in which the neurosynapses develop, creating the essence of what will become a new personality and intellect. This film explores the amazing mechanics behind the initial milestones in a human infant's life, and even compares them to babies of other species. Beyond simply being a beautiful film to watch, the technology that Nat Geo uses to help tell the tale is remarkable.\nIs sugar the new tobacco? How did the food industry get us to stop asking the question: is sugar toxic? It all starts with a secret PR campaign dating back to the 1970s. For forty years, Big Sugar deflected all threats to its multi-billion dollar empire, while sweetening the world's food supply. As obesity, diabetes, and heart disease rates skyrocket, doctors are now treating the first generation of children suffering from fatty liver disease. The sugar industry is once again under siege. They dodged the bullet once. Can they do it again?\nReveals just how dangerous too much fat is to our most vital internal organs. The programme follows a specialist pathology team as they conduct a post-mortem on the body of a 17-stone woman whose body was donated to medical science.

He can do calculations to 100 decimal places in his head, and learn a language in a week.\n\n“When do we stop?” my patient’s son asked me.\n“That’s really hard to know,” I answered.\nWe were discussing when to stop making interventions in hopes of trying to save his father’s life. He’d been diagnosed with a severe gastrointestinal bleed from a stomach ulcer. Though most bleeding of this kind is identified in time and stopped, my patient had lost nearly half his blood volume and passed out before anyone realized anything was wrong. By the time his family had brought him to the emergency room, he was hypotensive, unconscious, and in acute kidney and liver failure. He was admitted directly to the ICU, transfused eight units of blood, and put on a ventilator. Forty-eight hours later, his kidney function had worsened enough that we were considering beginning him on dialysis, and he’d developed an aspiration pneumonia.\n“It’s just one thing after another,” his son lamented when I told his family this news.\nI nodded. We see this commonly, I told him. When one organ system starts to fail for any reason, others frequently follow, like lemmings diving off a cliff, either as a direct result of the failure of the first organ system or as a result of the same insult that caused the first organ system to fail (as in his father’s case). Additionally, if there’s one adage in medicine that’s both tragically true and unappreciated by laypeople it’s that interventions (like ventilators) to reverse or manage complications (like brainstem injury) frequently lead to more complications (like aspiration pneumonia).\nBrainstem testing in my patient on the third day, however, revealed improvement, suggesting the initial damage he’d sustained as a result of prolonged low blood pressure might be at least partially reversible. And though on that particular day his kidney function had taken a slight turn for the worse and we’d decided to begin dialysis (hoping to use it as a bridge until his kidney function recovered completely) the day before it had actually improved. Which direction was it really going? We didn’t know. His liver, on the other hand, was definitely coming back.\nSo many difficult questions confronted us, questions we needed to ask not just once but every day: which systems were improving? Which were worsening? Which could improve and which couldn’t? The answers changed every day as the enormous volume of data we collected on every aspect of his body’s function changed. Individually, each organ system that had taken a hit retained the potential to heal—no insult, as far as we could tell, was definitively irreversible. But we also knew, statistically speaking, that with each additional organ system affected in a critically ill patient, the likelihood that the patient will recover diminishes significantly. Every cog in the human body retains influence on every other cog, it seems.\nThe most challenging problem in inpatient medicine—especially in ICU medicine—turns out not to be figuring out how to fix what’s broken, but rather figuring out when not to try. We’re confronted by this problem in other contexts in medicine as well, however. With patients who suffer from dementia, that cruelest of diseases (which always progresses), we often have to ask ourselves when to stop intervening. Dementia, many people don’t realize, is uniformly fatal. Given enough time, all demented patients will become non-verbal and stop eating. At what point, then, do we withhold antibiotics for pneumonia, for example? Or insert a feeding tube (via the skin overlying the stomach) to augment declining nutrition? For a doctor lacking a personal connection to the human being their severely demented patient once was, these choices are difficult at best. For family members who retain a vivid picture of their loved one in full possession of all their faculties, they’re agonizing. For this reason, laying the burden of making life-and-death decisions on family members has always struck me as particularly cruel. And yet a balance must be struck between assuming paternal authority to make such decisions unilaterally in order to spare families from feeling responsible for ending their loved one’s life and allowing family members to act as surrogate decision makers who must often guess at what their loved one would have wanted (as often no discussion of end-of-life wishes ever took place). And the reality is that even when patients themselves are awake, alert, and competent, they often have difficulty themselves navigating all the potential risks and benefits of the interventions we in the medical profession are able to offer.\nSo we simply all do our best. We try to balance a reaction to today’s data and the interventions they suggest we make with the broader picture and the likely long-term outcome. Keeping a sharp eye on both, knowing which to believe more on any given day, is extremely challenging. But this is where the art of medicine lives and wisdom and compassion are most vitally required.\nIn the end, my patient survived. His kidneys recovered and he came off dialysis. But the injury to his brain proved extensive: he was no longer able communicate in any way other than through grunts and could no longer bathe, dress, or feed himself. Prior to his hospitalization, he’d been a CPA heading up a busy, privately-owned business. Afterward, he required twenty-four hour care. I wanted to ask him if he was glad he’d survived, if we’d made the right choices for him. But it wasn’t clear to me at that point if he would have even understood the question.\nThat’s so sad. I hoped when half way through the story it would have a happy ending but not so.\nAlex, my mom suffered a massive stroke in her left brain (she was right-handed) earlier this year and after consulting with her doctors at UIC, we made the difficult decision of withholding extraneous medical interventions and letting her go in peace. It was a difficult decision and months later, I still cry when thinking about my mom’s passing and hope we had made the right decision. Thank you for sharing your insight as a physician and as always, your wisdom and your compassion.\nI think I know his answer. Who would want to live like that? Not me and not anyone I have asked. Quality of life is much more important than quantity. And I believe God was telling this man it was his time to die. No one listened and he is paying the price!\nYou have raised an interesting question, but there is one issue you haven’t addressed: money. Who will pay for such extended care?\nHowever, my concern about money isn’t addressed to the first case you’ve presented, but to those you’ve mentioned in passing: patients well on the road to dementia—a condition you’ve noted is fatal.\nToday, a substantial minority of our citizens lack even the basics of health insurance, and the costs of Medicare continue to rise. Perhaps we should rethink what interventions we offer to those patients who have gone down the pathway to dementia. Feeding tubes? To what end? Ventilators? Why even begin? IV antibiotics for pneumonia? For these patients, admission to the ICU makes no sense, yet it’s not uncommonly done. Both my head and my heart tell me that comfort care is the path to follow.\nYet somehow, Medicare continues to fund mammograms, biopsies, surgeries and even chemo for demented women whose perception is that they are being tortured. Some physicians continue PSA testing for male patients with dementia. A recent article in the NEJM has a list of conditions in which the authors suggest such treatments are totally inappropriate.\nYes, I am saying that at least partly, it’s a matter of money. (The NEJM agrees.) IMHO, treatment for patients with dementia should be available, but their treatment costs (if the family is insistent on treatment) should be borne by the family, not by the taxpayer.\nMedicine can now prolong the dying process almost indefinitely, through the use of expensive technologies and medications that hold no hope of cure. But the outcome—death—is the same. It just takes a lot longer.\nI don’t remember the author of this quote, but I think he had a point.\nIt’s not enough to ask ALL patients’ families, What do you want done? We also need to help them understand that in some instances and at a certain point, interventions are futile. Society may pay the financial costs, but the patients pay dearly in suffering, confusion and lost quality of life. Patients with end-stage disease often live longer if they enter hospice programs than if they continue intensive medical interventions.\nAnd especially, physicians need to convey that in the case of a demented patient, no intervention can ever bring back the person their loved one once was.\nSo, how did the son/family feel about the outcome? Did your patient end up in a nursing home then? Or did family members assume his care? Did he/they have any advance directives in place?\nChris: I’m afraid I don’t know the answers to any of your questions except the last (and to that one, yes).\nAlex, I read your story with a heavy heart. It saddens me that the family had to go through such an ordeal, not to even mention the pt and what he went through. Maybe now, as he lives, he doesn’t have an inclination of his total debility and need for total care? Isn’t end-stage dementia terribly hard on the family, with the pt not really understanding the degree of their debility? I know a pt of mine, her husband was placed in a nursing home, private pay, b/c she couldn’t care for him any more. It was draining her financially and emotionally. She was crying, telling me for the first time her husband didn’t recognize her when she visited him, and she didn’t know how much longer she could afford to pay for his care, at over $4,000/month. I wanted to tell her that it was OK to let him go b/c he left a long time ago, but I wasn’t sure if it was my place. It broke my heart seeing her in such sorrow, not being able to offer anything to her except listening. Maybe that was enough at that time? I believe as our bodies last longer and longer, way past the time our brains are functioning, the questions and the decisions will get harder and harder. My mother, who is 73 and in fairly good health, wants every miracle medical science can offer her to stay in this world. The cost is extremely high, both financially and emotionally. Does it have to do with the inability to let go, the fear of the unknown, and the fear of the emotional pain that comes with loss? I work with end-stage dementia often…no one is home upstairs, and yet, the family just wants them to be who they were…which will never happen. It truly saddens me.\nHow sad. This man deserved comfort & palliative care.\nI know I wouldn’t want to survive in his condition.\nIf we have never looked closely at end-of-life issues; if we have thought that those issues are only for medical people to think about/meditate upon; if we have never looked at a frail elderly person or a person with dementia and tried to imagine ourselves in his/her position; if we have never developed the habit of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes; if we have never learned to identify with another, not matter what their age or stage . . . then we will hang on and be unable to let go. Never having considered death, our own or that of someone close to us . . . is blindness. We will be blind and fearful about decisions around end-of-life.\nWhy do we set ourselves up to be blind and fearful?!\nAlex prompts us, with posts such as this, to consider our mortality and that of others. Never mind the anxiety that this consideration may bring. In time, the anxiety diminishes a little or a lot. Guts is what we need in order to keep ourselves from being blind and fearful!\nAlex, thank you for an insightful essay. Oftentimes when I have “end-of-life” discussions with my well patients, to help them fill out their Living Will documents, they tell me of situations where a loved one had a living will but ended up with multiple interventions anyway, to no good end. Your case illustrates well how that happens: it is not always clear at the onset what that outcome will be. The difficulty, as you discuss, is in deciding when enough is enough. If we all had a crystal ball to look into the future, there are a lot of decisions we might make differently! We do the best we can with the information we have on hand, and sometimes people surprise us by full recovery when things have looked extremely bleak, and other times the outcome, sadly, is as you describe. In dealing with the issue of how far to go with the demented patient, or for that matter any number of other situations where aggressive interventions will never return the patient to any good quality of life, we are often forced to provide what we know are futile treatments because the laws require interventions unless the patient or their proxy make a “decision” to forego life-prolonging treatments. Both lawmakers and families don’t understand that this would be analogous to requiring that we prescribe an unproven drug when we know it won’t help, just because they request it! And yet in that case, we are allowed to use our medical judgment and gently say no, it will not help.\nMy dad, a fit and fine 86 year old, went on a walk, fell down and suffered a femur fracture. And then as you say one cog leading to another: 13 bottles of blood, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, mesenteric angiography to try find out what on earth was the matter, finally a high risk colonoscopy, yes, on the ventilator, arrhythmia, lung infection that was on and off, and then very bad, and finally renal failure.\nIn those three months outside the ICU, I grew up ten years. Not one antibiotic or antifungal untried. And other than the last one day, he was conscious, he knew, he knew he was going.\nI count the days, I go on.\nIn India, the patient pays, or God bless.\nAs a pastor, I often am called in to assist the family in making such decisions, and it is indeed difficult at best. From a purely medical standpoint you have the unenviable task of playing God. Trying to see how things will turn out in the end. From a spiritual standpoint, I have the task of helping families turn to their faith and know that it’s ultimately ok to let their loved one go when the time comes.\nWhat I appreciate about this entry is how it clarified the issue. So often in these situations we carry on valiantly without pausing to consider the overall process of what’s going on. For myself, it’s the heartache caused by trying to do more, and more, with less and less effect that makes these types of circumstances so difficult, combined with the lack of easy answers to such dilemmas.\nIt provides me a valuable reminder of the need to practice compassion when these situations arise; to extend it to all the people involved, and also to myself.\nMy 92-year-old mother who has dementia and lives in a nursing home fell and broke her hip. The doctors told me that the outcome for a patient her age with this type of injury is usually not good. I prayed that God would take her. My mother stopped being my mother years ago. The dementia had seen to that. I prayed that she would be released from this world. She would never want to live the way she was living. She came through the surgery with flying colors. She went on to recover quickly and fully and is walking again. My husband swears that she recovered as quickly as she did because she had no idea what was wrong and what was happening—she never worried about a thing. Her body is healthy but her mind is gone. It is so unfair.\nBarbara: It is so unfair. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.\nIt seems like relief from suffering is what people are hoping for (at least, suffering without a positive goal or purpose). But how much are the demented suffering? I’ve heard it said that the spiral into dementia is thought by some to be a sort of unwinding of the brain as it loses function, but not necessarily felt as suffering by the individual. My mother-in-law went through this process over 6 years before she finally died (from pneumonia), and her body was quite healthy throughout that time. I often wondered how it seemed from her side. The relief from suffering of those around the patient seems to be a real puzzle, however.\nI would guess that the son feared this outcome, which is why he asked the question.\nMy father had a living will and spoke to me and my siblings several times about his desire to never be on life support. When he had a major stroke at the age of 80 and was taken, unconscious, to a hospital by ambulance, he was put on a respirator without our knowledge. We told the doctors that his living will requested that a respirator not be used and they said the living will didn’t matter. Once the respirator was on it had to stay. (We were told this might have been because it was a Catholic hospital.) A well-meaning pulmonary technician actually said to me that I shouldn’t worry because he could live for years like this! Anyway we finally found a sympathetic doctor who removed the respirator and he died a few days later. I never doubted that we did the right thing.\nYour explanation of dementia—always fatal, loss of appetite and memory—was very helpful. My oldest sister died May 3 after a long struggle after a hip replacement surgery (2006) during which her lung was punctured. She stopped eating and her ability to remember things began to disappear, except for the names (and spellings) of teachers she worked with years ago. Last fall, her daughter took her to a new doctor who diagnosed her with moderate dementia. I emailed my other sister, saying that moderate should mean it’s taken a while to develop—and wondering why other doctors didn’t recognize it earlier. Her response, “Yes.” My oldest sister was 75, but most of my relatives lived until their late 80s or early 90s with very sharp minds. She lived in Florida, near her daughter, who did everything possible to help her mom.\nDementia, many people don’t realize, is uniformly fatal.\nWe should consider this more often in making all our decisions.\nOne thing that is not addressed in the original post or any of the comments I’ve read so far is time. If I’ve read correctly, the man was a fully active alert adult just before he was admitted to the ICU.\nI do not think that having to make end-of-life decisions in that situation is comparable to making them for a person who has over the years succumbed to dementia or another progressive disease. There is TIME to think and accept in those situations.\nAm I wrong in thinking that until the body recovered, the state of the man’s mental condition was not known?\nMy husband has mild dementia now. He is 71 and he is going to have a stent tomorrow. He is also going to continue to have his bladder cancer monitored and treated. He’s going to continue taking medications for his diabetes. His colon and prostate cancers have been deemed cured, but unless his dementia has progressed significantly, he will still have a colonoscopy in 5 years as well as a PSA test occasionally.\nSince it is possible that at least some of his dementia is caused by normal pressure hydrocephalus, after his stent is placed and his cardiologist deems him ready for elective surgery, we’re going to explore the possibility of a shunt.\nI am not a newcomer to caring for people with dementia. Before my husband, there was my mother, my father-in-law, my step-mother… and I am fully supportive of hospice care at the end of life.\nI am also not a newcomer to caring for people who wish their lives had not been saved by modern medical interventions such as ventilators. The major depression that sometimes follows traumatic brain injury is a doozy. Yet… he (not my husband, but another relative) has today told jokes, laughed at mine, and expressed a desire to die. How do you deal with that kind of mercurial change of mood?\nThe point I want to make is that these kind of decisions cannot be addressed morally with policies or rules written by bureaucrats—each case is different. Three different times I have said “no interventions, let them go” and twice I have said “do whatever you can.” In my husband’s case, even if he has a “not-stoppable” dementia, he still has several years before he “loses his mind completely” and I’m not giving those up just yet.\nBottom line: more often than not there is no easy, bright line answer to the question of when to cease medical interventions.\nOMG, I am feeling terrible, watching this helpless man. The story itself is repeating from time to time and people getting caught and diagnosed too many times too late.\n\n The narrator is a Stone Age tribal singer who reacts badly to criticism of his work. He also deals badly with other artists whose work he dislikes. He kills a younger singer as well as a cave painter. His actions are noticed by his tribe's totem, who visits him in a dream.

The family is Roman Catholic and attends St. John's Catholic Church in Valatie.\n\n Kenneth James Gibson was born in Canada, grew up in El Paso, Texas and currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He first learned how to play guitar on his fathers acoustic and got his first 4-track recorder at age 19. Gibson founded the 1990s noise rock band Furry Things, who released most of its material on King Coffey's (of the Butthole Surfers) Trance Syndicate / Touch and Go Records imprint. He has also released music that spans across many genres under aliases such as [a]pendics.shuffle, Eight Frozen Modules, dubLoner, Reverse Commuter, and Hiss & Buzz (with Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto). He founded the electronic music record label Adjunct Audio in early 2005 with friend Konstantin Gabbro, through Kompakt records. Gibson along with Brian McBride of the drone-based ambient music duo Stars of the Lid, started the band \n\n Gibson married JoAnn Sklarski on December 22, 1985, in a double ceremony where Tiger pitcher Dave Rozema married JoAnn's sister Sandy. They were married at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. The Gibsons reside in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and have four children: Colleen, Cam, Kirk, and Kevin. Gibson's son Cam was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 5th round, 160th overall, in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. His son Kevin is a defenseman for the Fort Wayne Komets in the ECHL. Gibson set an aviation record in 1987. He flew a Cessna 206 to a height of 25,200 feet in Lakeland, Florida. The record was certified by the National Aeronautic Association. He was nominated for induction into the College Football Hall of Fame multiple times before being elected in 2017. Gibson is an avid deer hunter. He and former teammate David Wells, along with former MLB pitcher Jake Peavy, own a 1,300-acre hunting ranch near Millersburg, Michigan, which they named the \"Buck Falls Ranch\". On April 28, 2015, it was announced that Gibson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\n Gibson, the son of George Henry and Elizabeth Johns Gibson, was born on February 4, 1878 and grew up in Baltimore. He was nicknamed \"Little Giant\", and graduated from Morgan College Preparatory School. He later received an honorary LLD degree from the school in June 1928. Gibson moved to Philadelphia in 1899. He initially worked in various odd jobs, and had stints peddling meat and caning chairs, before moving into the theatrical world in 1910, when Samuel Reading hired him as a partner in his movie and Vaudeville theatre, The North Pole. Though the North Pole theatre was not a success in the end, Gibson remained optimistic and bought out Reading for $800. Gibson married Ella on September 15, 1914.\n\n Peter Gibson (born April 14, 1971 in Greenwich, Connecticut) is an American writer. He is the third of five children: Robert Christian Gibson Jr. (nicknamed, Gibby), Paula Elizabeth Gibson, Jeffrey Michael Gibson & Michael Patrick Gibson.

The Daley family has had a strong presence in Chicago mayoral politics. Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley both served as mayor. Richard J. Daley's son (and Richard M. Daley's brother) William Daley unsuccessfully ran in the 2019 mayoral election, finishing third in the first round of voting. Another father-son duo who had both occupied the mayor's office was Carter Harrison Sr. and Carter Harrison Jr. 1955 Republican nominee Robert E. Merriam was the son of 1911 Republican nominee (and unsuccessful 1919 Republican primary candidate) Charles E. Merriam. Both Merriams lost their elections. 1919 candidate Maclay Hoyne was the grandson of Thomas Hoyne, victor of the voided 1876 election The 1891 Chicago mayoral election saw two relatives run against each other. Republican candidate Hempstead Washburne and Citizens candidate Elmer Washburn (former Director of the United States Secret Service and former Chicago Police Chief) were both members of the Washburn family. Elmer Washburn was cousins with Hempstead Washburne's father Elihu B. Washburne. Hempstead Washburne ultimately won the election, with Elmer Washburn coming in fourth-place.\n\n In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Washington's first term in office directed attention to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re‑elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack soon after. Washington was succeeded by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer, who was elected by the Chicago City Council and served until a special election. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development, as well as closing Meigs Field in the middle of the night and destroying the runways. After successfully running for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term. In 1992, a construction accident near the Kinzie Street Bridge produced a breach connecting the Chicago River to a tunnel below, which \n\n Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, became mayor in 1989, and was repeatedly reelected until he declined to seek re-election in 2011. He sparked debate by demolishing many of the city's vast public housing projects, which had deteriorated and were holding too many poor and dysfunctional families. Concepts for new affordable and public housing have changed to include many new features to make them more viable: smaller scale, environmental designs for public safety, mixed-rate housing, etc. New projects during Daley's administration have been designed to be environmentally sound, more accessible and better for their occupants. In 2011, Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago. Since the 1990s, \n\n In the Chicago mayoral election of 1975, Richard J. Daley was elected to a record sixth term as mayor by a landslide 59% margin. This was the first Chicago mayoral election since the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Only one other individual (Daley's son Richard M. Daley) has matched Daley's feat of winning six Chicago mayoral elections.\n\n In the Chicago mayoral election of 1971, Richard J. Daley was elected to a fifth term as mayor, defeating Republican Richard Friedman by a landslide 40% margin. In winning his fifth mayoral election, Daley tied the record set by both Carter Harrison Sr. and Carter Harrison Jr. for the most Chicago mayoral election victories. He also became the first individual elected to five consecutive terms as Mayor of Chicago. Daley faced weak opposition in the election, with no serious challengers arising. This was the final Chicago mayoral election to be held before the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Thus, it was the final Chicago mayoral election in which the voting age was 21.\n\nQuestion: Richard Daley was mayor of which city for 21 years?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As an actor early in his career he was one of the 'Ghosts' in the 1922 silent film Three Live Ghosts alongside Norman Kerry and Cyril Chadwick. Also in the early 1920s he wrote several screenplays for star Mae Murray for films directed by her then husband Robert Z. Leonard. Goulding is best remembered for directing cultured dramas such as Love (1927), Grand Hotel (1932) with Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford, Dark Victory (1939) with Bette Davis, and The Razor's Edge (1946) with Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power. He also directed the classic film noir Nightmare Alley (1947) with Tyrone Power and Joan Blondell, and the action drama The Dawn Patrol.

It is said that Kirkpatrick met the Bruce rushing out of the church exclaiming that he thought he had killed Comyn and that Kirkpatrick then drew his dagger with the words, I mak sikkar; meaning “I make sure”; the clan motto and chief's coat of arms allude to this story. Kirkpatrick was sent on an embassy in 1314 with Sir Neil Campbell of Clan Campbell into England and in recompense the Kirkpatrick family received the lands of Redburgh. Sir Roger Kirkpatrick distinguished himself in 1355 when he took both Caerlaverock Castle and Dalswinton Castle from the English. In 1357 Kirkpatrick was murdered by his kinsman, Sir James Lindsay of Clan Lindsay in a private quarrel. The title then passed through a nephew to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, who in 1409 received from Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany the baronies of Closeburn and Redburgh.\n\n Lieber was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1959 and “spent much of his childhood building – and breaking – stereos, cars and model airplanes.” Since 2007 he has grown giant pumpkins in his front and back yards in Lexington, Massachusetts.

His 1,870-lb pumpkin in 2014 was named the largest pumpkin in Massachusetts and ranked 17th largest in the world that year. In 2020, the year of his arrest, he grew a 2,276-lb pumpkin that currently holds the record for the largest ever grown in Massachusetts.\n\n In 1984 Mike saw a 612 lb pumpkin at California's Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival. At the time it was the heaviest pumpkin ever grown. Mike contacted a grower for seeds and planted them. The following year, Mike had large Atlantic Giant pumpkins, but nothing to do with them. So he carved one. Word of his talent spread, and in 1986 he returned to Half Moon Bay as the festival's \"official\" pumpkin carver. He continues to hold that position and has carved at the festival for more than 20 years. Farmer Mike is sometimes called the Pumpkin Picasso or the Picasso of the Pumpkin Patch.

There he published different comic book characters’ stories. In 1951, his first book Das betrunkene Eichhorn, signed as Pericle Giovannetti, was published by the Vineta Verlag publishing house. In 1952, he produced an illustrated children's book for the Swiss Union of Free Trade Unions as a Christmas gift. In 1953, Giovannetti created Max the Marmot, the main character of the homonymous comic strips with no texts, for all ages, which brought him international fame: the cartoon character soon became popular, especially in Europe, the United States and Japan. The book Max was reprinted in 25 editions between 1954 and 2004, the reprints of \n\n In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were John Leech, George Cruikshank, Dickens illustrator Hablot Knight Browne, and, in France, Honoré Daumier. All contributed to both satirical and \"serious\" publications. At this time, there was a great demand for caricature drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes. The British humorous magazine Punch (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's Comic Almanac (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators. Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to John Leech being known as the world's first \"cartoonist\". In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian Le Voleur, Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.\n\n  Curzon Street Baroque is a 20th-century inter-war Baroque revival style. It manifested itself principally as a form of interior design popular in the homes of Britain's wealthy and well-born intellectual elite. Its name was coined by the English cartoonist and author Osbert Lancaster, as Curzon Street in Mayfair was an address popular with London high society. While previous forms of Baroque interior design had relied on French 18th-century furnishings, in this form it was more often than not the heavier and more solid furniture of Italy, Spain, and southern Germany that came to symbolise the furnishings of new fashion. While in vogue, roughly between 1927 and 1939, Curzon Street Baroque was also disparagingly known as \"Buggers' Baroque\" or \"Decorators' Baroque\". This was, according to author Jane Stevenson, because \"a statistically implausible number of important men and women, and their decorators in the interwar arts, were gay\". Among them were many of the leading writers, poets, and designers who used and promoted the style.\n\n cartoonist. Punch was discouraging about his work, but in 1958 he succeeded in placing work with the \"William Hickey\" column in the Daily Express. Although in regular work, he left the Express after five years, seeing no prospects being in competition with Osbert Lancaster and Giles. In 1962 he began producing his trademark \"little man\" character for the Sunday Telegraph, and in 1979 he brought this as a regular and long-running contribution to The Times. Additionally, he made contributions to Cosmopolitan and House & Garden, as well as publishing some 20 books of his cartoons. He was married twice, \n\n In 2008 the architectural historian Gavin Stamp described Osbert Lancaster's Pillar to Post (1938)—later revised and combined with the sequel Homes Sweet Homes (1939)—as \"one of the most influential books on architecture ever published–and certainly the funniest\". Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\" Lancaster, no doubt, intended his description of the new Baroque interiors as 'Curzon Street' to be a gentle criticism, suggesting they were lightweight compared to the original form. He disparaged and renamed other forms of contemporary architecture too, with titles such as Bankers' Baroque, Stockbroker Tudor, and By-pass Variegated.

There were to be three phases: the first a north–south line from Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok's main train station, to Don Mueang International Airport; the second an east–west line from Taling Chan District to Hua Mak; and the third a spur to the port. Totaling 60 km, all three were to be built on top of existing SRT train \n\n Taoyuan International Airport Skytrain is a people mover system that runs between the two passenger terminal buildings at the Taoyuan International Airport. The system consists of two parallel tracks, North and South, each providing bidirectional service. The north track is served by a single car for passport controlled passengers only. The south track serves both passport controlled passengers and the general public, separated by platform dividers between the cars. An extension is underway towards the future third terminal building, at which time the skytrain service will be limited to airport staff and passport-checked passengers only. The Taoyuan Airport MRT is to serve general public access between the terminals, the Airport Hotel, and the Taoyuan-Taipei area.\n\n The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens which travel up to 80 km/h. Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. The Blue Line has a large depot located on the large MRTA Headquarters in Huai Khwang district and accessed via a spur line located between Phra Ram 9 and Thailand Cultural Centre stations. The 48-kilometer-long MRT Blue line will serve as a circle line for Bangkok's metro rail system, providing connections to all other major lines, including the SRT Red Lines and the Airport Rail Link. However the complete track does not form a circle, but rather a figure 6.

Its southern march reached 88°23'S, a new Farthest South record 97 geographical miles from the Pole before having to turn back.

Robert Falcon Scott had also returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the Terra Nova Expedition, in a race against Amundsen to the Pole. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold. In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the Endurance, was frozen in pack-ice and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.\n\n  Between December 1911 and January 1912, both Roald Amundsen (leading his South Pole expedition) and Robert Falcon Scott (leading the Terra Nova Expedition) reached the South Pole within five weeks of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of human life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.\n\n  The prize of the Heroic Age was to find and reach the South Pole. Two expeditions set off in 1910 to attain this goal; a party led by Norwegian Polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram and Robert Falcon Scott's British group from the Terra Nova. Amundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier. Scott and his four companions reached the South Pole via the Beardmore route on 17 January 1912, 33 days after Amundsen. All five died on the return journey from the Pole, through a combination of starvation and cold. The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was later named after these two men.\n\n Roald Amundsen reached the Pole in December 1911, following a race with the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott.

The formation of the organization was prompted by the disclosure of the My Lai Massacre on November 12, 1969 by Seymour Hersh, writing for the New York Times. The group was the first to bring to public attention the testimony of American Vietnam War veterans who had witnessed or participated in atrocities.\n\n Tien 40 was conducted by the ARVN 23rd Division in Quang Duc Province. The operation resulted in 1,012 PAVN/VC killed. The story of the 1968 My Lai Massacre was revealed to the public by freelance American investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, who was contributing to the Dispatch News Service. The New York Times published a similar report at the same time. RVNAF fighter-bombers supporting ARVN forces at Bu Prang Camp hit both ARVN and PAVN forces in an airstrike killing 20 ARVN and an estimated 95 PAVN. Police used tear gas against protesters marching on the South Vietnamese embassy in Washington \n\n military-issued camera and color shots of the massacre with his personal camera. Although the operation appeared suspicious to Calley's superiors, it was forgotten. In 1969, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh exposed the My Lai massacre in print, and the Haeberle photos were released to the world media. The Pentagon launched an investigation headed by General William R. Peers to look into the allegations. After a flurry of activity, the Peers Commission issued its report. It declared that \"an atmosphere of atrocity\" surrounded the event, concluding that a massacre had taken place and the crime had been covered up by the commander of the Americal Division and his executive officer. Perhaps 400 Vietnamese civilians, mostly old men, women, and children had been killed by Charlie company. Several men were charged \n\nQuestion: Which journalist first told the world about the My Lai massacre?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the 13 years that Beemer played the title character, he was required by contract to restrict his radio acting to that one role until the program left the air. The experienced and popular Western film actor, Clayton Moore, was chosen to take over the role for the television series. Although Beemer had the right voice and had made many public appearances as the Ranger, he had no experience as a film actor, as he preferred live action to television. However, Beemer's voice as the character was so familiar that Moore imitated his sound in the earliest TV episodes.\n\n Walker, Texas Ranger is an American action crime television series created by Leslie Greif and Paul Haggis. It was inspired by the film Lone Wolf McQuade, with both this series and that film starring Chuck Norris as a member of the Texas Ranger Division. The show aired on CBS in the spring of 1993, with the first season consisting of three pilot episodes. Eight full seasons followed with new episodes airing from September 25, 1993, to May 19, 2001, and reruns continuing on CBS until July 28, 2001. It has been broadcast in over 100 countries and spawned a 2005 television film entitled Trial by Fire.

It was an attempt by The WB to revive the Lone Ranger franchise for a new generation. The character first appeared in 1933 in a radio show conceived either by WXYZ (Detroit) radio station owner George W. Trendle,  or by Fran Striker, the show's writer. The radio series proved to be a hit and spawned a series of books (largely written by Striker), an equally popular television show that ran from 1949 to 1957, comic books, and several movies. The film, intended as a pilot for a new television series, stars Chad Michael Murray as the Lone Ranger (the name of the Ranger's secret identity was changed from \"John Reid\" to \"Luke Hartman\") and Nathaniel Arcand as his Native American companion Tonto.\n\nJohn Reid / Lone Ranger: A youthful, scrupulous lawyer later deputized a Texas Ranger, who protects his identity as the \"Lone Ranger\", a masked vigilante who seeks the perpetrators responsible for his brother's death. ; Tonto: The aged narrator of the events of his life as a Comanche who recruited John Reid to bring justice to those responsible for massacring his tribe during his childhood, and terrorizing frontier Texas settlements during the 1800s.

Previous titles had included If You See Kay (a pun on the spelling of \"fuck\") and Genital Ben, accompanied by a bear on the cover of the album (a reference to Gentle Ben). Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions. The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when a young kid walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he \"take off [his] pants and jacket.\" Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would \"hook him up\". Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. \n\n McMahon told Barry Divola from Stars of Oz that Ben is characterised as a \"lovely guy, he's very honest, very open.\" In the 1992 Home and Away Annual, Kesta Desmond and David Nicholls described Ben as being \"relaxed\" and \"easy-going\" for a twenty-one-year-old male. Ben is an Italian character and comes from a large family. Ben's lifelong friend was Dave Porter (John Adam) and he helped Ben through school as he suffered racist taunts because of his ethnicity. He used to have a liking for partying and booze, but as he grew older he matured and changed his outlook in life. In his backstory, the character was only moderately successful academically, preferring to participate in sports. \n\nBen, a character in the 2009 American romantic comedy-drama movie He's Just Not That Into You ; Ben, a rat in the eponymous movie, and theme song sung by Michael Jackson on his LP Ben ; Benjamin Florian/Ben, a protagonist of the Descendants franchise (2015–2019) ; Gentle Ben, a bear featured in an eponymous 1965 novel, and in television and movie adaptations ; Ben Harper, major character on comedy series My Family ; Ben Kenobi, major character in the film saga, Star Wars ; Ben Lawson/BEN, an antagonist of the Ben Drowned series (2010-20) ; Ben, or Benny, the \"1980-something space guy\" from The Lego Movie ; Old Ben, a bear at the center of the William Faulkner story The Bear ; Ben Packer, one of the five main protagonists \n\n Greg Daniels, the writer of the episode, originally pitched this episode as being more centered on Lisa's and Homer's opposing ideas on feminism. Eventually, the episode became more of a satire of the media and television shows like Hard Copy. David Mirkin, the show runner at the time, felt very strongly about the \"tabloidization of the media\" and has said that the episode was as current in 2005 as it was at the time and things have since gotten worse. Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as creating a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show \"Ben\", which is hosted by a bear named \"Gentle Ben\" wearing a microphone on its head, reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. Dennis Franz was the writers' second choice for the actor who plays Homer in the television dramatisation. According to the DVD commentary, the original actor was more \"barrel chested\".\n\n Hilfenhaus, of German ancestry, is an avid golfer with an eight handicap and was Mr September in the McGrath Foundation's 2009 Men of Cricket calendar.

The series is built around the concept of a black family, the Cumberbatch Family, moving into the former Queens home of Archie Bunker after Bunker had sold the house located at 704 Hauser Street.\n\n Norman Lear created the series during the time when conservative talk radio was experiencing its initial upswing in popularity in the United States, particularly in the form of Rush Limbaugh. Lear felt that the time was right for a new show explore new issues, making 704 Hauser even more explicitly political than All in the Family. John Amos, a veteran of the earlier Lear sitcom Good Times (itself a spin-off of the All in the Family spin-off Maude), starred as Ernie Cumberbatch, while Lynnie Godfrey played his wife, Rose. The show features a reversal of the original All in the Family formula. Ernie and Rose Cumberbatch are working class Democrats, while their son Goodie is a conservative activist and his girlfriend, Cherlyn Markowitz (Maura Tierney), is white and Jewish.

Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, class, education, women's equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam War, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed.

The critics' reactions varied; Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press called it \"a half hour of vulgarity and offensive dialogue\" with \"little humor and considerable embarrassment\" and of The New York Times observed Archie Bunker's remarks and said \"None of these \n\n The series was based broadly on the 1970s U.S. sitcom All in the Family, by Norman Lear, and on its 1960s British antecedent, Till Death Us Do Part.

Ullman's version of the song later charted one place higher in the UK, peaking at No. 81 in January 1985. Ullman's version uses the same backing track as MacColl's, merely erasing MacColl's lead vocal and substituting Ullman's. (MacColl co-produced both versions of \"Terry\".) Speaking of the song's titular character, MacColl told Smash Hits in 1983: \"Terry seems to be a really good name for a lovable rogue. He's similar to the Marlon Brando character in On the Waterfront. She thinks he's the greatest thing since Elvis.\"\n\n The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop music composer Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach's frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit went to Minnelli's ex-husband, Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager: the line \"When you get caught between the moon and New York City\" from the chorus was taken from an unreleased song Allen and Bayer Sager had previously written together. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The song won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Original Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2004 it finished at #79 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of the top tunes in American cinema.

The liner notes state that they were familiar to other musicians in the Las Vegas area. Jennings intended to gain for them a wider audience with this album. Three of the songs on the album are written or co-written by Harold Gay, one of the members. The album is best remembered for its version of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park,\" which rose to #23 on the Billboard country charts and won a Grammy for Best \n\n Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, A Tramp Shining, included the seven-minute hit song \"MacArthur Park\" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as \"MacArthur's Park\"). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also topped several music sales charts in Europe during the summer of 1968. \"MacArthur Park\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. A second album, also consisting entirely of music composed by Webb, The Yard Went on Forever, was released in 1969. In the 1973 TV special \"Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La\", after singing Webb's \"Didn't We\", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey. Then he proceeds to sing \"If I Could Go Back\", from the Lost Horizon soundtrack.\n\n \"MacArthur Park\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb that was recorded first by Irish actor and singer Richard Harris in 1968. Harris's version peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number four on the UK Singles Chart. \"MacArthur Park\" was subsequently covered by numerous artists, including a 1969 Grammy-winning version by country music singer Waylon Jennings and a number one Billboard Hot 100 disco arrangement by Donna Summer in 1978. In 1967, producer Bones Howe had asked Webb to create a pop song with different movements and changing time signatures. Webb delivered \"MacArthur Park\" to Howe with \"everything he wanted\", but Howe did not care for the ambitious arrangement and unorthodox lyrics and the song was rejected by the group the Association, for whom it had been intended.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the song MacArthur Park?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was recorded in 1965 by Petula Clark at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured drummer Bobby Graham and the Breakaways vocal group. Released as the follow-up to \"Downtown\", which it strongly resembles both in musical structure and the story conveyed by the lyrics, \"I Know a Place\" became Clark's second consecutive Top Ten hit in the United States, remaining on the charts for twelve weeks. Five of the twelve weeks on the US charts were spent in the Top Ten, the song's fourth week at No. 9, \n\nthe song's popularity mandates its inclusion in any concert Clark gives in the English-speaking world; Clark generally performs the song combining French lyrics with the English. ; the one published biography of Clark written to date (by Andrea Kon in 1983) is titled This Is My Song (W.H. Allen & Co. Ltd.). Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on \"Downtown\", her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. The two singles before \"This Is My Song\", \"Who Am I?\" and \"Colour My World\", had failed to reach the UK Top 50. This made the strong UK showing of \"This Is My Song\"—Clark's first single release since \"Downtown\" to be neither written nor produced by Hatch—the more remarkable. The follow-up single \"Don't Sleep in the Subway\" resumed the Clark/Hatch collaboration and was a UK hit (#12) but, like all Clark's releases after \"This Is My Song\", would fail to return her to the UK Top Ten. Despite Clark's reservations about the English version of \"This is My Song\":\n\n The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and the Breakaways vocal group. Clark introduced \"A Sign of the Times\" on The Ed Sullivan Show broadcast of 27 February 1966. The single would debut on the Billboard Hot 100 dated 26 March 1966 and reached its peak of #11 that 23 April. It peaked at #2 on Billboard's \"Easy Listening\" survey. Beginning with her American breakout, \"Downtown,\" Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. (The 1966 #23 UK hit \"You're the One\" was not released in the US.) \"A Sign of the Times\" became the most extreme example of this discrepancy by spending only one week – that of 27 April 1966 – in the UK Top 50 at #49. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: \"Who Am I?\" (US #21) and \"Colour My World\" (US #16) both failed to rank in the UK Top 50. \"A Sign of the Times\" was a hit in Australia (#11) and South Africa (#2).\n\n the forefront of the 1960s Britpop scene, particularly as the follow-up to \"Downtown\": \"I Know a Place\", had - despite reaching #3 US - only been a moderate UK hit (#17). Clark's next UK single \"You're the One\" would boost her UK chart profile considerably with a #23 peak but it would be the subsequent \"My Love\" - ironically a record the singer disliked - which would consolidate the stardom augured for Clark by \"Downtown\". The 1967 album release Pet Project by the Bob Florence Big Band features an instrumental version of \"Round Every Corner\", the album being devoted to songs associated with Petula Clark.\n\n While overall conforming to the hit formula Hatch had come up with for Clark with \"Downtown\" - and being especially reminiscent of Clark's 1965 #1 hit \"My Love - \"Colour My World\" acknowledged the sound of the later 1960s by featuring a riff played on the sitar. Recorded in New York City, \"Colour My World\" was rush released in December 1966 in an attempt to counteract the disappointing performance of Clark's preceding single \"Who Am I?\" which had fallen short of the US Top 20 and more seriously had become the first Petula Clark single since \"Downtown\" (1964) to not rank in the UK Top 50. Billboard magazine's original review of the song predicted it would make the top 20 of the Hot 100. \"Chalk up another chart topper in this intriguing Hatch-Trent rhythm number featuring the popular Indian sitar sound and exceptional Clark vocal work.\"\n\nQuestion: Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On the professional tour, Anderson competed in ITF circuit events and was most successful in doubles, with a best ranking of 124 in the world. She won eight ITF doubles titles with countrywoman Robyn Field and 13 in total. Her career was curtailed by a wrist injury, which caused her to miss much of 1990 and 1991. From 1994 to 1997 she played college tennis in the United States for the University of Georgia. A four-time doubles All-American, she was a member of Georgia's NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Championship winning team in 1994.

This left only a few seconds of film before Jimi began his set. All that remains of that historic night are seconds of a video of Jimi plugging into his amps, pictures taken by few professional photographers, and a horrible distorted audio recording that's barely audible. By most eyewitness accounts, the Harlem crowd was slow to warm up to Jimi, with someone even throwing an object on stage. Once Jimi got into his performance, he won the crowd over and put on a great show.\n\n Hendrix's performance as \"a staggering display of blues guitar playing that is worthy of mention in the same breath as his later efforts with the Experience\". Although Shadwick compares his guitar tone and phraseology to that of Buddy Guy, he adds that his techniques \"simply transcend any previous models, and breaks new ground\" and shows that \"his ability to spin out long and consistently surprising lines across the standard blues changes is already full grown\". In 1966, during his residency as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha? in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became \"Red House\".\n\n Despite its studio complexity, \"Are You Experienced?\" was performed live by Experience several times in 1967 and 1968. It was used as the closing number at a Saville Theatre show in London on June 4, 1967. According to a review by Disc and Music Echo, the rendition of the Are You Experienced was \"smashing [and] ear splitting\". Hendrix \"ended the gig by smashing a guitar handed to him for the finale ... and hurling it into the audience\". The show was dubbed a \"farewell\" concert by Shapiro and Glebbeek, before the band headed to the US and their appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. A performance recorded at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, on October 10, 1968, was released on the 1982 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts album. A second performance on October 11 was included on a bonus disc for Live at Winterland, with Virgil Gonzales' flute part edited out. In 2011, the song was included on the Winterland box set.\n\n Pop Festival. In an effort to out-do the Who's destruction of their instruments earlier at the same event, Hendrix poured lighter fluid over his guitar and set it on fire, even though \"I'd just finished painting it that day\" as he would later remark. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine included this in their list of \"50 Moments That Changed Rock & Roll\" alongside Townshend's first guitar smashing in 1964. Instrument destruction has also featured in other musical genres than pop and rock music. Towards the end of Peter Maxwell Davies's monodrama Eight Songs for a Mad King, first performed in 1969, the vocalist seizes the violin from one of the musicians and smashes it.\n\n The Jimi Hendrix Experience gave a dramatic performance of the song, at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967: in the documentary Monterey Pop, Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the song's conclusion. Live recordings by Hendrix are found on several albums; more recently, the Monterey version is included on Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001) and Live at Monterey (2007). Also in 1967, the novelty team of Senator Bobby released a version of \"Wild Thing\". Comedian Bill Minkin sang it in the verbal style of Democratic Senator Bobby Kennedy, while a recording engineer is heard giving instructions. The single reached number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

He agreed to do the Mason movie if Barbara Hale returned to reprise her role as Della Street. Hale agreed, and when Perry Mason Returns aired in December 1985, her character became the defendant. The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale's real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake, Jr. The movie was so successful that Burr made a total of 26 Perry Mason television films before his death.

Her vocal performance on the song is similar to that of a group act rather than that of a solo artist. She claims that the track's sound was a product of Xenomania's pop music experience and her lyrical ideas. While the song was being crafted she was influenced by rock bands Kings of Leon and Jet, \"I wrote with [Xenomania] who are totally different to me and came from a totally different musical background, they had worked with a lot of pop acts before and at the time I was listening to a lot of Jet and Kings of Leon, so when both our ideas met we came up with something pretty good.\" Musically, the song has been compared to Amy Winehouse's 2007 single, \"Rehab\", for their similar composition, soul and swing musical influences.\n\n Jenny Owen Youngs (born November 22, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter.

The lyrics concern a bitter end to a relationship, although she delivers them with considerable humor.\" Eric McClary of the Reno Gazette-Journal wrote, \"The intensely personal attacks of 'Innocence' and 'The End of a Perfect Day' are more cleverly couched in falsely lighthearted music, and therefore they pack a more devastating punch.\" In a retrospective review of the song, Stewart Mason of AllMusic wrote, \"The deceptively savage 'Innocence' kicks off Kite in a breezily subversive manner, setting a lyric of immense emotional violence to an upbeat and bouncy tune with an icily ironic singalong chorus. The lyrics are so plainly mean-spirited that even Elvis Costello circa 1978 would feel sorry for her victim.\"\n\n Recording of Lessons to Be Learned, the parent album of \"Sweet About Me,\" began in Melbourne, Australia, when Gabriella Cilmi was thirteen years-old.

With Ang Tharkay as sirdar and twelve Sherpas, the main party departed Jogbani on 27 August 1951; the New Zealanders caught up with them on 8 September at Dingla. Hillary was nervous about meeting Shipton, the most famous living Himalayan mountaineer, and was worried his own colonial upbringing might not be up to the standards expected by the English. He wrote later \"As we came into the room, four figures rose to meet us. My first feeling was one of relief. I had rarely seen a more disreputable bunch, and my visions of changing for dinner faded away for ever\".\n\n MacInnes was exposed to mountaineering at a very early age and by the age of 16, he had already climbed the Matterhorn. He had also built a motor car from scratch at the age of 17. In 1953, when he was 23, he made an attempt to scale Mount Everest, with his friend John Crabbe Cunningham and had almost made it before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay scaled the mountain. He went on to complete the first winter ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct and of Raven's Gully on Buachaille Etive Mòr in the Scottish Highlands, with Chris Bonington in 1953. He was also a part of the group that scaled the Bonatti Pillar on \n\n Bryant resumed teaching in the South Island and in 1938 made the first ascent of Mount Cook by its east ridge. That year he took a Carnegie Educational Fellowship at London University, returning to New Zealand teaching for most of World War II. He got married in 1941 and in 1946 was appointed head teacher at an Auckland high school. Although further from the mountains, he continued climbing and taking pupils on expeditions. He wrote a book New Zealanders and Everest, published in 1953. In 1957 Bryant was killed in a road traffic accident. In 1951 Shipton was appointed as leader of another reconnaissance of the Everest approaches, this time from Nepal. Remembering Bryant's climbing skills and good humour, which he ascribed to his New Zealand heritage, and hearing of Ed Hillary's success on his first Himalayan expedition, he invited Hillary to join the party. It was Hillary's success there that led to his inclusion in the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition.\n\n Peter Edmund Hillary (born 26 December 1954) is a New Zealand mountaineer, philanthropist and writer. He is the son of adventurer Sir Edmund Hillary, who, along with mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, completed the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. When Peter Hillary summited Everest in 1990, he and his father were the first father/son duo to achieve the feat. Hillary has achieved two summits of Everest, an 84-day trek across Antarctica to the South Pole, and an expedition guiding astronaut Neil Armstrong to land a small aircraft at the North Pole. He has climbed many of the world's major peaks, and on 19 June 2008, completed the Seven Summits, reaching the top of the highest mountains on all seven continents, when he summited Denali in Alaska.\n\n Thumb. Sir Hillary was conscripted into the Royal New Zealand Air Force during World War II. He served as a navigator aboard Catalina flying boats in New Zealand's No. 5 Squadron based at the flying boat base in the Suva Point neighborhood, currently the location of the University of the South Pacific's Lower Campus. He made two attempts to climb Joske's Thumb, the first of which ended before reaching the base of the mountain, due to heavy undergrowth. In his autobiography, Sir Hillary wrote about his second attempt to climb Joske's Thumb while stationed in Suva: \"We had come up the wrong side — underneath the ball of The Thumb....

After Jack's sudden death in 1898, Isabella realized their shared dream of building a museum for their treasures. She purchased land for the museum in the marshy Fenway area of Boston, and hired architect Willard T. Sears to build a museum modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice. Gardner was deeply involved in every aspect of the design, though, leading Sears to quip that he was merely the structural engineer making Gardner's design possible.

However, the RRP re-attributed the painting to Rembrandt again in its corpus published in 2015, in which it is called Portrait of a couple in an interior. X-ray examination of the painting reveals that Rembrandt originally painted a child leaning on the seated lady's leg. Art historians speculate that the child died young and that the couple asked for the image to be painted out so as not to bring back painful memories. Bernard Berenson purchased the painting on behalf of collector Isabella Stewart Gardner. It hung in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, prior to being stolen on March 18, 1990. Following the theft, the painting has not resurfaced. A reward is offered for the return of the stolen items.\n\n Anne Hawley was the Norma Jean Calderwood Director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts from 1989 until 2015. Founded in 1903 and one of Boston's most important cultural institutions, the museum is a highly unique installation of Gardner’s private collection, considered to be a work of art in totality. Hawley stepped down from the position at the end of 2015 with plans to continue working with artists and the artistic community. She has been named a Resident Fellow at Harvard's Institute of Politics, beginning in spring 2016.\n\n18 March – Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft: Twelve paintings, collectively worth from $100 to $300 million, are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts by two thieves posing as police officers.

Hawley made it her mission to ensure that the institution would not only preserve Isabella Stewart Gardner’s extraordinary collection, but also serve as a dynamic cultural resource for artists, musicians, scholars, visitors, and the Greater Boston community, just as it did in Mrs. Gardner’s day. Modeled after a Venetian palazzo, the galleries surround a verdant courtyard and are home to paintings, sculptures, textiles, furniture, books, journals and letters, that seek to inspire generations of artists and visitors. Included in the collection are masterpieces by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo, Whistler, and Sargent.

Pushkin International Airport ( Mezhdunarodny aeroport Sheremetyevo imeni A. S. Pushkina) is one of four international airports that serve the city of Moscow. It is the busiest airport in Russia, as well as the fifth-busiest airport in Europe. Originally built as a military airbase, Sheremetyevo was converted into a civilian airport in 1959. The airport was originally named after a nearby village, and a 2019 contest extended the name to include the name of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The airport comprises six terminals: four international terminals (one under construction), one domestic terminal, and one private aviation terminal. It is located 29 km northwest of central Moscow, in the city of Khimki, Moscow Oblast. In 2017, the airport handled about 40.1 million passengers and 308,090 aircraft movements. During 2018, the airport reported a 14.3% increase in passengers for a total of 45.8 million. There was also a 15.9% increase in aircraft traffic year over year. Sheremetyevo serves as the main hub for Russian flag carrier Aeroflot and its branch Rossiya Airlines, Nordwind Airlines and its branch Pegas Fly, Royal Flight, and Ural Airlines.\n\n Expansion of the passenger terminal, cargo space, hangar, the runway and construction of the hotel is currently being completed by Chinese state-owned companies. The expansion work is being undertaken in two phases on an 80-hectare site. The first phase of the expansion work had enabled the airport to accommodate 15 additional aircraft, reducing traffic congestion at the airport. The second phase of the expansion work will enable the airport to service 10 additional aircraft. The airport will be able to service a total of 44 aircraft upon the completion of the expansion. The airport also plans to expand the apron which purportedly can solve the persistent aircraft parking problem it faces particularly during large international conferences. In 2012, expansion of the new passenger terminal was announced. The outlay of this expansion was projected at $250 million. At the same time, a new ramp was completed \n\n The former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn had purportedly given permission to build a new international airport in the town of Mojo, 65 kilometers south of the capital's current airport. The senior official at the Ethiopian Airport Enterprise said that the officials of the enterprise and the Ministry of Transport briefed the Prime Minister about the planned grand airport project.

The river runs approximately 273 miles (439 km) long, in the U.S. state of Illinois. This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The Illinois River meets the Mississippi at Pere Marquette State Park, which is near Grafton. The confluence of the rivers offers vistas that seem endless. The Illinois River is relatively shallow, just like the Mississippi. In addition, the Illinois River is a \"managed\" river, just as the Mississippi River is.

Angel Baby, 1995. Directed by Michael Rymer. The winner of seven Australian Film Institute awards for 1995, this film is a sensitive, realistic portrayal of love between two people with schizophrenia. Harry (John Lynch) is a regular at a local clubhouse. From the moment he sees Kate (Jacqueline McKenzie), he is smitten. He pursues and she responds. To the distress of his family, Harry moves out of his brother's home and Kate leaves her halfway house to move into an apartment together. Harry takes a job as a computer programmer and Kate does the neighbors' laundry, and their life is marginally successful until Kate becomes pregnant and they both stop taking their medication. Largely unnoticed in the United States, this film deals frankly with many important issues affecting those who suffer from serious mental illness: sexual relations, independent living arrangements, relationships with family members, noncompliance with medication, pregnancy, stigma, and suicide. Since a copy of Surviving Schizophrenia is shown in the movie, it ranks very high on my list! Shine, 1996. Directed by Scott Hicks. This highly successful movie, which garnered seven Academy Award nominations, depicts Australian pianist David Helfgott, afflicted with a severe mental disorder not named in the film but obviously schizophrenia.

The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through Sir Nigel Hawthorne's Sir Humphrey Appleby. The Thick of It, first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called \"the 21st century's answer to Yes Minister\". The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of special advisors), as well as the media's involvement in the process. There is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as John Milton, John Dryden, Andrew Marvell, Robert Burns, William Wordsworth and Anthony Trollope, and diarist Samuel Pepys.\n\n In a radio broadcast spoof of Yes Minister performed by both Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne, both of whom played their respective parts from the show, Hacker is a Minister in the government of the day, that of Margaret Thatcher, who also played herself as Prime Minister.

The single eventually hit number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, earning Parton a rare distinction: reaching the number one position twice with the same song.\n\n Billboard gave a positive review which said, \"The first single from The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas isn't the sort of brassy main theme normally used to launch a major movie musical: here Parton reinterprets one of her earliest exercises in pure pop writing, and while older fans may be divided over the breathier, more stylized reading she offers here, the song itself is still a lovely ballad with a soaring chorus.\" Cashbox also reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"hoisted over a building arrangement, Parton's vocals have never been more convincing or moving.

The song is the most popular song from the 1965 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha and is also featured in the 1972 film of the same name starring Peter O'Toole and is also featured in the 2021 film Nobody. The complete song is first sung by Don Quixote as he stands vigil over his armor, in response to Aldonza (Dulcinea)'s question about what he means by \"following the quest\". It is reprised partially three more times – the last by prisoners in a dungeon as Miguel de Cervantes and his manservant mount the drawbridge-like prison staircase to face trial by the Spanish Inquisition. A version recorded by Jack Jones peaked at No. 35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Leigh received the Contemporary Classics Award from the Songwriter's Hall of Fame for the song.\n\n In addition to stage and screen adaptations of the novel itself, Sancho Panza is a major character in the play within a play in the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha, and in the film of the same name.

For his 50th birthday in 1939, the day was declared a National Holiday. As part of these celebrations Hitler would receive numerous presents, among which were paintings and other art objects. These were set aside for use in the planned Führermuseum in Linz. Hitler's 56th birthday in 1945 was a private celebration held in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin as the Soviet Red Army battled to take the city; even under those circumstances, Hitler would frequently spend hours in the basement of the Chancellery looking at the scale model of the proposed rebuilding of Linz, which centered on the cultural district around the Fŭhrermuseum. Nine days after his birthday, Hitler married Eva Braun, and they committed suicide together the following day.\n\n By early 1945, Germany's military situation was on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945.

Exact figures from the RIAA are difficult to confirm, but in the press conference from September 22, 1958, originally released on the RCA Victor EP Elvis Sails in 1958 and included on disc four of the RCA CD boxed set The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters, the interviewer asked Presley for a tally of his gold records. Presley responded, \"I have 25 million sellers, and two albums that have sold a million each.\" Most of the songs in the compilation were recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, with other sessions at the RCA Victor studios in New York City, at 20th Century-Fox's Stage One in Hollywood, \n\n early 1930, Presley edited songbooks and was in charge of the mailing department for the Hartford Music Company in Hartford, Arkansas. He also worked fourteen years for the Central Music Company of Little Rock, Arkansas. However, he is most closely associated with the Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company, with whom Presley worked for the majority of his professional life spanning from 1930 until his death in 1974. Presley composed hymns for Stamps-Baxter while running a music supply store out of his home in Pangburn, Arkansas. At the time of his death, Presley was working for the Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company. He is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery near Rose Bud, Arkansas. For the decade following his death, his wife continued to operate the Stamps-Baxter Music store out of their home in Pangburn.\n\n Luther G. Presley was born on Beckett Mountain in Faulkner County, Arkansas on March 6, 1887. He studied music beginning at the age of 14, where he excelled. He soon became choir director. He wrote his first song, \"Gladly Sing,\" when he was 17. He furthered his study in singing and music, under renowned teachers. His first song was published in the Showalter-Patton Company songbook in 1907. Presley married Julia Magdaline \"Maggie\" Yingling of Clay, Arkansas in 1911. Together they had two sons before Maggie and their third child, another son, died in childbirth in 1922. In late 1923, Presley married Rena Henderson of Faulkner County. Henderson was also a songwriter who wrote many works of her own as well as authoring stories for children. The couple had one child together. From 1928 \n\n American singer and actor Elvis Presley rose to prominence in the mid-twentieth century, becoming a significant cultural icon due to his contributions to development of rock and roll music. Presley died in 1977 at his mansion, a 13.8-acre estate known as Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee. After his death, it was opened to the public as a museum in 1982, rapidly becoming one of the most popular domestic landmarks. It was once estimated that the museum attracts over 650,000 visitors per year—second only to the White House. Paul MacLeod was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1942. He worked in prisons and at automobile assembly plants, but he was unemployed for the majority of his life. He developed an obsession with Presley at a young age; by the mid-1970s, he had relocated to Holly Springs, Mississippi—only forty miles south of Graceland. He was married twice throughout his life, with both women divorcing him due to his fixation on Presley. He opened Graceland Too in 1989 or 1990, and it became a local tourist attraction.\n\n Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording \n\nQuestion: How old would Elvis Presley have been had he lived to the end of the 20th century?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Around 1931-32, the Bureau of Reclamation and Six Companies, Inc. constructed the housing in Boulder City for their department heads, engineers, and employees on the dam. Permits started to be issued by Sims Ely (City Manager) for building commercial buildings in the city from 1931. During 1932, the sight of north on Nevada Way towards the Bureau of Reclamation Building on the hill was quite similar to that of today. The management skills of Frank T. Crowe who was one of the most competent construction engineers to work in Reclamation caused the earlier completion of the dam in 1936, 22 months ahead of schedule.\n\n J. Strom Thurmond Dam, also known in Georgia as Clarks Hill Dam, is a concrete-gravity and embankment dam located 22 mi north of Augusta, Georgia on the Savannah River at the border of South Carolina and Georgia, creating Lake Strom Thurmond. U.S. Route 221 (and Georgia State Route 150 on the Georgia side of the state line) cross it. The dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1946 and 1954 for the purposes of flood control, hydroelectricity and downstream navigation. The concrete structure of the dam spans 1096 ft and rises 204 ft above the riverbed, housing a power plant with an installed 380 MW capacity. The Dam has prevented over $185,000 \n\n completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. The Hoover Dam is a massive concrete arch-gravity dam, constructed in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the US states of Arizona and Nevada between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression. In 1928, Congress authorized the project to build a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques \n\n On 21st December 1928, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Boulder Canyon Project Act approving the construction of Hoover Dam and the formation of Boulder City. Afterwards, on 11 March 1931, Six Companies, Inc., a company made up of 6 different construction companies, was offered the contract to build the dam. Boulder City was constructed for housing the workers who came to work on the dam. As the earliest developed experiment in new town planning in the 20th Century, Boulder City holds national significance. The federal government owned the site. All land was preserved by the federal government under the Bureau of Reclamation. The Boulder Canyon Project Federal Reservation as well as the federal rangers obeyed law \n\n Boulder City Historic District, is Nevada's largest listing on the National Register of Historic Places with 514 buildings. Among the buildings, 408 constructions were built during the first 11 years (from 1931 to 1942). Between World War II and 1950, 66 buildings were built; the rest 40 were constructed after 1950. Boulder City, Clark county, southeastern Nevada, U.S. is situated by the Hoover Dam. The only reason for its existence was the requirement of housing the employees hired to build the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. At the time of construction of the Dam, Boulder City sheltered more than 4,000 employees in 1500 buildings from 1931 to 1935.\n\nQuestion: In which river is the Boulder Dam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to this belief, he dropped dead of exhaustion shorty after arriving in Athens. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. After around 40 years of various distances, the 42.195 kilometer (26.2) mile trek became standard. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. With an increase in popularity, the scientific field has a large basis to analyze some of the physiological characteristics and the factors influencing these traits that led to Pheidippides's death. The high physical and biochemical demands of marathon running and variation across finishing times make for an intricate field of study that entangles multiple facets of human capacities.\n\n The St. George Marathon is an annual marathon sporting event hosted by the city of St. George, Utah on the first Saturday in October. The first race run was in November 1977. It was originated and organized in just a few months by Sherm Miller, who worked for the Parks and Recreation Department of St. George City. It is currently the 13th largest marathon in the United States of America.\n\n As all Olympic marathons, the competition was a single race. The 1908 course (the first Olympic marathon at the now-standard marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards) was not used. Instead, a course was designed that \"started and finished at Wembley Stadium, looping thru the London suburbs.\"\n\n The World Marathon Majors (WMM) (known for sponsorship reasons as the Abbott World Marathon Majors) is a championship-style competition for marathon runners that started in 2006. A points-based competition founded on six major marathon races recognised as the most high-profile on the calendar, the series comprises annual races for the cities of Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. In addition, each edition of the series recognises and includes the results of the major global championship marathon held in that year, usually on a one-off lapped course. These races are the biennial World Athletics Championships Marathon, and the quadrennial Olympic Games Marathon.\n\n The city is home to the Boston Marathon, one of the best known sporting events in the city. It is a 42.195 km run from Hopkinton to Copley Square in the Back Bay and the world's oldest annual marathon, running on Patriots' Day in April. The city is home to the Head of the Charles Regatta. Longwood Cricket Club (despite its name) is the oldest tennis club in the New World, located in Chestnut Hill. It is the site of the first Davis Cup competition.

Kallir has also sent Grandma Moses exhibitions to more than 30 venues in the U.S. and Japan. Her involvement with the artist continues a tradition that dates to Moses’ first one-person show, which took place at the Galerie St. Etienne in 1940.\n\n Belvedere, Vienna, it also houses the intriguing Vienna Undertakers' Museum, which contains more than 600 artifacts documenting the Viennese interest in death and burial. There are elaborate black uniforms and regalia worn by the pallbearers, from the French pompes funèbres, as well as hearses, wreaths, sashes, lanterns, torches, black flags, even an urn in the shape of a football and a “sitting coffin”. A real curiosity on display in the Bestattungsmuseum is the re-usable coffin instigated in 1784 by Emperor Joseph II, in an attempt to save wood and to hasten decomposition. The coffins were equipped with a trap underneath to drop the bodies in the graves and kept for another funeral.

After that, she only occasionally appeared in films, one being Robin and Marian (1976) with Sean Connery. Her last recorded performances were in the 1990 documentary television series Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role.

In addition to \"This Diamond Ring\", his hits include \"Count Me In,\" the only non-British Commonwealth record in the Hot 100's top 10 on May 8, 1965, (number two); \"Save Your Heart for Me\" (number two); \"Everybody Loves a Clown\" (number four); \"She's Just My Style\" (number three); \"Sure Gonna Miss Her\" (number nine); and \"Green Grass\" (number eight). Of \"Everybody Loves a Clown\", Lewis says he composed the song as a gift for his father's birthday. He believed the song was too good, so instead of giving it as a gift, he recorded it. By 1966, Lewis was exclusively singing, replaced on the drums by, among others, Jim Keltner. His career was put on hold when he entered the U.S. Army as a \n\n Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on the Lewis name, Garrett put the band into the studio to develop, still financed by Gary's mother. Garrett pushed Lewis to improve his drumming skill, even getting Buddy Rich to tutor him, and, more importantly, made Lewis the singer, and therefore the focal point of the group. By Lewis' own admission, his natural singing voice was not one of his strengths, and Garrett employed overdubbing techniques in the studio to enhance it. \"This Diamond Ring\" hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 20, 1965, making Lewis an instant star. Lewis was Cash Box magazine's 1965 \"Male Vocalist of the Year\". Besides The Lovin' Spoonful, the group was the only artist during the 1960s to have its first seven Hot 100 releases \n\n on many Phil Spector productions, including recordings by the Ronettes, the Crystals, and Darlene Love and in the 1963 A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector album. He can be seen in the 1964 concert film T.A.M.I. Show playing piano with the Wrecking Crew (an informal name for the top Los Angeles session musicians of the 1960s), sporting short, dark, slicked-back hair, in contrast to his later look. Soon after, he was hired as Snuff Garrett's assistant and creative developer, playing on numerous number-one singles, including \"This Diamond Ring\" by Gary Lewis & the Playboys. In the mid-1960s, he wrote or co-wrote songs, including two hits for Gary Lewis and the Playboys: \"Everybody \n\n \"This Diamond Ring\" is a 1965 song written by Al Kooper, Bob Brass and Irwin Levine. It was first recorded by Sammy Ambrose on Musicor #1061, then by Gary Lewis & the Playboys on Liberty #55756. Lewis' version charted first, #101 on the January 2, 1965, Billboard \"Bubbling Under\" chart. Both versions charted on January 9, Lewis still at #101 and Ambrose at #117. Ambrose dropped off the charts at that point, but Lewis made #65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the next week (January 16) and his version continued to climb until it reached #1 on February 20, 1965.\n\n Gary Lewis & the Playboys were an American 1960s era pop and rock group, fronted by musician Gary Lewis, the son of comedian Jerry Lewis. They are best known for their 1965 Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"This Diamond Ring\", which was the first of a string of hit singles they had in 1965 and 1966. The band had an earnest, boy-next-door image similar to British invasion contemporaries such as Herman's Hermits and Gerry and the Pacemakers.

It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines.  Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome.  Given the uncertain health effects of low-dose radiation, cancer deaths cannot be ruled out. However, studies by the World Health Organisation and Tokyo University have shown that no discernible increase in the rate of cancer deaths is expected. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged in the academic literature from none to hundreds.\n\nMany deaths are attributed to the evacuation and subsequent long-term displacement following emergency mass evacuation.  For evacuation, the estimated number of deaths during and immediately after transit range from 34 to \"greater than 50\". The victims include hospital inpatients and elderly people at nursing facilities who died from causes such as hypothermia, deterioration of underlying medical problems, and dehydration.\n\nFor long-term displacement, many people (mostly sick and elderly) died at an increased rate while in temporary housing and shelters.  Degraded living conditions and separation from support networks are likely contributing factors.  , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. \"Disaster-related deaths\" are deaths attributed to disasters and are not caused by direct physical trauma, but does not distinguish between people displaced by the nuclear disaster compared to the earthquake / tsunami.  As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. Reports have pointed out that many of these deaths may have been caused by the evacuation period being too long, and that residents could have been allowed to return to their homes earlier in order to reduce the total related death toll. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”.\n\nAt least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 175 (0.7%) have received significant radiation doses. Workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. After hearing opinions from a panel of radiologists and other experts, the ministry ruled that the man's family should be paid compensation.\n\nThe Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima.\n\nSummary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting). At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.\n\nAs the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.\n\nIn the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.\n\nConcerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.\n\nJapanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.\n\nRadiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\".\n\nReports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.\n\nUNSCEAR Report \nAnnex A of the UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee for the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2013 report to the UN General Assembly states that the average effective dose of the 25,000 workers over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 millisieverts (mSv).  About 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 35).  No radiation-related deaths or acute diseases have been observed among the workers and general public exposed to radiation from the accident (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 38).  Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30).  No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants (Chapter II A(b) paragraph 39).  Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29). For comparison, the average dose from an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, with and without contrast, is 20 to 30 mSv.\n\nWHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.\n\nThe WHO calculations using this model determined that the most at risk group, infants, who were in the most affected area, would experience an absolute increase in the risk of cancer (of all types) during their lifetime, of approximately 1% due to the accident. With the lifetime risk increase for thyroid cancer, due to the accident, for a female infant, in the most affected radiation location, being estimated to be one half of one percent [0.5%]. Cancer risks for the unborn child are considered to be similar to those in 1 year old infants.\n\nThe estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently[2013] ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture, this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.\nAbout one third of people [33.3%] in industrialized nations are presently diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes, radiation exposure can increase one's cancer risk, with the cancers that arise being indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes.\n\nNo increase is expected in the incidence of congenital or developmental abnormalities, including cognitive impairment attributable to within the womb radiation exposure. As no radiation induced inherited effects/heritable effects, nor teratogenic effects, have ever been definitely demonstrated in humans, with studies on the health of children conceived by cancer survivors who received radiotherapy, and the children of the Hibakusha, not finding a definitive increase in inherited disease or congenital abnormalities. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants.\n\nOther reports\n\nMajor news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from \"disaster conditions\" following the earthquake. \"The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\"\n\nA Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster.  They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone.\n\nOn 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.\n\nIn a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.\n\nThe wind measurably increased the radiation levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine, which can lead to increased risk of thyroid cancer if absorbed into the body, was released into the air along with other fission products. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodide is used, as it prevents the absorption of the potentially dangerous radioisotopes of that element. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high.\n\nAccording to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.\n\nIn April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the US, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.\n\n, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.\n\nWorkers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat. , 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded. In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure.\n\n, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases. A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.\n\nAccording to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by \"fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster\".\n\nAccording to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.\n\nThese numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.\n\nFinally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died.\nThose who have responded to this paper in the literature have noted a number of errors, among them that this figure was based on an assumption of acute deaths from low radiation doses. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster.\n\nThe author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. In their final 1981 report, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.\n\nAnother cause of death is the increased number of suicides due to mental stress, despair, anxiety and depression caused by media coverage, and through long periods of evacuation.\n\nPerinatal mortality in areas contaminated with radioactive substances started to increase 10 months after the nuclear accident relative to the prevailing and stable secular downward trend. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.\n\nSee also\n List of civilian nuclear accidents\n Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents\n Timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report website in English\n Executive summary of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission Report\n Fukushima report: Key points in nuclear disaster report – An outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report, as provided by the BBC, 5 July 2012\n Webcam Fukushima nuclear power plant I, Unit 1 through Unit 4\n Investigation Committee on the accidents at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company\n Schematic drawing of Unit 1 reactor building\n TEPCO News Releases, Tokyo Electric Power Company\n NISA Information update, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, the nuclear safety authority of Japan\n JAIF Information update, Japan Atomic International Forum\n JAEA Information update, Japan Atomic Energy Agency\n IAEA Update on Japan Earthquake, International Atomic Energy Agency\n Nature Journal – Specials: Japan earthquake and nuclear crisis\n TerraFly Timeline Aerial Imagery of Fukushima Nuclear Reactor after 2011 Tsunami and Earthquake\n Documentary photographs: residential damage within \"No Go\" Zone\n In graphics: Fukushima nuclear alert, as provided by the BBC, 9 July 2012\n PreventionWeb Japan: 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster   \n \"What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?\" by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n Evidence can be seen from the 1986 Chernobyl event. Due to the violent nature of accident in Chernobyl, a sizable portion of radioactive contamination resulted from the atmosphere were particles that where dispersed during the explosion. Many of these contaminates settled in groundwater systems in immediate surrounding areas, but also Russia and Belarus. Due to the resulting radiation in groundwater, the ecological effects of the disaster can be seen in various aspects down the environmental process line. Radionuclides carried by groundwater systems in and around the areas of Chernobyl have resulted in the uptake to plants in the region and up the food chains into animals, and eventually, humans – as one of the largest \n\n  The worst nuclear accident to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. The accident killed 31 people directly and damaged approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Estimates of eventual deaths from cancer are highly contested. Industry, UN and DOE agencies claim low \n\nThe Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine. From 1986 onward, the total death toll of the disaster has lacked consensus; as peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet and other sources have noted, it remains contested. There is consensus that a total of approximately 30 people died  from immediate blast trauma and acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the seconds to months after the disaster, respectively, with 60 in total in the decades since, inclusive of later radiation induced cancer. However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths that have yet to have occurred due to the disaster's long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 cases in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. Such numbers are based on the heavily contested Linear no-threshold model.\n\nThis no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Determining the elevated risk or total number of deaths from very low doses is completely subjective, and while much higher values would be detectable, lower values are outside the statistical significant reach of empirical science and are expected to remain unknowable.\n\nFrom model-based epidemiological studies, the incidence of thyroid cancer cases due to the accident by 2065 compared with other cancer-inducing sources (diet etc) across Europe, is roughly 1 in 10,000 as a probable worst-case scenario. Thyroid cancer is relatively amenable to treatment for several decades.  Attributing a 1% mortality rate by Tuttle et al to the 16,000 cases across Europe as predicted by Cardis et al results in a likely final total death toll from radiation-induced thyroid cancer of around 160.\n\nThere have been no validated increases in solid cancer reported from the liquidator cohorts. The liquidators were adult at exposure and the vast majority of them received doses under 100 mSv, which is lower than many expect.\n\nNote also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. This study used whole genome sequencing in a cohort of parent and child blood samples.\n\nDiffering direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. However, by late 1986, Soviet officials updated the official count to 30, reflecting the deaths of 28 additional plant workers and first responders in the months after the accident. In the decades since the accident, many former Soviet officials and some Western sources had also determined a total of 30 direct casualties.\n\nFor their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia.\n\n2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\".\n\nHowever—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context.\n\nOthers have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident.\n\nLiquidator mortality \n\nThe uncertain and contested mortality rate of the Chernobyl liquidators is a major factor in the lack of consensus on the Chernobyl disaster's accurate death toll. Following the disaster itself, the Soviet Union organized an effort to stabilize and seal off the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of an estimated 600,000 \"liquidators\" recruited or conscripted from all over the Soviet Union.\n\nSince the 1990s—when the declassification of selected liquidator records prompted some direct participants to speak publicly—some with direct involvement in the liquidators' cleanup efforts have asserted that several thousand liquidators died as a result of the cleanup. Other organizations claim that total liquidator deaths as a result of the cleanup operation may number at least 6,000.\n\nThe National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low.\n\nFor their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health.\n\nLong-latency diseases \nIssues related to identifying and tracking long-latency diseases have presented another stumbling block to reaching consensus on deaths beyond the immediate fatalities directly attributable to the initial reactor explosion and subsequent ARS. In the years since the accident, delayed, post-disaster deaths due to solid cancers, leukemia, and other long-latency diseases that might be attributable to the accident's release of radioactive debris have remained an ongoing concern. However, the streamlined standards, methods, and sustained research efforts needed to pinpoint, track, and tally such long-latency disease deaths have remained lacking—resulting in gaps in data and divergent estimates. There is consensus for only one form of long-term physiological effect: thyroid cancer in those who consumed radioactive iodine as children. This is because doses of radioiodine to the child's thyroid were much higher than other isotopes and the child's thyroid is still growing. Of those in the exposed cohort who have developed thyroid cancers, the proportion of cancers attributable to the Chernobyl incident is estimated to be between 7% and 50%. As there is no bio-marker for radiation induced thyroid cancer, the exact number of cases seen in the population cannot be determined.\n\nAddressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated based upon his team's research. In 2020, Hauptmann and many international scientists studying the numerous damages resulting from the \"low doses\" that have afflicted the populations of survivors of the explosions of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and also in numerous accidents of nuclear plants that have occurred in the world, concluded in an extensive meta-analysis that the new epidemiological studies directly support excess cancer risks from low-dose ionizing radiation; and Venturi has reported in Russian journal \"Biosfera\" a correlation between radioactive caesium and world increase of incidence and death for pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn compensation and payout legal terms, by 2005, the Ukrainian government  was providing survivors' benefits to 19,000 families \"owing to the loss of a breadwinner whose death was deemed to possibly related to the Chernobyl accident;\" by 2019, this figure had risen to 35,000 families. By 2016, some Ukrainian and Belarussian physicians charged with treating large numbers of former liquidators in the decades since the accident were calling for more comprehensive studies and urging that the IAEA's estimated toll of disaster-related deaths from long-latency diseases be revised upwards, claiming that their own data indicates a former liquidator death rate of several thousand per year as a result of diseases related to the disaster.\n\nGreenpeace have projected up to a million excess, cancer-related deaths from the Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl Forum, the WHO, and other international agencies do not accept this number.\n\nMethodological debates \nThe use of differing, contested methods to identify and tally deaths—including anticipated deaths due to long-latency diseases—has also contributed to the wide range of estimates of the Chernobyl disaster's death toll. As former IAEA head Hans Blix has recalled in interviews, such disagreement over various tabulation methods and the divergent death tolls that they yield has been a mainstay of efforts to estimate the disaster's total fatalities since international authorities' first attempts to establish a consensus death toll.\n\nIndeed, at the August 1986 meeting of the first international conference on the disaster, the IAEA scaled down from 40,000 to 4,000 the projected disaster-related deaths estimate of Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official commission—after objecting to Legasov's use of a statistical model based on radiation data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (It is this 4,000 figure from the 1986 conference's methodological debate that the IAEA cited as its rough estimate for 20 years before joining other United Nations agencies in 2005 and 2006 to make 4,000 the UN's official estimate of disaster-related deaths.) Similarly, some theoretical estimates of the disaster's deaths are disputed on the grounds that they rely upon contested models such as the linear no-threshold model (LNT) or hormesis in order to compare the disaster's estimated cancer rates to background rates of cancer.\n\nYet even estimated death tolls that have acknowledged and attempted to mitigate for such methodological debates have yielded a body of divergent estimates—including the Union of Concerned Scientists' 2011, LNT-model-based conclusion of 27,000 deaths due to the accident; the death toll of 93,000 to 200,000 that Greenpeace has posited since 2006; and Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment (published in 2007 by Russian affiliates of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, but without NYAS' explicit approval), which estimates 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity the accident released.\n\nSurviving evacuees' accounts \nSince 1986, officials have tended to discount as inaccurate, inexpert opinion the claims of some surviving Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve evacuees that their own observations of deaths attributable to the disaster are not reflected in official records and tallies. For example, authorities have long dismissed as 'urban legend' some Pripyat evacuees' claims of high death rates among fellow citizens who gathered on a railway bridge—the so-called 'Bridge of Death'—to watch the exploded reactor's blazing fire and glowing, electric blue column of ionized air in the midst of visible nuclear fallout on the night of the accident. This has never been substantiated, and at least one surviving witness has said they were on the bridge that night and are healthy.\n\nIndeed, some authorities have argued that post-disaster psychological trauma—sometimes characterized as Radiophobia or labeled a mental aspect of the collection of post-accident symptoms that some physicians term 'Chernobyl Syndrome'—has led some former residents of the region surrounding the plant to attribute deaths to the accident based on anecdotal evidence alone. In this vein, the Chernobyl Forum, the World Nuclear Association (WNA), and other groups posit an increase in psychological problems among those exposed to the disaster's radiation, due in part to poor communication of radiation's effects, disruption to their way of life, and trauma surrounding the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn response, some former residents of the region that now comprises the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve—including Lyubov Sirota, a Ukrainian poet and Pripyat evacuee, in her 1995, Chernobyl Poems verse, \"Radiophobia\", and her 2013 memoir, The Pripyat Syndrome—decry such questioning of survivors' psychology and discernment as efforts to dismiss and de-legitimize both evacuees' claimed long-term experience of the disaster's lethal impacts and evacuees' allegations of the accident's tangible, ongoing effects upon their physical health. In her 1988 poem, \"They Did Not Register Us (To Vasily Deomidovich Dubodel)\", Sirota addressed what she considers the failure of local and international authorities to recognize the disaster-related, long-latency disease deaths of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone evacuees and to reach consensus about how best to tally and study these deaths. She wrote:\n\nStill more controversially, some surviving Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve evacuees take particular issue with the longstanding position of constituent United Nations agencies to discount as misinformation, \"urban legend\", or radiophobia the claims of some evacuees that during the weeks and months directly after the accident, they witnessed more immediate disaster-related deaths due to trauma and radiation sickness that they argue are not reflected in the official record. For example, Nikolai Kalugin—an evacuee from a village now included in Belarus' Polesie State Radioecological Reserve—claimed to Newsweek in May 2019 that his daughter died in the weeks after the accident as the result of what he maintains were unrecorded local cases of radiation sickness:\n\nFor their part, the United Nations and some prominent Chernobyl disaster scholars continue to discount as mistaken or Radiophobic such evacuee claims of additional, short-term, direct deaths due to accident-attributable trauma or radiation sickness not counted in the official tallies of the accident's death toll.\n\nOfficial list of direct deaths \nThe 31 persons listed in the table below are those whose deaths the Soviet Union included in its official roster—released in the latter half of 1986—of casualties directly attributable to the disaster.\n\nSee also \n Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment\n Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\nAftermath of the Chernobyl disaster\nDeath in Ukraine\nChernobyl disaster\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine. From 1986 onward, the total death toll of the disaster has lacked consensus; as peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet and other sources have noted, it remains contested. There is consensus that a total of approximately 30 people died  from immediate blast trauma and acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the seconds to months after the disaster, respectively, with 60 in total in the decades since, inclusive of later radiation induced cancer. However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths that have yet to have occurred due to the disaster's long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 cases in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. Such numbers are based on the heavily contested Linear no-threshold model.\n\nThis no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Determining the elevated risk or total number of deaths from very low doses is completely subjective, and while much higher values would be detectable, lower values are outside the statistical significant reach of empirical science and are expected to remain unknowable.\n\nFrom model-based epidemiological studies, the incidence of thyroid cancer cases due to the accident by 2065 compared with other cancer-inducing sources (diet etc) across Europe, is roughly 1 in 10,000 as a probable worst-case scenario. Thyroid cancer is relatively amenable to treatment for several decades.  Attributing a 1% mortality rate by Tuttle et al to the 16,000 cases across Europe as predicted by Cardis et al results in a likely final total death toll from radiation-induced thyroid cancer of around 160.\n\nThere have been no validated increases in solid cancer reported from the liquidator cohorts. The liquidators were adult at exposure and the vast majority of them received doses under 100 mSv, which is lower than many expect.\n\nNote also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. This study used whole genome sequencing in a cohort of parent and child blood samples.\n\nDiffering direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. However, by late 1986, Soviet officials updated the official count to 30, reflecting the deaths of 28 additional plant workers and first responders in the months after the accident. In the decades since the accident, many former Soviet officials and some Western sources had also determined a total of 30 direct casualties.\n\nFor their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia.\n\n2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term.

J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. A light gangway was established where the railway platform used to be, allowing access to the platform from the side of the bridge.\n\n  The Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge spans the Kawarau River in the Otago region in the South Island of New Zealand. The bridge is mainly used for commercial purposes by the AJ Hackett Bungy Company for bungy jumping - the world's first commercial bungy jumping site. The bridge carries walkers, runners and bikers on the Queenstown Trail over the river.\n\n first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, England. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge in Colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular American television program That's Incredible! Bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers. The Club \n\n WildPlay Element Parks is a Canadian-owned chain of outdoor recreation parks located across British Columbia, Ontario and New York. It is based on Vancouver Island. WildPlay's first park was opened south of Nanaimo, British Columbia in March 2006 where the company operates North America's first legal, purpose-made bungee jumping bridge. The bridge stands 150 feet above the Nanaimo River; over 260,000 people have jumped since the site opened in 1990. The Nanaimo location hosts naked bungee jumping once a year as a fundraiser. Besides bungee jumping, WildPlay parks are made up of treetop activities involving high-ropes and obstacle climbing, swinging, and ziplining. WildPlay is located in Victoria, Maple Ridge, Nanaimo, Kelowna, British Columbia, Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Jones Beach State Park in New York.\n\n When A J Hackett opened the world's first commercial bungee jumping site at Kawarau Bridge near Queenstown, New Zealand, customers who performed the jump in the nude were granted free entry. This offer was later withdrawn because too many jumpers were taking advantage of it, but the site remains clothing-optional. Billy Connolly famously bungee-jumped nude from the bridge during his 2004 World Tour of New Zealand. Since 2006 there has been an annual naked bungee jump at WildPlay park on Vancouver Island as a fund raiser for the Victoria Branch of BC Schizophrenia Society. The 2019 event drew more than 100 participants.\n\nQuestion: In which country was the first permanent bungee jumping site situated?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Died: Nikita Khrushchev, 77, de facto leader of the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964, and de jure leader of the Soviet government from 1958 to 1964 as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.  The Soviet government acknowledged Khrushchev's death two days later with a small obituary in Pravda and an announcement by the TASS agency that said \"The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist party and the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. announce with sorrow that on Sept. 11, 1971, after a severe and long illness, the former First Secretary of the Central Committee and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, special pensioner Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, died in his 78th year.\"  \n\n Mikhail Gorbachev became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interregnum after the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 when the party was led first by Yuri Andropov and then by Konstantin Chernenko. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was the leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise stopgap candidate as Gorbachev – Andropov's protege – lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko \n\n Both the cultural and the political thaws were effectively ended with the removal of Khrushchev as Soviet leader in October 1964, and the installment of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1964. When Khrushchev was dismissed, Alexei Kosygin took over Khrushchev's position as Soviet Premier, but Kosygin's economic reform was not successful and hardline communists led by Brezhnev blocked any motions for reforms after Kosygin's failed attempt. Brezhnev's career as General Secretary began with the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial in 1965, which showed that an authoritarian ideology was being established. He approved the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Soviet–Afghan War which continued after his death. He installed an authoritarian regime that lasted throughout his premiership and that of his two successors, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.\n\n and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protégé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov.

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. Chernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years, and, upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who was seven months older than Chernenko and just over three years older than his predecessor Andropov, is reported to have remarked \"How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?\"\n\nQuestion: Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Another foundling wheel dating to at least 1601 is on display for visitors to Naples' Church of the Annunciata. In Hamburg, Germany, a Dutch merchant set up a wheel (Drehladen) in an orphanage in 1709. It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. Other wheels are known to have existed in Kassel (1764) and Mainz (1811). In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. Foundling wheels were \n\n A pram service is an informal Anglican Church religious service, such as eucharist or morning prayer, specifically tailored for babies and toddlers (up to five years of age), along with their parents, guardians, or child minders, and which is named for the British word for what Americans call a baby carriage. The short, informal service typically includes communion or prayer, singing, and age-appropriate Biblical stories, followed by a snack and hot beverages, play time, and informal conversation. The service may be led by the vicar, or, more often, by a layperson, or Mothers Union volunteer. The mothers may lead the service themselves. Women in the priesthood may have gotten their first experience leading religious services with such forms of worship.\n\n\"Hu (Boulter) Armach, Primate of All-Ireland, being in the chair, ordered that a turning-wheel, or convenience for taking in children, be provided near the gate of the workhouse; that at any time, by day or by night, a child may be layd in it, to be taken in by the officers of the said house.\"  Baby hatches have existed in one form or another for centuries. The system was quite common in medieval times. From 1198 the first foundling wheels (ruota dei trovatelli) were used in Italy; Pope Innocent III decreed that these should be installed in homes for foundlings so that \n\n A baby hatch or baby box is a place where people (typically mothers) can bring babies, usually newborn, and abandon them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century, but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches, Czech Republic (76), Poland (67), and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006. The hatch is known in German-speaking countries as a Babyklappe (baby hatch or flap), Babyfenster (baby window) or Babywiege (baby cradle); in Italian as Culla per la vita \n\n The first modern baby hatch was in South Africa in July 1999 and was installed by Door of Hope Children's Mission (Hole in the Wall) at a small mission church in Berea in Johannesburg. In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative. The church made a hole in their wall and a \"baby bin\" was installed allowing for mothers to leave their babies any time, day or night. The moment a baby is placed in the \"baby bin\" care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. The baby is taken in and the anonymity of the \"donor\" ensured.

The organisation grew from this protest, and demanded Objective One regional funding for Cornwall, an exclusively-Cornish European Parliament constituency, a Cornish university, support for Cornwall's traditional industries and local control over Cornwall's health service; these demands were broadly similar to those being made at the time by Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party that had recently relaunched itself. Cornish Solidarity was consolidated as a pressure group after the closure of South Crofty, the last hard rock mine in Cornwall, in March 1998. Greg Woods \n\n despite the pledges of residents. The government finally relented in 1977. By then, the population of Świdnik was well over 20,000. On July 8, 1980 a strike started in the WSK factory, which quickly spread to other factories in the Lublin region and brought the local economy to a standstill. The Communist government eventually managed to quell these mass protests by granting the workers many of their demands. However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland's Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement. During the Martial law \n\n In 1980, Andrzej Wieckowski assumed a leadership role in Solidarity at the University of Warsaw, a Polish non-governmental trade union, which over time evolved to become non-violent anti-communist social movement, generally viewed today as having greatly contributed to the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989–1990. He died on January 31, 2019, in Oregon, where he had retired.\n\n As the economic crisis became unbearable, the Communist government authorized an increase in food prices for the summer of 1980. Once again a revival of labor disturbances erupted throughout the nation. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers seized arsenals, took control of the shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the rights of freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion, as well as the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Walentynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.\n\n Solidarity (Solidarność, pronounced ), a Polish non-governmental trade union, was founded on August 14, 1980, at the Lenin Shipyards (now Gdańsk Shipyards) by Lech Wałęsa and others. In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-Communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. It is considered to have contributed greatly to the Fall of Communism. The People's Republic of Poland attempted to destroy the union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression but in the end was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks between the Communist government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections of 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and Wałęsa was elected president in December 1990. This was soon followed by the dismantling \n\nQuestion: In which city's shipyard was Solidarity set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He made his Broadway debut in 1904 in Richard Harding Davis's Ranson's Folly. He went on to appear in productions of William C. deMille's Strongheart; Glorious Betsy by Rida Johnson Young (the production lasted only 24 performances but the play was later adapted for an Oscar-nominated film of the same name); Bayard Veiller's The Fight (which quickly closed); Edgar Wallace's The Switchboard; Edward Locke's The Bubble; and Edgar Selwyn's Rolling Stones. Ford turned to film beginning in 1915 and moved to Hollywood. He became a leading man opposite stars such as Constance Talmadge, Norma Talmadge, Marie Prevost, Marion Davies, Marguerite De La Motte and Clara Bow. Ford's film career ended with the advent of talkies. His final film, and only talkie, Love in High Gear, was released in 1932. He returned to acting in the theatre, and also directed productions at the Little Theater of the Verdugos in Glendale, California. During World War II, he toured with the United Service Organizations (USO).\n\nHarrison Ford as Indiana Jones: The archaeologist professor and adventurer, who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?\" ; River Phoenix as a younger Indiana Jones. Phoenix had portrayed the son of Ford's character in The Mosquito Coast (1986). Ford recommended Phoenix for the part; he said that of the young actors working \n\n Ford married New York stage actress Beatrice Prentice (1884–1977) on March 29, 1909. On September 13, 1951, he was struck by a car driven by a teenaged girl while out walking. He never recovered from the severe injuries received and spent the rest of his life at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, and died there on December 2, 1957, at the age of 73. He was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Harrison Ford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the Musso & Frank Grill at 6665 Hollywood Blvd. Ford has no known relation to the later film actor of the same name.\n\n Harrison Edward Ford (March 16, 1884 &ndash; December 2, 1957) was an American stage and film actor.

Bonds received the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season.\n\n  In 1998, the teams were connected by the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race, credited by many with revitalizing the sport following the players' strike which cancelled the 1994 World Series and the first part of the 1995 season. In early September the teams met for a two-game series in St. Louis. In the first game, McGwire hit his record-tying 61st home run off pitcher Mike Morgan in the first inning as part of a 3–2 Cardinals victory. The following day, McGwire broke the record with #62 off Steve Trachsel in the fourth inning as part of a 6–3 victory. In a show of sportsmanship, Sammy Sosa embraced and congratulated his rival and on-field opponent after McGwire rounded the bases. McGwire would finish the year with 70 home runs and Sosa with 66. However, the Cubs won the National League wild card, making the playoffs for the first time in nine years, while the Cardinals missed the playoffs. Sosa eventually became the NL MVP that season. Sosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to the memory of Cubs (and former Cardinals) broadcaster Harry Caray, who died in February that year.\n\nQuestion: Who's home runs record did Mark McGwire break in the 1998 season?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and was appointed a CBE shortly thereafter. He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the \"four majors\" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games and European Championships). He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britain's most successful medal winning athlete.\n\n the World Championships, in which he broke the world record twice in the same meeting. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier with a jump of 18.16 m (59 feet 7 inches). That record lasted for about 20 minutes. His second jump of 18.29 m made him the first to jump 60 feet. During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards observed that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if \"he could jump as far as he needed to\". Later that same year, Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. During 1996 Edwards went into the 1996 Summer \n\n Due to his strong Christian beliefs during his athletic career, discussed in more detail below, he initially refused to compete on Sundays, but eventually decided to do so in 1993. This decision proved timely, since the qualifying round at that year's World Championships took place on a Sunday. He went on to win the bronze medal. In his breakthrough year of 1995, Edwards produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5 1⁄2 inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes, but it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year with a historic gold medal performance \n\n Jonathan David Edwards, (born 10 May 1966) is a British former triple jumper. He is an Olympic, World, Commonwealth and European champion, and has held the world record in the event since 1995. Following his retirement as an athlete, Edwards has worked as a sports (primarily athletics) commentator and presenter for BBC television. Formerly a devout Christian, he also presented episodes of the BBC Christian worship programme Songs of Praise, until he renounced his faith in 2007. In 2011 he was elected President of the Wenlock Olympian Society following the death of its then President, Roy Rogers. He was a member of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games for the 2012 games.\n\n These are the results of the Men's triple jump event at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In the first round, Walter Davis took the lead with a 17.20m. Now 35 years old, world record holder and 1995 champion Jonathan Edwards lurked in second place with a 16.84m. Early in the second round Yoel Garcia moved into the lead with a 17.40m. Christian Olsson moved into second with a 17.28m. With his next jump, Olsson took the lead with a 17.47m. The next jumper on the runway was Edwards. His masters world record was more than a foot further than all but one of these jumpers had ever achieved. In the fifth round, Igor Spasovkhodskiy, who was only 7th at the end of the preliminary jumps, leapfrogged past Garcia with a 26cm improvement in his personal best, 17.44m to take the bronze.\n\nQuestion: Where did Jonathan Edwards set his 1995 triple jump world record?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on November 2, 1974.\n\n In his 22-year major league career covering 2,030 games, Cavaretta compiled a .293 batting average (1,977-for-6,754) with 990 runs, 347 doubles, 99 triples, 95 home runs, 920 RBI, 65 stolen bases, 820 bases on balls, .372 on-base percentage and .416 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .989 fielding percentage playing at first base and all three outfield positions. In three World Series (1935, 1938 and 1945) he hit .317 (20-for-63) with 9 runs, 3 doubles, 1 home run, 5 RBI and 4 walks. He later managed in the minor leagues from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1965 to 1972, became a coach and scout with the Tigers, and was a New York Mets organizational hitting instructor. Cavaretta was the last living player to have played against Babe Ruth in a major league game; he did so on May 12, 1935, against the Boston Braves.\n\n Bush did not show much improvement in 1935 with the Pirates. He did, however, place his name into the record books. On May 25, the Pirates played the Braves in one of Babe Ruth's final games. Ruth put on a performance, collecting four hits including three home runs and knocking in six runners. The first home run shot came off pitcher Red Lucas, while the last two came off Bush. The last home run was Ruth's career home run #714, and was a mammoth of a shot. It was the first home run to clear the right field grandstands at Forbes Field and was reportedly measured as a 600 ft bomb. It was the last home run — in fact, the last \n\n record by hitting four consecutive doubles en route to a 15–4 victory.

It is the last multi-homer game of Ruth's career, with the final home run, the 714th of his career, being the first ball ever hit to clear the roof at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. ; May 30 – Babe Ruth ends his playing career with the Boston Braves. \n\n two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed out of the park over the right field upper deck–the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field. Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia—the Braves lost both—was his final major league appearance. Ruth retired on June 2 after an argument with Fuchs.

Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (née Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite. His paternal grandfather, P. J. Kennedy, served as a Massachusetts state legislator. Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as Mayor of Boston. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. Kennedy had an elder brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen (\"Kick\"), Eunice, Patricia, Robert (\"Bobby\"), Jean, and Edward (\"Ted\"). \n\n Kennedy began his political career as the City of Brockton's Ombudsman under Brockton Mayor David Crosby. Kennedy then entered elected office, serving on the Brockton City Council representing Ward 2 from 1978 to 1985. In addition to serving as Brockton City Councilor, from 1978 to 1983 Kennedy also served as an aide to Congressman Brian Donnelly. In 1983 Kennedy won a 9-way special Democratic primary for the 9th Plymouth District with 33% of the vote, after incumbent Democratic State Representative Mark Lawton stepped down. Kennedy served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives as the 9th Plymouth District State Representative from 1983 until 2009. In 2008, incumbent Democratic State Senator Robert S. Creedon decided not to run for re-election, and Kennedy ran for and won the now-vacant State Senate seat, facing no opposition in the Democratic primary. Kennedy served in the Massachusetts State Senate representing the 2nd Plymouth and Bristol district, which includes his hometown of Brockton, Massachusetts and several surrounding towns, until his death in 2015.\n\n Kennedy was born in New York City on January 11, 1965, the ninth child of the eleventh children of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Kennedy was baptized as a Catholic by William Jerome McCormack at St. Patrick's Cathedral in front of a crowd of 200 people. He is named after General Maxwell D. Taylor, then U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam. Kennedy was hospitalized in Bethesda, Maryland, at age 12 after he suffered an injury in an elevator accident at the Rockville home of his uncle and aunt, Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Described as \"wild in his youth,\" Kennedy was expelled from Phillips Academy. He graduated from Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island in 1983, and achieved sobriety in 1985. Kennedy graduated from Harvard College. He then graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law. In 1991, he married Victoria Anne Strauss, the granddaughter of Maurice \"Moe\" Strauss.\n\n  Following his brother's victory in the 1960 Presidential election his Senate seat was left open with Ted reaching the minimum age required to serve in the Senate by the time the special election was to be held. Ted won the special election after facing significant primary and general opposition and would be joined in the Senate by Robert F. Kennedy in 1964. After his eldest brother's assassination, both he and Robert were floated as possible presidential candidates, with Lyndon B. Johnson concerned about the \"Bobby problem\". However, the push for another Kennedy candidate was focused on Robert and only a Draft Bobby campaign was launched in 1964 that gained significant traction in the New Hampshire vice presidential primary, but failed elsewhere. In 1968 Robert ran a presidential campaign, against the advice of Ted who urged him to wait until 1972, that vied with Senator Eugene McCarthy in the \n\n The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Bobby, as well as his 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25000 mi trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends. Bobby would eventually play a major role in his brother's career, serving as his brother's attorney general and presidential advisor. Bobby would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980. Kennedy came in third (behind Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa) in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century. Kennedy was a life member of the National Rifle Association.\n\nQuestion: How old would Bobby Kennedy have been had he lived to the end of the 20th century?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He also appeared in a few films, and is best known for his role in the 1932 movie Freaks. His lifelong career on the outdoor entertainment circuit as a major sideshow attraction with Barnum & Bailey, among others, made him a popular cultural icon.\n\nBiography\nSchlitzie's true birth date, name, location and parents are unknown; the information on his death certificate and gravesite indicate that he was born on September 10, 1901, in The Bronx, New York, though some sources have claimed that he was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Claims that he was born in Yucatán, Mexico, are mistaken reflections of Schlitzie's occasional fanciful billing as \"Maggie, last of the Aztec Children\". Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career.\n\nSchlitzie was born with microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that left him with an unusually small brain and skull, a small stature (), myopia, and severe intellectual disability. It is possible that these features were caused by Seckel syndrome. It was said Schlitzie had the cognition of a three-year-old: he was unable to care fully for himself and could speak only in monosyllabic words and form a few simple phrases. However, he was able to perform simple tasks, and it is believed that he could understand most of what was said to him, as he had a very quick reaction time and the ability to mimic. Those who knew Schlitzie described him as an affectionate, exuberant, sociable person who loved dancing, singing, and being the center of attention, performing for anyone he could stop and talk with.\n\nCareer\nOn the sideshow circuit, microcephalic people were usually promoted as \"pinheads\" or \"missing links\", and Schlitzie was billed under such titles as \"The Last of the Aztecs\", \"The Monkey Girl\", and . In some sideshows, he was paired with another microcephalic performer.\n\nSchlitzie was often dressed in a muumuu and presented as either female or androgynous to add to the mystique of his unusual appearance. Those who knew him alternately used masculine and feminine pronouns. His urinary incontinence, which obliged him to wear diapers, made dresses practical for his care needs, although it is possible that the incontinence did not develop until later in life and was simply a side-effect of age.\n\nThe sideshow circuit was a tremendous success for Schlitzie; throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was employed by many upscale circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, Tom Mix Circus, Crafts 20 Big Shows, and Foley & Burke Carnival. In 1928, Schlitzie made his film debut in The Sideshow, a drama set in a circus, which featured a variety of actual sideshow performers.\n\nFreaks and later work\nSchlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Like The Sideshow, Freaks takes place at a carnival and features a number of genuine sideshow performers, including conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, \"The Living Torso\" Prince Randian, and dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. Two other \"pinheads\" also appear in the film. When referring to Schlitzie, other actors use feminine pronouns.\n\nWhen Freaks premiered in 1932, cinema audiences were scandalized by the appearance of sideshow performers. The United Kingdom banned the film for thirty years. The film was a financial failure, and Browning, although he went on to make several more films for MGM, retired in 1940.\n\nSchlitzie appeared in bit roles in various movies and is credited with a role in the 1934 exploitation film Tomorrow's Children as a mentally defective criminal who undergoes forced sterilization.\n\nWhile Schlitzie was performing with the Tom Mix Circus in 1935, George Surtees, a chimpanzee trainer with a trained-chimpanzee act in the show, adopted him, becoming his legal guardian. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \"Princess Bibi\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie.\n\nHospitalization\nUnder George Surtees' care, Schlitzie continued performing the sideshow circuit; after Surtees' death in 1965, his daughter, who was not in show business, committed Schlitzie to a Los Angeles county hospital.\n\nSchlitzie remained hospitalized for some time until he was recognized by sword swallower Bill \"Frenchy\" Unks, who happened to be working at the hospital during the off-season. According to Unks, Schlitzie seemed to miss the carnival badly, and being away from the public eye had made him very depressed. Hospital authorities determined that the best care for Schlitzie would be to make him a ward of Unks' employer, showman Sam Alexander, and return him to the sideshow, where he remained until 1968.\n\nFinal years\nIn his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. He liked going to MacArthur Park at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, where he would visit the lake with his guardian, feeding the pigeons and ducks and performing for passersby.\n\nDeath\nOn September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \"Shlitze Surtees\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights.\n\nCultural legacy\n\nIn the 1960s, Freaks was rediscovered and enjoyed a long run as one of the first midnight movies, becoming a cult classic, and in 1994 it was selected by the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film became the public's major exposure to Schlitzie, who remains one of the more memorable characters in the film.\n\nSchlitzie's iconic image has lent itself to many products, including masks, hats, shirts, models, clocks, snow globes, and dolls. Additionally, Schlitzie has been cited as an inspiration for Bill Griffith's comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, and the circus freak Bertram in Red Dead Redemption 2. Griffith has recently released Nobody's Fool, a graphic novel biography of Schlitzie.  The Ramones song 'Pinhead' was inspired by him.\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Portrait (2009) of Schlitzie by illustrator Drew Friedman\n The Human Marvels Biography\n\n1901 births\n1971 deaths\nEntertainers with dwarfism\nMale actors from New York City\nSideshow performers\nActors with dwarfism\nDeaths from pneumonia in California\nEntertainers from the Bronx\n20th-century American male actors\nPeople with microcephaly\n\nSchlitzie (alternatively spelled Schlitze or Shlitze; September 10, 1901 – September 24, 1971), possibly born Simon Metz and legally Schlitze Surtees, was an American sideshow performer.

Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career.\n\nSchlitzie was born with microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that left him with an unusually small brain and skull, a small stature (), myopia, and severe intellectual disability. It is possible that these features were caused by Seckel syndrome. It was said Schlitzie had the cognition of a three-year-old: he was unable to care fully for himself and could speak only in monosyllabic words and form a few simple phrases. However, he was able to perform simple tasks, and it is believed that he could understand most of what was said to him, as he had a very quick reaction time and the ability to mimic. Those who knew Schlitzie described him as an affectionate, exuberant, sociable person who loved dancing, singing, and being the center of attention, performing for anyone he could stop and talk with.\n\nCareer\nOn the sideshow circuit, microcephalic people were usually promoted as \"pinheads\" or \"missing links\", and Schlitzie was billed under such titles as \"The Last of the Aztecs\", \"The Monkey Girl\", and . In some sideshows, he was paired with another microcephalic performer.\n\nSchlitzie was often dressed in a muumuu and presented as either female or androgynous to add to the mystique of his unusual appearance. Those who knew him alternately used masculine and feminine pronouns. His urinary incontinence, which obliged him to wear diapers, made dresses practical for his care needs, although it is possible that the incontinence did not develop until later in life and was simply a side-effect of age.\n\nThe sideshow circuit was a tremendous success for Schlitzie; throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was employed by many upscale circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, Tom Mix Circus, Crafts 20 Big Shows, and Foley & Burke Carnival. In 1928, Schlitzie made his film debut in The Sideshow, a drama set in a circus, which featured a variety of actual sideshow performers.\n\nFreaks and later work\nSchlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Like The Sideshow, Freaks takes place at a carnival and features a number of genuine sideshow performers, including conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, \"The Living Torso\" Prince Randian, and dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. Two other \"pinheads\" also appear in the film. When referring to Schlitzie, other actors use feminine pronouns.\n\nWhen Freaks premiered in 1932, cinema audiences were scandalized by the appearance of sideshow performers. The United Kingdom banned the film for thirty years. The film was a financial failure, and Browning, although he went on to make several more films for MGM, retired in 1940.\n\nSchlitzie appeared in bit roles in various movies and is credited with a role in the 1934 exploitation film Tomorrow's Children as a mentally defective criminal who undergoes forced sterilization.\n\nWhile Schlitzie was performing with the Tom Mix Circus in 1935, George Surtees, a chimpanzee trainer with a trained-chimpanzee act in the show, adopted him, becoming his legal guardian. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \"Princess Bibi\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie.\n\nHospitalization\nUnder George Surtees' care, Schlitzie continued performing the sideshow circuit; after Surtees' death in 1965, his daughter, who was not in show business, committed Schlitzie to a Los Angeles county hospital.\n\nSchlitzie remained hospitalized for some time until he was recognized by sword swallower Bill \"Frenchy\" Unks, who happened to be working at the hospital during the off-season. According to Unks, Schlitzie seemed to miss the carnival badly, and being away from the public eye had made him very depressed. Hospital authorities determined that the best care for Schlitzie would be to make him a ward of Unks' employer, showman Sam Alexander, and return him to the sideshow, where he remained until 1968.\n\nFinal years\nIn his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. He liked going to MacArthur Park at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, where he would visit the lake with his guardian, feeding the pigeons and ducks and performing for passersby.\n\nDeath\nOn September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \"Shlitze Surtees\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights.\n\nCultural legacy\n\nIn the 1960s, Freaks was rediscovered and enjoyed a long run as one of the first midnight movies, becoming a cult classic, and in 1994 it was selected by the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film became the public's major exposure to Schlitzie, who remains one of the more memorable characters in the film.\n\nSchlitzie's iconic image has lent itself to many products, including masks, hats, shirts, models, clocks, snow globes, and dolls. Additionally, Schlitzie has been cited as an inspiration for Bill Griffith's comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, and the circus freak Bertram in Red Dead Redemption 2. Griffith has recently released Nobody's Fool, a graphic novel biography of Schlitzie.  The Ramones song 'Pinhead' was inspired by him.\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Portrait (2009) of Schlitzie by illustrator Drew Friedman\n The Human Marvels Biography\n\n1901 births\n1971 deaths\nEntertainers with dwarfism\nMale actors from New York City\nSideshow performers\nActors with dwarfism\nDeaths from pneumonia in California\nEntertainers from the Bronx\n20th-century American male actors\nPeople with microcephaly\n\n Frank Oakley, also known as Slivers (1871–1916) was the most popular circus clown of his generation.

Ekins is best known as the actor who jumped the fence on a motorcycle in the 1963 film The Great Escape, and one of the stuntmen who drove the Ford Mustang 390 GT in the car chase scene in the 1968 film Bullitt. The chase scene led by stunt coordinator Carey Loftin and filmed on the streets of San Francisco, is regarded as one of the most influential in film history. He also coordinated the stunts for the popular 1970s motorcycle cop show CHiPs. Ekins eventually became one of the best stuntmen in Hollywood. He continued doing stunt work until he was in his mid-60s, his stunt career spanned 30 years.

CBS reran these thirteen specials under the \"Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour\" title as prime-time summer replacements, from 1962 to 1965, with a final run in 1967. 1966–67 was the first TV season in which all first-run prime time network shows were in color.

Elvia Allman portrayed Mother Frump, whom Margaret Hamilton had played in the original series. Veteran character actors Parley Baer and Vito Scotti, who both had recurring roles in the original series, also appeared in the movie. The film also included extended family members created specifically for this production, such as Gomez's brother Pancho (played by Henry Darrow) and two additional children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr. The latter two were portrayed as near copies of the original children, now known as Wednesday Sr. and Pugsley Sr., who were once again played respectively by Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax, the original Wednesday and Pugsley in the \n\n The Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\" (a.k.a. \"Wednesday is Missing\"), which first aired on CBS Saturday morning on September 23, 1972. John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy provided the voices for their respective Addams Family characters while voice actors were used to voice Grandmama, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Cousin Itt. The episode details the Addams Family in a mystery with the Scooby-Doo gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams comics.\n\n Vic Mizzy rewrote and conducted the series theme as an instrumental. In 1972, the third episode of the Saturday morning animated series The New Scooby-Doo Movies featured the Addams Family. Astin, Jones, Coogan, and Cassidy all reprised their roles; 11-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. This episode was the pilot for the 1973 animated series. Coogan and Cassidy were the only original series cast members who returned for this series. Jodie Foster also returned as the voice of Pugsley. Astin reprised his role as Gomez Addams for the 1992 animated adaptation of the series. Weatherwax and Loring, the only other original cast members still living at the time, did not participate. In 1998, a standalone film, Addams Family Reunion, aired on the Fox Family Channel, followed by the series The New Addams Family that ran from 1998 to 2000. Astin appeared in the series as Grandpapa Addams.\n\n The Addams Family is an American animated sitcom adaptation of the Charles Addams single-panel comic for The New Yorker. The series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions for Saturday mornings in 1973 and was rebroadcast the following season. Jackie Coogan and Ted Cassidy, who played Uncle Fester and Lurch respectively from the 1960s television series, returned in voice-over roles. The cast also included an 11-year-old Jodie Foster, who performed the voice of Pugsley Addams. The show's theme music was completely different and had no lyrics and no finger snapping, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.\n\n The first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1975 on NBC. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a Victorian-style RV. This series also marked the point where the relationships between the characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez's brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia's mother (though the old relationships between the characters would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, in order to retain its continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not; their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents Lennie Weinrib as Gomez and Janet Waldo as Morticia, while a ten-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. A complementary comic book series was produced in connection with the show, but it only lasted three issues.

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless.\n\nIn 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. The 8-episode miniseries is based on Michelle Dean's 2016 BuzzFeed article. Dean is an executive producer and writer for the first season of the series. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role.  Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. The Act premiered on March 20, 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nSee also\n\n Julie Gregory, an Ohio woman who wrote a memoir in 2003, Sickened'', about her mother's Munchausen by proxy abuse of her, which she tried to report to various health professionals\n Wendi Michelle Scott, a Maryland woman with Munchausen by proxy who injected her four-year-old daughter with magnesium in 2007 and was sentenced to prison in 2008\n Murder of Garnett Spears, a boy in Valhalla, New York, whose mother also had Munchausen by proxy, leading her to fatally poison him with table salt in 2014\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2015 murders in the United States\nDeaths by person in the United States\nDeaths by stabbing in Missouri\nMatricides\nMurder in Missouri\nHistory of Springfield, Missouri\nChild abuse incidents and cases\nViolence against women in the United States\nIncidents of violence against women\nJune 2015 crimes in the United States\nJune 2015 events in the United States\n2015 in Missouri\n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless.\n\nIn 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. The 8-episode miniseries is based on Michelle Dean's 2016 BuzzFeed article. Dean is an executive producer and writer for the first season of the series. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role.  Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. The Act premiered on March 20, 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nSee also\n\n Julie Gregory, an Ohio woman who wrote a memoir in 2003, Sickened'', about her mother's Munchausen by proxy abuse of her, which she tried to report to various health professionals\n Wendi Michelle Scott, a Maryland woman with Munchausen by proxy who injected her four-year-old daughter with magnesium in 2007 and was sentenced to prison in 2008\n Murder of Garnett Spears, a boy in Valhalla, New York, whose mother also had Munchausen by proxy, leading her to fatally poison him with table salt in 2014\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2015 murders in the United States\nDeaths by person in the United States\nDeaths by stabbing in Missouri\nMatricides\nMurder in Missouri\nHistory of Springfield, Missouri\nChild abuse incidents and cases\nViolence against women in the United States\nIncidents of violence against women\nJune 2015 crimes in the United States\nJune 2015 events in the United States\n2015 in Missouri\n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth.\n\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.\n\nFurther investigations found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDee Dee's background\n\nEarly life and marriage of Dee Dee Blanchard\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.\n\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\". At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.\n\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.\n\nChildhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.\n\nGypsy stated that, when she was 7 or 8, she was riding on her grandfather's motorcycle when they were involved in a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee. Her mother stated that doctors had given her a wheelchair which she would need to use.\n\nGypsy often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8 (she was actually 10), she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\n\nGypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe; this was later believed to have been an attempt to isolate Gypsy to further her abuse. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books.\n\nWhile Gypsy's father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. Her stepmother's health returned to normal shortly afterward.\n\nIn Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.\n\nMove to Missouri\nAt first, Clauddine and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in the southwestern area of the state. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. In 2008, Habitat for Humanity built them a small home with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub as part of a larger project on the north side of Springfield, to the east, and they moved there. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee.\n\nThe outpouring of support included many charitable contributions. In Louisiana, mother and daughter had at most availed themselves of occasional stays in Ronald McDonald Houses during medical appointments; in Missouri, they received free flights to see doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, free trips to Walt Disney World, and backstage passes to Miranda Lambert concerts (where she was frequently photographed with the singer) via the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Rod Blanchard also continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,200, as well as sending Gypsy gifts and occasionally talking to her on the phone (during one call, on her 18th birthday, he recalls Dee Dee telling him not to mention her daughter's real age since \"she thinks she's 14\").\n\nRod and his second wife regularly hoped to get to Springfield and visit, but for a variety of reasons, Dee Dee would change plans. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money.\n\nMany people who met Gypsy were charmed by her. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. She often wore wigs or hats to cover her baldness; her mother regularly shaved Gypsy's head to mimic the hairless appearance of a chemotherapy patient, allegedly telling Gypsy that since her medication would eventually cause her hair to fall out, it was best to shave it in advance. When they left the house, Dee Dee often took an oxygen tank and feeding tube with them; Gypsy was fed the children's liquid nutrition supplement PediaSure well into her 20s.\n\nDee Dee used physical abuse to control her daughter, always holding her daughter's hand in the presence of others. Whenever Gypsy said something that either suggested she was not genuinely sick or seemed above her purported mental capabilities, Gypsy recalls that her mother would give her a very tight squeeze. When the two were alone, Dee Dee would strike her with her open hands or a coat hanger.\n\nMedical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections.\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk\", he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nFlasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. The file was closed.\n\nGrowing independence of Gypsy\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of her daughter's birth certificate, moving her birth date to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager; Gypsy said in a later interview that for 15 years she was not sure of her real age. She sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding. Dee Dee did keep another copy with Gypsy's actual birth date. Her daughter recalls seeing it during one of their hospital visits and becoming confused; Dee Dee told her it was a misprint.\n\nSince 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. At an event in 2011, she made what may have been an escape attempt that ended when her mother found her in a hotel room with a man she had met online. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Gypsy recalls that afterward, Dee Dee smashed her computer with a hammer and threatened to do the same to her fingers if she ever tried to escape again; she also kept Gypsy leashed and handcuffed to her bed for two weeks. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her.\n\nSometime around 2012, Gypsy, who continued to use the Internet after her mother had gone to bed to avoid her tightened supervision, made contact online with Nicholas Godejohn, a man around her age from Big Bend, Wisconsin (she said they met on a Christian singles group). Godejohn a criminal record for indecent exposure and a history of mental illness, sometimes reported as dissociative identity disorder. He also had Asperger syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, Gypsy confided to Aleah Woodmansee, a 23-year-old neighbor who, unaware that Gypsy was close to her own age, considered herself a \"big sister\", that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping and had even chosen names for potential children. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. She considered Gypsy's plans just \"fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.\" Despite Dee Dee's efforts to prevent her from using the Internet, which went as far as destroying her daughter's phone and laptop,  Gypsy maintained contact with Godejohn, who saved printouts of her posts, until 2014.\n\nThe next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee.\n\nMurder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee.\n\nGypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime.\n\nThey mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted.\n\nInvestigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. When phone calls went unanswered, several of them went to the house.\n\nWhile they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. Protective film on the windows made it hard to see inside in the low light. No one answered the door, so they called 9-1-1. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present.\n\nWhen the warrant was issued, police entered the house and soon found Dee Dee's body. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay for her funeral expenses, and possibly Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.\n\nWoodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. She showed them the printouts she had saved, which included his name. Based on that information, police asked Facebook to trace the IP address from which the posts to Dee Dee's account had been made. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action.\n\nThe news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. But, in announcing the news, Greene County sheriff Jim Arnott warned \"things are not always what they appear.\" The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud.\n\nTrials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. So undernourished was Gypsy that during the year she was in the county jail, he told BuzzFeed later, she gained , in contrast to most of his clients who lose weight in that situation.  In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGodejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. Her plea bargain agreement did not require her to testify against him. In January 2017, his trial was postponed when prosecutors requested a second psychiatric exam; his lawyers contend that he has an intelligence quotient of 82 and is on the autism spectrum, suggesting that he has diminished capacity. He had initially waived his right to a trial by jury, but changed his mind in June of that year.\n\nIn December 2017, the judge set Godejohn's trial for November 2018. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. In some of the texts, he asked her for details about Dee Dee's room and sleeping habits. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her.\n\nGypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan.\n\nAfter four days, the case was sent to the jury. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.\n\nIn February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. He received a sentence of 25 years on that charge, which is concurrent with the life sentence.\n\nJones also denied a motion by Godejohn's lawyer, Dewayne Perry, for a new trial. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. The judge, in denying the motion, conceded that an appeals court could find the latter point significant and consider it a reversible error.\n\nAftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid?\" Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\"  Only one of the charities that had helped the Blanchards spoke after the revelations.  A spokesman for Habitat for Humanity, whose volunteers had built the Blanchards' house along with others on their street, said, \"We are just really, deeply saddened by the whole situation.\"\n\nFamily\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet.\n\nRod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. \"[I]t was like a tornado got started.\" He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power.\n\nGypsy Rose\n{{cquote|I feel like I'm more free in prison, than with living with my mom. Because now, I'm allowed to just live like a normal woman|author=Gypsy Rose Blanchard|source=20/20, January 4, 2018|width=60%}}\nGypsy, now serving her sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center, did not talk to the media until after she had made her plea. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did.\n\nWhen Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims.\n\nVictims of Munchausen by proxy abuse often avoid doctors and hospitals in their later lives because of lingering trust issues, according to expert Marc Feldman. According to her family, Dean, and Carr, Gypsy also exhibits at times the same sociopathic manipulative behaviors as her mother, who was for much of her life her only role model. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. \"I hope they find someone wherever she chooses to settle who is willing to provide supportive psychotherapy.\"\n\nMedical community\nFlasterstein, the pediatric neurologist who believed Gypsy was fully capable of walking on her own and wrote in his notes that he suspected Munchausen by proxy, says it was only the second such possible case he had ever come across. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. \"Poor Gypsy\", he said. \"She suffered all those years, and for no reason.\" He told Dean he wished he could have done more.\n\nFeldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. \"[H]e had a gross misunderstanding of his obligations as a physician, as well as the legal requirements to report suspected abuse or neglect\", Feldman said. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\"\n\nWhile a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. \"Gypsy was infantilized and kept away from her peers\", he said. \"She was little more than a tool for Dee Dee to navigate through the world the way she wanted to.\" He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017.\n\nTelevision\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer.\n\nThe ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn.\n\nThe Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively.\n\nThe Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018.\n\nInvestigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge.

Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs.

Visits occurring during the 1940s through 1980s were offshoots of American diplomatic interactions following World War II and during the Cold War. To date, 40 visits have been made to France, 32 to Germany (including 10 specifically to West Germany or West Berlin), 20 to Belgium, 11 to Switzerland, six to Austria, and five to the Netherlands. No president has yet visited Liechtenstein, Luxembourg or Monaco.\n\n  The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Barack Obama for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a \"new climate\" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. The Nobel Committee's decision drew mixed reactions from US commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum, as well as from the rest of the world. Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \"just war\" saying, \"perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\" Obama is the fourth President of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, with Carter's honor happening after leaving office).\n\n awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, after Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and Woodrow Wilson (1919)—both of whom received the award during their terms—and Jimmy Carter (2002), who received the award 21 years after leaving office. In addition, then-sitting Vice President Charles Dawes was a co-winner with Austen Chamberlain (1925), and former Vice President Al Gore was a co-winner with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) Obama was the first U.S. president to receive the award during his first year in office (at eight and a half months, after being nominated less than two weeks in office), although several other world leaders were awarded in the year following their election to national office, including Óscar Arias (1987) and Aung San Suu Kyi (1991).\n\n The Paris Peace Conference, that sought a lasting peace after World War I, approved the proposal to create the League of Nations (French: Société des Nations, German: Völkerbund) on 25 January 1919. The Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles. On 28 June 1919, the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President Woodrow Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919, the United States did not join the League. The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force. In November, the headquarters of the League moved to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920 with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.\n\n provided the photograph which designer Clair Aubrey Houston used for the image. The 17-cent paid the combined first-class postage and registration fee. Woodrow Wilson appears on the 1-dollar 1938 Presidential Series stamp. The twenty-eighth president of the United States, Wilson led the United States through World War I with a reputation as a peacemaker. In 1920, he became the first American president to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The post office used two-color stamps for the high value rates so that they would not be confused with the cent denominations. The 1-dollar was used for parcels, registered letters and heavier international airmails.\n\nQuestion: Which US president won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1920?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The existing world record for two handed javelin throw by Eric Lemming was 91.28 metres, but with their enhancement, Jarl broke it with 91.41 metres. It was then improved by Evert to 98.47, followed by Lemming imitating their grip and taking back the record with 104.40 metres. At this point, the new grip was banned and all results achieved with it were disqualified, reverting the world record to 91.28. He entered four events in the Olympic Games:\n\n All the cross-country events were held next to the ski jump hill at Holmenkollbakken. As had been the case in 1948 there were three men's events: 18 kilometers, 50 kilometers, and a relay. Added to the Olympic program for the first time was a ten-kilometer race for women. All the cross-country medals were won by Nordic countries, and Finnish skiers won eight of the twelve possible. Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross-country skiing; her teammates Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen won silver and bronze respectively. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men's race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold. Hallgeir Brenden won the 18-kilometer race and helped Norway take the silver in the 4 × 10-kilometer relay. Brenden went on to win another gold in the men's 15-kilometer race in 1956, and a silver in the relay in 1960.\n\n behind Swedes Margareta Simu and Elisabeth Olsson –this made her only the second Norwegian to medal after 1971 winner Thorhild Sarpebakken. She also took a silver medal indoors in the 3000 m walk at the 1978 Nordic Indoor Race Walking Championships, with Simu again topping the podium. Gylder was the dominant female walker nationally during her career, taking six consecutive 5000 metres race walk titles from 1975 to 1980 and seven straight titles in the 10 kilometres race walk discipline. Her victories followed on from those of her sister, Gerd Gylder, who was also an international walker for Norway.\n\n She won her first Olympic medals in 1998, and won her first gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics, coming from behind to beat the favourites Olga Danilova and Julija Tchepalova in the last kilometers of the 10 km classical event. She also won a bronze medal in 30 km classical as well as a silver medal in the relay. Additionally, she won five gold medals (5 km: 1999, 10 km: 2001, 2003, and 15 km: 2001, 2003) from the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, as well as two silver (4 × 5 km relay: 1997, 2001) medals. She won the overall cross-country skiing World Cup four times before retiring after the 2003 season. Skari also won the women's 30 km event at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 2003. In 2001, she received the Holmenkollen medal (shared with Adam Małysz and Thomas Alsgaard). Her father, Odd Martinsen, earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1969. They are the only father-daughter combination to ever win this prestigious honour. In 1998, she won Tjejvasan.\n\nQuestion: In which events did Gert Fredriksson win six Olympic gold medals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was race 1 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the sixth Argentine Grand Prix. It was held on the #2 variation of the circuit. The race was held over 80 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 313 kilometres. The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss in Rob Walker's privately entered Cooper T43. Apart from being the first World Drivers Championship race win for Cooper as a constructor it was also the first win for a rear-engined car, the first win for a car entered by a privateer team and the first win for a car powered by an engine built by another manufacturer. Moss took his seventh Grand Prix victory by 2.7 seconds over Italian driver Luigi Musso (Ferrari 246 F1). Musso's British teammate Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari 246 F1) was third.\n\n The 1953 German Grand Prix was a Formula Two motor racing event held on 2 August 1953 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. It was race 7 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula Two rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. This race had the highest number of cars on the grid of any World Drivers' Championship race, with 34 starters. This race was won by Nino Farina in a Ferrari, just over 1 minute ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio. This was Farina's last victory in Formula One. Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari clinched his second consecutive World Drivers' Championship as neither Mike Hawthorn nor Juan Manuel Fangio won the race and now couldn't beat his points total with two races left. During his tour of Europe that saw Japan's 19-year old Crown Prince Akihito visit the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, he also attended the German Grand Prix.\n\n given them fifth place in the previous year's race. For the fourth consecutive race, Hawthorn was the quickest driver over a single lap, but his best lap of 4’ 08 was well down on his 3’ 58.7 record of 1957. Sadly, this was the last Le Mans for the Ferrari works drivers: both Musso and Collins were killed in Grand Prix later in the year and, after retiring as the 1958 F1 World Champion, Hawthorn would also be killed within the next year. In a grim year it also saw the death of Peter Whitehead, killed in an accident when his half-brother was driving in the Tour de France Automobile.\n\n Initially Mike Hawthorn was assigned to drive the Ferrari 412 MI #12 for the 1958 edition of the Race of Two Worlds. But when he felt unwell, his teammate Luigi Musso had to run the race. Hawthorn and Phil Hill drove the car later, as relief drivers. Qualifying began late on Friday when the track had dried up. Luigi Musso recorded the fastest time of all the European entries, with a 55.3 second lap in the 412 MI. He was only 0.1 seconds slower than Fangio in the Kuzma-Offy racer. But since the qualifying was determined by an average speed of three \n\n The 1958 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 6 July 1958. It was race 6 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 5 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Mike Hawthorn driving a Ferrari 246 F1; it was his first Formula One victory since the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix and would prove to be his last. It was also the last Formula One race for five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio. On the final lap, Hawthorn eased up to let Fangio, running fifth at the time, finish on the lead lap of his last race. This turned out to be a blessing, as Peter Collins crashed \n\nQuestion: How many of his 45 races did Mike Hawthorn, a former Formula One motor racing world champion, win?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In contrast, spam email messages are generally accepted to be unsolicited. ; Legitimate. Though they may be sale notices, coupons, social updates and the like, graymail messages are sent by reputable sources who value their relationship with the recipient. They will typically contain an unsubscribe option, with the sender honoring such requests. ; Content value. Graymail messages generally contain content that is targeted to the recipient or their interests as opposed to spam email messages which are indiscriminate bulk distribution of unwanted solicitations, offers and information. Graymail differs from spam and can be identified by one or more of the following traits:  In addition there is often a timeliness component to graymail whereby the utility of the message expires or becomes out of date after a period of time. Shopping deals are a good example: they’re only valid for a fixed number of hours or days but are frequently not read or opened by the recipient until after the offer has expired.\n\n The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response to the growing number of complaints over spam emails. Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial emails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US$16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient. However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are \"materially false or misleading\". In addition there \n\n The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as \"ACMA\". The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages, states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with three fines of AU$110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines (2011), Tiger Airways Holdings Limited (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013).\n\n  Mobile phone spam is a form of spam (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. As the popularity of mobile phones surged in the early 2000s, frequent users of text messaging began to see an increase in the number of unsolicited (and generally unwanted) commercial advertisements being sent to their telephones through text messaging. This can be particularly annoying for the recipient because, unlike in email, some recipients may be charged a fee for every message received, including spam. Mobile phone spam is generally less pervasive than email spam, where in 2010 around 90% of email is spam. The amount of mobile spam varies widely from region to region. In North America, mobile spam steadily increased after \n\n Wallace's terminology that prevailed. ; spam – unwanted repetitious messages, such as unsolicited bulk e-mail. ; The term spam is derived from the Monty Python SPAM sketch, set in a cafe where everything on the menu includes SPAM luncheon meat.

It was presented to the CCIT in 1976 by Derek Barber, who became INWG chair earlier that year. Although the protocol was adopted by networks in Europe, it was not adopted by the CCIT or by the ARPANET. CCIT went on to adopt the X.25 standard in 1976, based on virtual circuits, and ARPA ultimately developed the Internet protocol suite, based on the Internet Protocol as connectionless layer and the Transmission Control Protocol as a reliable connection-oriented service. Later international work led to the OSI model in 1984, \n\nApril 7 –, the first Request for Comments document from the Internet Engineering Task Force, is published. ; October 29 – The first ARPANET message is sent, between computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Stanford Research Institute. ; November 21 – The first permanent ARPANET link is established, between Interface Message Processors at UCLA and Stanford. ; The laser printer is invented at Xerox by Gary Starkweather. ; CCD invented at AT&T Bell Labs, used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras. \n\n In August 1968, BBN was selected by ARPA to build an Interface Message Processor (IMP) for the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern Internet. The IMPs were the very first generation of gateways, known today as routers. Under the leadership of Frank Heart and Bob Kahn, four IMPs were produced for nearly US$1 million from September to December 1969. The first IMP was shipped to the University of California, Los Angeles in September 1969 and the second to the Stanford Research Institute a month later. The first message between the two IMPs was \"LO\" — phonetically, \"Hello\" — but the SRI host crashed before the UCLA researcher could complete typing the \"LOGIN\" command.\n\n where required. AARNet was initially built as a multi-protocol network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet systems then in current use. With the rapid subsequent growth in popularity of the Internet, AARNet soon evolved into an IP-only network. In 1988, there were a number of popular network protocols, such as IBM's SNA and the CCITT's X.25, and the ARPANET's IP protocol was only beginning to become favoured. Australian National University staff members Geoff Huston and Peter Elford were seconded by the AVCC in 1989 and tasked with technical management and build of the new network. AARNet introduced its 'value added reseller' program to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to use its network, the first being Connect.com.au in \n\n  Beginning in the early 1980s, ARPA pursued commercial partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry which enabled the adoption of TCP/IP. In Europe, CERN purchased UNIX machines with TCP/IP for their intranet between 1984 and 1988. Nonetheless, Paul Bryant, the UK representative on the EARN Board of Directors, said \"By the time JNT [the UK academic network JANET] came along [in 1984] we could demonstrate X25 ... and we firmly believed that BT [British Telecom] would provide us with the network infrastructure and we could do away with leased lines and experimental work.

His principal rival appeared to be Cacoethes, who had finished third to Nashwan in the Derby before winning the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. The best of the older horses, according to the betting, was Sheriff's Star, the winner of the Coronation Cup and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. The only overseas challenger was the Italian colt Tisserand, the winner of the 1988 Derby Italiano.

The first caution was for a dog on the track on lap 48. Bill Elliott defeated Terry Labonte by six car lengths in front of 63,000 spectators. Three hundred and twelve laps were run on the paved oval spanning 1 mi in two hours and fifty-seven minutes.

Later in the same year, he won the Breeders' Cup Classic and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and American Horse of the Year. Sunday Silence's racing career was marked by his rivalry with Easy Goer, whom he had a three to one edge over in their head-to-head races.

Written by guitarist Chris Stein, the song was inspired by Debbie Harry's cat, who was named Sunday Man—the cat had recently run away, inspiring the song's \"plaintive\" nature. \"Sunday Girl\" was released as the follow-up single to the band's number one hit single, \"Heart of Glass,\" in the UK and Europe (though not in the US). The single was a number 1 hit in the UK and Ireland and reached the top ten in several European countries. It has since seen critical acclaim and has been included on several compilation albums.\n\n as the lead single from Parallel Lines, but failed to chart; however, it was later re-released as a double A-side with \"Heart of Glass\", on the back of its UK success, resulting in the song reaching number five in the country. In 2013, Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.\n\n Although disco music had been declared \"dead\" in the US in a backlash in 1979, several songs which continued and advanced the exuberant surge of up-tempo dance music managed to scale the US pop charts in the intervening years, notably Blondie's \"Call Me\" in 1980, and Irene Cara's \"Flashdance (What A Feeling)\" in 1983. begun in England in the early 1980s. By 1984 Ian Levine had re-established himself as a producer and asked Evelyn Thomas to come to London to record a new track \"High Energy\".

Sleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song \"Atomic\", which was used in the film Trainspotting, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. \"Statuesque\" also features in the movie and its follow-up soundtrack volume. The band’s third album, Pleased to Meet You, released October 1997, was a UK Top 10 hit and certified silver, though had fewer sales than the previous albums; the band split in March 1998 after a tour in which venues had been cancelled or downsized due to lower than expected ticket sales.\n\n Reviving an old number one for the second time to create another one for themselves were girl group Atomic Kitten.

Some areas (including the state of Baja California) change on the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in November, matching the schedule in most of the U.S.A.. Some others, including Quintana Roo and Sonora, do not observe DST.\n\nWhen it comes to traveling east, one of the main factors that contribute to the difficulty is the advancement of the sleep-wake cycle. This means that when you travel east, you are essentially resetting your body's internal clock to match the new time zone, and this process can be more challenging than delaying the cycle when traveling west.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of jet lag when traveling east, there are several strategies that individuals can employ. One effective approach is to gradually adjust your sleep schedule before the trip. This means gradually going to bed and waking up earlier in the days leading up to your departure. By doing so, you can help your body adapt to the new time zone more smoothly.\n\nIt's also important to stay hydrated during the flight and throughout your trip. Dehydration can exacerbate the symptoms of jet lag, so make sure to drink plenty of water and avoid excessive alcohol or caffeine intake, as they can further dehydrate the body.\n\nExposing yourself to natural light can also help regulate your body's internal clock. Try spending time outside during daylight hours in your destination, particularly in the morning. This exposure to natural light can help signal to your body that it's time to be awake and active.\n\nIt's also advisable to adjust your activities and routines to match the local time as soon as you arrive at your destination. This includes not only sleeping and waking up at the appropriate times but also eating meals and engaging in activities based on the local time zone. This helps your body adapt more quickly to the new schedule.\n\nLastly, consider speaking to your healthcare provider about the possibility of using medications or supplements to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag. There are certain medications, such as melatonin, that can help regulate your sleep-wake cycle and aid in adjusting to the new time zone. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medications, as they may have potential side effects or interactions with other medications.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, individuals can mitigate the effects of jet lag and adjust more easily to the new time zone when traveling east.\n\n Although Hawaii is further away from equator than Fiji, and therefore there is a slightly greater variation in the daylight length, Hawaii does not observe DST. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, and Oahu, Kauai and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. Therefore advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June. Hawaii did experiment with DST for three weeks between April 30, 1933 and May 21, 1933; there are no known official records as to why it was implemented or discontinued. Hawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the Uniform Time Act, having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967.\n\n The territory of Nunavut comprises three time zones: Mountain Time in the west, Central Time in the centre and Eastern Time in the east. Daylight saving time is observed throughout Nunavut with the exception of Southampton Island, including Coral Harbour, and Eureka—a permanent research station on Ellesmere Island—both of which remain on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. On February 19, 2007, Nunavut added parts of March and November to its daylight saving period, following the United States' Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n\n Mountain Time zones of Oregon and Idaho close their polls. ; Nevada, Utah, Montana, Iowa close their polls. ; 11 p.m ; The Pacific Time zones of Oregon and Idaho close their polls. ; California, Hawaii, and Washington close their polls. ; November 9 ; 12 a.m ; Alaska closes its polls. ; 2:45 a.m. Eastern time ; Donald Trump is the projected winner of the election, becoming president-elect. ; Morningtime ; The 2016 Portland, Oregon riots begin ; The 2016 Oakland riots begin ; Protests begin in numerous other cities ; November 23 – Jill Stein starts fundraising for a recount effort in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. \n\nQuestion: If it is 3 a.m. in Nevada, what time is it in Montana?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The 82nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Kansas City Royals and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Royals upset the heavily favored Cardinals in seven games. The Series was popularly known as the \"Show-Me Series\" or the \"I-70 Showdown Series,\" as both cities are in the state of Missouri which is nicknamed the \"Show Me State\" and are connected by Interstate 70. The Cardinals won the NL East division by three games over the New York Mets, then defeated the \n\n Major Leagsecond-longest such streak since the MLB postseason was expanded in 1995. The 4th-seeded Royals entered the 2014 World Series after defeating the 5th-seeded Oakland Athletics 9&ndash;8 in the AL Wild Card game, sweeping the top-seeded Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in three games in the ALDS, and sweeping the 2nd-seeded Baltimore Orioles in four games in the ALCS. They were the first team to enter a World Series with an 8–0 record in that year's postseason and only the second to enter the World Series undefeated in the postseason since the creation of the Wild Card in 1994.\n\n After Charlie Finley moved the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland, California, Missouri Senator Stuart Symington threatened to remove professional baseball's antitrust exemption. Major League Baseball responded by awarding an expansion team to Kansas City which started play in 1969 under Ewing Kauffman. The Royals had winning seasons by 1971 and moved into their new home in the Truman Sports Complex at Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium) in 1973, beginning a decade in which they appeared in the World Series two times (winning once) and won six American League West division titles. In 1972, the Kansas City Chiefs played their first game at the new Arrowhead Stadium. Ironically the Chiefs football franchise, who had defined Kansas City in the 1960s and those heady days at Municipal Stadium, went into a decline, having only two winning seasons between 1974 and 1988 and participating in only one playoff game from 1972 through \n\n The Kansas City Royals are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Kansas City, Missouri.

Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of 30368609 km2, excluding adjacent islands. Its highest mountain is Mount Kilimanjaro, its largest lake is Lake Victoria. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km wide. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa.

Further, Egypt denied passage through the Suez Canal to Israeli-registered ships or to any ship carrying cargo to or from Israeli ports. This made Eilat and its sea port crucial to Israel's communications, commerce and trade with Africa and Asia, and for oil imports. Without recourse to a port on the Red Sea Israel would have been unable to develop its diplomatic, cultural and trade ties \n\n El Salam Canal (ترعة السلام) is a canal built as a part of the Sinai Project. It starts at the Damietta branch of the Nile and stretches southwest towards Lake Manzala, then south to drain at El Sarow drainage. It then moves east and then again south to Hadoos drainage. It then moves east under the Suez Canal in four tunnels. It continues on the other side of the Suez Canal as the El-Sheikh Jaber canal.\n\n  The Suez Canal, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the sea journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. Built by French interests, 56% of the stocks in the canal remained in their hands, while 44% of the stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt. He was notorious for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and \n\n The Suez Canal was completed in 1869, linking the Levantine Sea to the Red Sea &ndash; and mainly for large vessels. The Red Sea sits a little higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal is an intermittent tidal strait discharging water into the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes &ndash; hypersaline natural lakes, interacting with the canal &ndash; were a bar to migration of Red Sea species northward for many decades, but as their salinity has virtually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize \n\nQuestion: The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea to which other Sea?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By the time of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, there were many calls, such as the May Fourth Movement, to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate democracy, republicanism, and industrialism into Chinese philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-sen at the beginning of the 20th century In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President. But power in Beijing already had passed to Yuan Shikai, who had effective control of the Beiyang Army, the most powerful military force in China at the time.

While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming, refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan Shikai. In order to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party, members must take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period. Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a rival government in Guangzhou, but was soon \n\n The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 forced the abdication of the last Qing Emperor Puyi and ended China's last imperial dynasty. The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors. Such an endorsement from the \"Father of Modern China\" started to transform the Great Wall into a national \n\n 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China and co-founder of the KMT, was supportive of Sino-Soviet co-operation, which had involved forming the First United Front with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature.

Born in 1929 in Cairo, Egypt, Arafat soon became a supporter of Arab nationalism and anti-Zionism; in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood against the newly independent State of Israel. From 1969 until 2004, he served as the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a Palestinian nationalist organization which engaged in a numerous guerilla conflicts with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the second half of the 20th century. Beginning from 1983 onwards, Arafat based himself in Tunisia \n\n Al Hassan was born in Haifa Palestine, in 1939. He is one of the founding members of Fatah, the biggest faction of the PLO, and the first Palestinian ambassador to Iran, following the revolution. During the 1970s he led the indirect negotiations between the PLO and the United States. Although opposed to the Oslo agreement, al Hassan was appointed by Arafat as the Minister of Interior. Following the collapse of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Camp David in 2000, Hani Al Hassan remained with Arafat and following the death of Arafat, Al Hassan accused Israel of killing Yasser Arafat.

While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir John Spencer (died 1600).\n\n By his wife, Alice Bromfield, Spencer had an only child, Elizabeth, who in 1598 was sought in marriage by William Compton, 2nd Lord Compton. Spencer strongly disapproved of the match, but Compton's influence at court enabled him to procure Spencer's imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in March 1599 for ill-treating his daughter. The young lady was ultimately carried off by her lover from Canonbury Tower in a baker's basket. The marriage quickly followed, but Spencer gave his daughter no marriage portion. When, in May 1601, his daughter became a mother, he showed no signs of relenting. But some reconciliation apparently took place soon afterwards, it is said, through the intervention of Elizabeth.\n\n Largely denied access to personal relationships with men of their own rank, several of the daughters of George III embarked on such romances with gentlemen at court. Augusta Sophia first met Sir Brent Spencer, a senior Anglo-Irish officer in the British Army, around 1800. As she wrote to her brother, the future King George IV, then Prince Regent, in 1812, the two had entered into an understanding around 1803, while Spencer was stationed in England. In 1805 he was appointed as an equerry to the king. The couple conducted their romance with the utmost privacy, and Augusta asked the Prince Regent in 1812 to consent to her marrying Spencer, promising further discretion in their behaviour. While no record of a marriage between the two exists, it was noted at the court of Hesse-Homburg at the time of her sister Elizabeth's marriage in 1818 that Augusta was \"privately married.\" It was Spencer who informed Augusta of her mother's death later that year, and Spencer was said to be holding a locket with Augusta's picture when he died in 1828.\n\n Georgiana Spencer (1757–1806), daughter of the 1st Earl Spencer, married William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire ; Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Sunderland, married in 1731 John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford ; Diana, Princess of Wales (born Lady Diana Spencer), daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, married in 1981 Charles, Prince of Wales, and had issue. ; Clarissa Spencer-Churchill, daughter of Jack Spencer-Churchill (younger brother of Sir Winston Churchill), married Sir Anthony Eden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. ; Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, married Clementine \n\n of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and Lady Anne Churchill.

On February 3, China and Russia blocked the United Nations Security Council from issuing a statement condemning the military for fear of additional economic sanctions. While the PRC initially downplayed the military coup as \"a major cabinet reshuffle\", it later expressed concern over the 12-month emergency declared by military leader Min Aung Hlaing, demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's US$1.3 million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people. Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose non-violence as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, \"I do not hold to non-violence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons.\" The decision of the Nobel Committee mentions: \"The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 to Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (Burma) for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. ...

The next day George Monbiot, \n\n In 2017, critics called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the persecution of Rohingya people in Myanmar. Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority. In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens. In a 2013 interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Aung San Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and \n\n Rohingya and the Kachin minority groups. The Myanmar leader and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was criticized for her silence over the issue and for supporting the military actions. Subsequently, in November 2017, the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal to facilitate the return of Rohingya refugees to their native Rakhine state within two months, drawing a mixed response from international onlookers. According to the United Nations reports, as of January 2018, nearly 690,000 Rohingya people had fled or had been driven out of Rakhine state who then took shelter in the neighboring Bangladesh as refugees.\n\nQuestion: Aung San Suu Kyi is a controversial leader in which country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1933, ten writers met to discuss revitalizing the SWG as union under the protection of laws governing unions under consideration by Congress and eventually embodied in the Wagner Act of 1935. They included Donald Ogden Stewart, Charles Brackett, John Bright, Philip Dunne, Dorothy Parker and Howard J. Green; the union's first president. Others active in the 1930s included Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Ogden Nash, Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Maurice Rapf.

Mayer. Mayer left in 1918 to form his own studio. Metro did most of its productions in Los Angeles and in New York City, where it occasionally leased facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Among Metro's productions were: The Eternal Question (1916) with Olga Petrova, The Divorceé (1919) with Ethel Barrymore, and What People Will Say? (1915) directed by Alice Guy-Blache. In 1919, when Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, Douglas Fairbanks, and Mary Pickford formed United Artists to protect their work and control \n\n In 1932, Small formed Reliance Pictures together with partner Harry M. Goetz. The new company was to be made with finance from Art Cinema, a subsidiary company of United Artists, in a deal brokered by Joseph Schenck. On the basis of this verbal commitment, Small and Goetz started pre production on three films. However, when Schenck presented the deal to Art Cinema's board, it was turned down. An embarrassed Schenck decided personally put up half the cost of the three films, with the other half met by Small and Goetz. The films were I Cover the Waterfront (1933), a crime drama based on a book with Claudette Colbert; Palooka (1934), a comedy based on the comic Joe Palooka with Jimmy Durante; and The Count of Monte Cristo (1934), a swashbuckler based on the Dumas novel starring Robert Donat and the first screen credit for \n\n Douglas Elton Fairbanks Sr. (born Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman; May 23, 1883 – December 12, 1939) was an American actor, screenwriter, director, and producer. He was best known for his swashbuckling roles in silent films including The Thief of Bagdad, Robin Hood, and The Mark of Zorro, but spent the early part of his career making comedies. Fairbanks was a founding member of United Artists. He was also a founding member of The Motion Picture Academy and hosted the 1st Academy Awards in 1929. With his marriage to actress and film producer Mary Pickford in 1920, the couple became 'Hollywood royalty', and Fairbanks was referred to as \"The King of Hollywood\", a nickname later passed on to actor Clark Gable. Though he was considered one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the 1910s and 1920s, Fairbanks's career rapidly declined with the advent of the \"talkies\". His final film was The Private Life of Don Juan (1934).\n\n David Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film. Griffith's film The Birth of a Nation (1915) made investors a profit, but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted African Americans in a negative light and glorified the Ku Klux Klan. Intolerance (1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including Broken Blossoms (1919), Way Down East (1920), and Orphans of the Storm (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, The Struggle (1931). Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, Griffith founded United Artists, enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios.\n\nQuestion: Which of the founders of United Artists had the last name nearest the beginning of the alphabet?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dugravier lives with his daughter Reine, his niece Louise and his servants Julie and Bertrand. The latter is in love with Julie but she favours Jasmin, a valet in a nearby house, visiting the Dugravier home. Dugravier decides to go to Paris with Bertrand to arrange marriages for Reine and Louise with the sons of two rich gentlemen. They depart at nightfall, through the bandit-ridden forest. With Dugravier gone, Louise confides to Julie that she has a lover, Charles, with whom she has an assignation that night, while Reine confesses that she too is to meet her own César. Charles, César and Jasmin hide upon the unexpected return of Dugravier, who says that he has met brigands on his way. The three young men then escape through a window, but return shortly after, claiming to have fought off the imaginary bandits. They introduce themselves as the two sons of the Parisians, and Dugravier gratefully agrees to all three marriages.\n\n Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Bergère. In a new revue, La Folie du Jour, in which she danced the number \"Fatou\" wearing a costume revealing all but a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Wearing only her loincloth of bananas, Baker suggestively performed \"danse sauvage\" to a Charleston tempo – a genre still new to Europe. Her French producer Jacques-Charles produced her dance numbers with French preconceptions of eroticized savages in mind. Baker performed the piece mostly nude with her partner, Joe Alex. This dance inspired a 1929 tempera painting titled Josephine Baker, first shown by the painter Ivanhoe Gambini in an exhibition \n\n The Théâtre des Noctambules was a former Parisian cabaret established in 1894 by the chansonnier Martial Boyer (1872–1941) and located at 7 rue Champollion in the 5th arrondissement of Paris (Latin Quarter). In 1939, Pierre Leuris and Jean Claude turned it into a theatre. Fernand Voiturin became manager in 1952 until the venue closed down in June 1956, when the theatre was turned into a Revival house (Art et Essai) under the same name. The Bald Soprano by Eugène Ionesco premiered in this venue in 1950.\n\n  Le Crazy Horse Saloon or Le Crazy Horse de Paris is a Parisian cabaret known for its stage shows performed by nude female dancers and for the diverse range of magic and variety 'turns' between each nude show and the next. Its owners have helped to create related cabaret and burlesque shows in other cities. Unrelated businesses have used the phrase \"Crazy Horse\" in their names. The Paris Crazy Horse occupies former wine cellars (12 in all, which have been combined) of an impressive Haussmanian building at 12 Avenue George-V (from the British king George V, in French \"George Cinq\"). Alain Bernardin opened it in 1951 and personally operated it for decades \n\n His first professional job was in a touring production in Germany of Molière's Les Fourberies de Scapin. In 1948, he began his career in the theatre with Robert Dhéry in Les Branquignols. His first film was Ah! Les belles bacchantes, starring Robert Dhéry, Colette Brosset (Dhéry's then-wife), and Louis de Funès; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954. Serrault played in the 1955 suspense thriller Les diaboliques, starring Simone Signoret and directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. From February 1973 through 1978, he portrayed the role of Albin/Zaza opposite Jean Poiret in the play La cage aux folles, written by Poiret. He recreated the role for the film version of the play, which was released in 1978. Serrault died from relapsing polychondritis at his home in Équemauville on 29 July 2007 at age 79. He was buried in Sainte-Catherine's cemetery in Honfleur and was transferred in 2009 to the cemetery of Neuilly-sur-Seine near his wife Juanita Saint-Peyron and daughter Caroline, who died in 1977.

He is particularly interested in archive materials (books, manuscripts, recordings) and has a vast repertoire of tunes of traditional and more contemporary origin, as well as from other folk music genres. Connolly absorbed much of the music of Sliabh Luachra through the playing of his mother. As a fiddle player, Connolly has his own unique style of playing which was heavily influenced by playing with his mother and uncle, as well as his mentor Tomás MacUileagóid.

The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. Later in the song, an issue involving an argument between two men about selling the other person a horse and delivering a mule creates a ruckus in the village.

Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for South Pacific, knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best. She also said that Rodgers and Hammerstein listened to all her suggestions and she worked extremely well with them. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for the lead in the film version of South Pacific and she reportedly wanted the part. They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband Martin Melcher would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to Mitzi Gaynor.\n\n \"A Wonderful Guy\" is a show tune from the 1949 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific. It was first introduced by Mary Martin in the original Broadway production and sung by Mitzi Gaynor in the 1958 film adaptation. In the show, Nellie sings this song after being convinced that despite the racial differences between her and Emile, there is good in him. And so she is elated to be in love with him. Rodgers and Hammerstein were as inspired by Mary Martin's personality as they were by the character of Nellie Forbush to write this song. They introduced it to Mary Martin one night when they were at Joshua Logan's house fine-tuning the script. Hammerstein wrote this song to express the exuberance of Nellie's character at this point in the show, and it carried over to Mary Martin's performance of it. Mary Martin was so thrilled that when she sang it on stage, she performed cartwheels on the stage at every turn of \"I'm in love.\"\n\n The Original Soundtrack to the film South Pacific was released in 1958. The film was based on the 1949 musical South Pacific by Rodgers and Hammerstein. The composers had much say in this recording, with many of the songs performed by accomplished singers rather than the actors in the film. Mitzi Gaynor and Ray Walston (who had played Luther Billis in the original national tour and in the original London production) were the only two leading performers who did their own singing in the film (and on the soundtrack album). The roles of Emile DeBecque, Bloody Mary and Joe Cable were sung by Giorgio Tozzi, Muriel Smith (who \n\n South Pacific (also known as Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific) is a 2001 American romantic musical television film based on the 1949 stage musical of the same name, itself an adaptation of James A. Michener's 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific. Directed by Richard Pearce, the film stars Glenn Close, Harry Connick Jr. and Rade Šerbedžija (credited as Rade Sherbedgia). The screenplay, adapted by Joshua Logan (who directed the previous 1958 film version) and Lawrence D. Cohen, tells the story of a war-torn romance between a young American nurse (Close) and an older French plantation owner (Sherbedgia). The film premiered on March 26, 2001 on ABC to mixed critical reviews, praising its performances but criticizing the rearranged song order and removal of certain numbers that have been singled out for being politically incorrect.\n\nQuestion: South Pacific was set during which war?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition, European countries have dependencies among the offshore islands of Africa: Spain (the Canary Islands and the islands of the plazas de soberanía); France (Mayotte, Réunion, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean); Portugal (the Azores, Madeira, and the Savage Islands); and the United Kingdom (Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha). Consequently, the geography of the African Union is wildly diverse, including the world's largest hot desert (the Sahara), huge jungles and savannas, and the world's longest river (the Nile). The AU has an area of 29922059 km2, with 24165 km of coastline. The vast majority of this area is on continental Africa, while the only significant territories off the mainland are the island of Madagascar (the world's largest microcontinent and fourth-largest island) and the Sinai Peninsula (geographically a part of Asia), accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total area.\n\n  Asia is a landmass variously described as part of Eurasia or as Earth's largest and most populous continent in its own right, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 km2, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population. In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, \n\n Europe is a landmass variously recognised as part of Eurasia or a continent in its own right, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the \n\n  The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 106460000 km2. It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It is known to separate the \"Old World\" of Africa, Europe and Asia from the \"New World\" of the Americas in the European perception of the World. The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, by the Equatorial Counter Current, with the North(ern) Atlantic Ocean and the South(ern) Atlantic Ocean at about 8°N. Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.\n\n Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62800 km. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically. The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent.

President Jacques Delors had his Commission's mandate extended to 23 January 1995, at which point the Santer Commission took office. The new European Union introduced the pillar system, formalising European Political Cooperation as the Common Foreign and Security Policy and adding the new area of Justice and Home Affairs. Maastricht also established the Committee of the Regions, which held its inaugural session on 9 to 10 March 1994 with the election of Jacques Blanc as its president. Furthermore, on 25 May, the European Investment Fund was established by the EIB and the European Police Office was created on 26 July 1995 with the signing of the Europol convention.\n\n from the Pan-European Picnic in 1989. The finals brought the division of the Soviet Union into 15 non-communist states in 1991. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,: Following the end of the Cold War, the European Economic Community pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic \n\n In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.\n\n The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is one of two treaties forming the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU), the other being the Treaty on European Union (TEU; also referred to as the Treaty of Maastricht). It was previously known as Treaty Establishing the European Community (TEC). The Treaty originated as the Treaty of Rome (fully the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and \n\n The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed in Rome on 29 October 2004 by 53 senior political figures from the 25 member states of the European Union. In most cases heads of state designated plenipotentiaries to sign the treaty, but some presidents also signed on behalf of states which were republics.

EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term \"champagne\" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne.

These services connect a city's Central railway station to important locations such as a city's port or airport, as well as its suburbs and occasionally nearby towns and cities. As of September 2020, there are three Proastiakos networks, serving the country's three largest cities: Athens, Thessaloniki and Patras, providing them with commuter rail links towards their suburbs and also with regional services to other cities and towns. In 2016, the three systems carried 10.1 million passengers. As of 8 January 2017, the lines \n\n  The Athens Metro is operated by Stasy S.A (Statheres Sygkoinonies S.A) which is a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation) and provides public transport throughout the Athens Urban Area. While its main purpose is transport, it also houses Greek artifacts found during construction of the system. The Athens Metro has an operating staff of 387 and runs three metro lines; namely the Line 1 (Green), Line 2 (Red) and line 3 (Blue) lines, of which the first was constructed in 1869, and the other two largely during the 1990s, with the initial sections opened in January 2000. The line 1 for the most part runs at ground level and the other two (lines 2,3) routes run entirely underground (except the doukisis plakentias-Airport section) and a fleet of 42 trains consisting of 252 cars operate within the network, with a daily occupancy of 1,353,000 passengers.\n\n other European destinations through the city's central bus station. Beovoz was the suburban/commuter railway network that provided mass-transit services in the city, similar to Paris's RER and Toronto's GO Transit. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways. However, this system was abolished back in 2013, mostly due to introduction of more efficient BG Voz. Belgrade is one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro or subway or other rapid transit system. As of November 2021, Belgrade Metro is currently under construction, which will have 2 lines. The first line \n\n Piraeus–Monastiraki–Iraklio–Lavrio–Kifissia The first railway line that operated in Greece was the one connecting Athens and its port Piraeus, which opened in 1869. It ran for a distance of 8 km from the port of Piraeus to Thissio in center of Athens. It was later extended to Omonoia Square in 1895 and electrified in 1904, with the 600 V DC third rail system. From 1911 it was also possible to run through freight trains on the Piraeus Harbour Tramway using dual system electric locomotives.  Another company, Attica Railways in 1885, ran a metre-gauge suburban line from Lavrio Square to the north of Omonoia Square and to Iraklio (a northern suburb). It involved a section of street running, along the present 3 September \n\n most stations were built underground well before this became a consideration. The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle). The system expanded quickly until World War I and the core was complete by the 1920s; extensions into suburbs were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations. Besides the Métro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (developed from the 1960s), ten tramway lines (developed from the 1990s) \n\nQuestion: Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The cartoon depicts Mickey Mouse conducting a symphony orchestra sponsored by Pete. The film was directed by Riley Thomson and features music adapted from the \"Light Cavalry Overture\" by Franz von Suppé. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Billy Bletcher as Pete, and John McLeish as a radio announcer. It was the 117th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the second for that year. The film marked the last theatrical appearance of Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, and Clara Cluck for over 40 years, finally reappearing in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). Symphony Hour is also the last time that Mickey appeared with either Donald Duck or Goofy in a theatrical film for the same length of time. Symphony Hour bears similarities with the 1935 film The Band Concert. Leonard Maltin called this short a \"Spike Jones version of The Band Concert\". The soundtrack for the \"ruined\" version of the Light Cavalry Overture was used in the October 22, 1956 episode of The Mickey Mouse Club.\n\n would soon start to contemplate ways to distinguish the Mickey Mouse series from his previous work and that of his rivals. Minnie's role as performer and damsel in distress is solidified in this. It is also the first time she wears her distinctive oversized high-heeled pumps, although they fall off when she is kidnapped and she spends the rest of the cartoon shoeless. Mickey is also seen wearing shoes for the first time, and as the years went by animators would change Mickey Mouse. In the first three Mickey Mouse shorts, he is a character meant to appeal to adult sensibilities; he smokes, drinks, and cavorts. Soon after Walt and his animators revised their star (for the first, but not for the last time), after which Mickey Mouse became the \"wholesome\" character designed to appeal to children and to please parents.\n\n Mickey's Service Station is a 1935 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The film, which stars Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy as car mechanics, was also the final black-and-white appearance of Donald, Goofy, and Pete and the penultimate animated black-and-white film produced by Disney after Mickey's Kangaroo which was released later the same year. It was also the first team-up of the classic trio of Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. Mickey's Service Station was directed by Ben Sharpsteen, who at the time had directed only Silly Symphony shorts, and starred the voices of Walt Disney, Clarence Nash, Pinto Colvig, and Billy Bletcher. It was the 74th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the third of that year. The cartoon has been colorized and is available in color on YouTube and on DVD versions of Disney's House of Mouse.\n\n Thomson began his career in 1935 at Leon Schlesinger Productions (Warner Bros.) as an animator. While there he worked on Merrie Melodies cartoons and focused on the character Porky Pig. The following year Thomson went to work at Walt Disney Productions. He was first an animator and worked on Mickey Mouse, Silly Symphonies, and Donald Duck short films. He also worked on the feature-length film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" segment of Fantasia (1940). After working on Fantasia Thomson moved to the story department where he became a writer and director. He directed the short films Put-Put Troubles (1940), The Little Whirlwind (1941), The Nifty Nineties (1941), the 1941 remake of Orphans' Benefit, Mickey's Birthday Party (1942), and \n\n The Dognapper is a 1934 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The cartoon stars Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck as police officers who chase Pegleg Pete after he dognaps Fifi, Minnie Mouse's pet Pekingese. The film was directed by David Hand and features the voices of Clarence Nash as Mickey and Donald and Billy Bletcher as Pete. It was the 70th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the eighth of that year. This was the first and only time that Mickey was voiced by Nash; Walt was in Europe at the time and was unavailable to record his lines for Mickey, thus, Nash took over. The Dognapper was Donald's third film and was the first adventure story to feature both Mickey and Donald. This was the second of only three B&W cartoons to feature Donald Duck (the other two being Orphan's Benefit and Mickey's Service Station). Because the color of Donald's feet doesn't show in black and white, his feet were black in these cartoons.\n\nQuestion: Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It centres on Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan) a coldly scientific, atheist veterinarian, his seven-year-old daughter Mary (Karen Dotrice), and her cat Thomasina (voiced by Elspeth March), who narrates the film. (Thomasina was originally called \"Thomas\" by her adoptive family. She explains that they amended her name \"when they, well, got to know me better.\") Dr. MacDhui is a widower.

One day, Elizabeth's Uncle Henry purchases the dollhouse and the dolls for his niece, Elizabeth, and the dolls are wrapped, put inside a box, and sent to tropics where Elizabeth lives. En route, the dolls wreck on a ship, and finally they drift on an uninhabited tropical island, together with their dollhouse. They gradually get adapted to the island. Getting familiar with the native animals, they explore all over the island with curiosity. At the end of the story, Mrs. Doll proposes leaving Floating Island. All other dolls disagree with her, but they decide to leave there because \"dolls need children, and children need dolls\" said Mrs. Doll. They raise a signal fire, and then one sailor sees the signal and finds the dollhouse, dolls, and a strange monkey wearing little green trousers. The story doesn't tell the future of the dolls, but it is concluded by asking readers whether or not they have the doll and \"If you think they are, will you tell me?\"\n\n The splintercat is a fearsome critter in the folklore of the United States. The splintercat is a nocturnal feline of great ferocity. It flies through the air with terrific speed and when it hits a large tree, it knocks the branches off, withers the trunk, and leaves it standing like a silvery ghost. These dead snags can be seen in many parts of the Pacific Northwest. The splinter cat performs this feat that it is named after to expose raccoons and bees. However, the act of breaking open trees with its head leaves it with a constant headache, which causes it always to be in a foul mood. Accordingly, one is advised to never approach a splintercat. Splintercat Creek, found in the northern Cascade Range of Oregon, is named after this legendary animal. The splintercat appears in the 1974 children's book The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles by Julie Andrews Edwards. This particular splintercat answers to the Prime Minister of Whangdoodland and also enjoys playing cat's cradle.\n\nEdward Eager (1911–1964) – Half Magic, Magic by the Lake, Knight's Castle, The Time Garden, The Well-Wishers, Magic or Not, Seven-Day Magic ; Marion Eames (1921–2007) – Sionyn a Siarli, Huw a'r Adar Aur, Y Tir Tywyll (in Welsh) ; Martin Ebbertz (born 1962) – Little Mr. Jaromir ; Irmengarde Eberle (1898–1979) ; Walter D.

It is introduced to the protagonists Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the antagonist 'Prock' (the Whangdoodle's second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity. With Prock persuaded to grant their passage, the children discover that the Whangdoodle is oppressed by want of a mate, and convince Savant to create the latter.

The humorous \"He's a Go Getter\" plays on an unexpected pun, \"When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get 'er.\" Parton also covers the Jeannie C. Riley hit \"Harper Valley PTA\", Tammy Wynette's \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\", and Porter Wagoner's hit, \"The Carroll County Accident\". Parton re-recorded the title song for her 1973 album My Tennessee Mountain Home. Parton re-recorded \"The Carroll County Accident\" with Buck Trent for his 2018 album Spartanburg Blues.\n\n The series went on to flesh out the story in the song, as it told of the adventures of Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden), a widowed single mother to teenager Dee (Jenn Thompson), who lived in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio. The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr (George Gobel). Mrs. Johnson's flouting of the small town's conventions, and exposure of the hypocrisy of many of its other notorious residents provided the humour. Her most notable foes were the wealthy and completely snobbish Reilly family, which consisted of the snobby head of the family, Flora (Anne Francine); her snotty daughter, Wanda (Bridget Hanley); her husband, Bobby, (Rod McCary) and their daughter, \n\n singer/songwriter Tom T. Hall about a miniskirt-wearing widowed mother of a teenage girl who was criticized by local school officials for supposedly setting a bad example for her daughter. The song was recorded by a young secretary named Jeannie C. Riley, who developed a mod persona in connection with the song by performing onstage in short skirts and go-go boots. Other female country artists began to follow suit in the years that followed, also appearing onstage in miniskirts and minidresses. The song reached both the country and pop charts in 1968; and to this day, \"Harper Valley PTA\" remains the most \n\n Riley, who was working as a secretary in Nashville for Jerry Chesnut, got to hear the song and recorded it herself and it became a massive hit for her. The single's jump from 81 to 7 in its second week on the Billboard Hot 100 in late August 1968 is the decade's highest climb into that chart's Top Ten. Riley's version won her a Grammy for the Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Her recording was also nominated for \"Record of the Year\" and \"Song of the Year\" in the pop field. The song later inspired an eponymous 1978 motion picture and short-lived 1981 television series, both starring Barbara Eden playing the heroine of the story, Mrs. Johnson, who now had a first name, Stella. In the 1970s, Riley became a born-again Christian, and though she briefly distanced herself from the song when she began singing gospel music, she never excluded it from her concerts, and it was always her most requested and popular number. She titled her 1980 autobiography From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top, and released a gospel album in 1981 with the same title.\n\n Harper Valley PTA (known simply as Harper Valley during its second season) is an American sitcom television series based on the 1978 film of the same name, which was itself based on the 1968 country song of the same name recorded by singer Jeannie C. Riley and written by Tom T. Hall. The series, starring Barbara Eden who reprised her role from the film, aired on NBC from January 16, 1981 to August 14, 1982.\n\nQuestion: Who was the star of the film based on the record Harper Valley PTA by Jeannie C Riley?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His wife, Nel, was an artist and produced the distinctive and enduring circular emblem that Dr Law described as \"...a circular badge whose centre is the Antarctic Continent with the Australian sector shaded. Surrounding this is an annular set of designs depicting flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Sub-Antarctic Islands\". The main ANARE emblem was, in Dr Law's words, \"too complex to reproduce as a lapel badge or as a logo on aircraft, vehicles or flags.\" Dr Law saw potential in the leopard seal as a simplified ANARE symbol. \"I was struck with the possibility \n\n The game is played similarly to golf, with the exception that players use a football-soccer ball instead of a golf ball, and the ball is kicked rather than struck with a club, working toward a 50 cm-52 cm diameter by 28 cm deep \"FootGolf cup\" usually located away from golf greens.

One-piece balls are made of a single kind of plastic resin, shaped into a sphere and hardened. They are the most durable kind of ball but their performance is limited by the properties of the resin. These balls are also the cheapest and often available as rentals at park golf courses. Two-piece balls have an inner core and outer covering made of different materials. By combining two materials, the advantages of both can be used in the same ball. For example, a ball may have a durable resin core, \n\n formalising a sketch of the creature to produce a geometrical pattern of straight lines....I drew it in the national colours of gold and green.\" That symbol served until 1985, when a new 'globe' logo based on the Australian and Antarctic continents was developed by the AAD. At the same time the term ANARE fell out of official use the 'globe' logo was also discarded in favour of the Australian coat of arms to bring the livery of the AAD in line with the rest of the Australian Public Service. However like the ANARE name the logo continues to be used on an informal basis by expeditioners each year in the production of Antarctic Station badges, T-shirts and other memorabilia.\n\n The durable plastic resin balls are bright-coloured so they can be easily distinguished from a distance. They come in many colours but are all 60 mm in diameter and less than 100 grams. Balls may be made of a single or multiple components and individual manufactures' balls all perform slightly differently. It is not unusual to see players with several balls for use in different conditions.\n\nQuestion: What color golf balls are used on the golf course in Antarctica?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Originally released as the B-side of his first single, \"Maybellene\", it went on to become a hit, reaching number 10 in the Billboard R&B chart. The song is a twelve-bar blues, described as \"a slow, sensuous blues featuring some exceptional piano from Johnnie Johnson\". \"Wee Wee Hours\" was on the audition tape submitted by Berry to Leonard Chess in hope of landing a recording contract with Chess Records. Although it seemed like a good fit with the record company's blues roster, Chess was more interested in the song that became \"Maybellene\", the song that launched Berry's career as a rock and roll star. Berry often performed the song live. It is included on the 1969 album Chuck Berry Live in Concert, and in the 1987 film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.\n\n Berry's version was originally released as a single by Chess Records in May 1956, with \"Drifting Heart\" as the B-side. It peaked at number two on the Billboard R&B chart and number 29 on the pop chart. \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and three other Berry songs were included on the album Rock, Rock, Rock, promoted as the soundtrack of the film of the same name, but only four of the 12 songs on the album were used in the film. \"Roll Over Beethoven\" has been released numerous times on compilation albums, including Chuck Berry Twist and The Chess Box.\n\n Jamar Chess is the son of Robin and Marshall Chess. His grandfather is Leonard Chess, who started Chess Records in Chicago in 1950. Chess Records was the label of artists including Chuck Berry, Etta James, Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and Muddy Waters. Chess's father, Marshall Chess, is a record producer who formed Rolling Stones Records in 1970, which he ran for seven years. He helped create The Rolling Stones tongue and lip logo, and was executive producer on seven Rolling Stone albums. As a young man, Chess worked at Arc Music Group, the publishing arm of Chess Records, managing the blues catalog. He later became creative director of the company, He also held the Creative A&R International position where he managed the company's international operations. He worked with the company's catalog and focused on remix projects, digital licensing and synchronization licensing.\n\n An overview of Berry's Chess recordings, it contains every 45 rpm single released by Berry on the Chess label from his debut in 1955 through March 1965 with the exceptions of the holiday record \"Merry Christmas, Baby,\" \"Anthony Boy,\" \"Chuck's Beat\" with Bo Diddley, and \"Little Marie.\" This does not include content from every released EP single, but of the 28 A-sides from this time period, 14 were top ten hits on the Billboard R&B singles chart and ten were Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. It also includes an additional three singles, \"Tulane\" from 1970, \"Bio\" from 1973, \n\nQuestion: On which label did Chuck Berry record in the 1950s and 1960s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is primarily renowned for its extensive paintings collection, which covers all artistic evolutions. In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The painting holdings include works by painters such as Veronese, Rubens, Zurbarán, Ingres, Delacroix, Renoir, Gauguin, Signac, Monet, Matisse, Picasso, Kandinsky, Joan Miró, Paul Klee, Giorgio de Chirico and Andy Warhol. The museum also presents a few Egyptian antiquities as well as Greek and Roman artifacts. The Sculpture collection features works by Auguste Rodin, Matisse, Alberto Giacometti and Alexander Calder. In April 2010, the prophetess of Antinoe, a 6th-century mummy discovered in 1907 in the Coptic necropolis of Antinoe in Middle Egypt, returned to the Museum of Grenoble, after more than fifty years of absence and an extensive restoration.\n\n The Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the director of the museum. The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially \"the Met\", is the largest art museum in the United States. With 6,953,927 visitors to its three locations in 2018, it was the third most visited art museum in the world. Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among seventeen curatorial departments. The director, currently Max Hollein, is responsible for acting as a \"curator, lawyer and diplomat\", according to The Wall Street Journal. They produce around 40 exhibits at the museum a year, manage the museums' approximately 2,200 employees, and oversee the collection and curatorial departments. The Director currently reports to Daniel H. Weiss, President and CEO of the Museum. The director typically has had a large degree \n\n most famous masterpiece in the museum is Picasso's 1937 painting Guernica. Along with its extensive collection, the museum offers a mixture of national and international temporary exhibitions in its many galleries, making it one of the world's largest museums for modern and contemporary art. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it attracted only 1,248,480 visitors, a drop of 72 percent from 2019, but it still ranked sixth on the list of most-visited art museums in the world. It also hosts a free-access library specializing in art, with a collection of over 100,000 books, over 3,500 sound recordings, and almost 1,000 videos.\n\n Special exhibitions at the High feature strong global partnerships with other museums such as the Louvre and with the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore and the Opificio delle pietre dure in Florence. In 2008, the museum inked a US$18 million deal for Louvre Atlanta, a three-year revolving loan of art from the Musée du Louvre in Paris, resulting in the museum's highest attendance ever. Its most popular individual show was 2009's Louvre Atlanta: the Louvre and the Masterpiece. The museum is also a Smithsonian Institution Affiliate.\n\n The J. Paul Getty Trust is the world's wealthiest art institution, with an estimated endowment of US$7.7 billion in 2020. Based in Los Angeles, California, it operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, which has two locations – the Getty Center in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. Its other programs are the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute. With an estimated 1.6 million visitors per year, the trust operates one of the most visited museums in the United States. The trust also provides grants and training to other museums and cultural institutions. The trust has a library, publications program and visiting scholar program. The trust's conservation program is dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. However, since 2008, the trust has scaled back the scope of its activities in response to financial challenges.\n\nQuestion: Which museum has the highest-funded art gallery?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He first became famous as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. Jackson said he had been physically abused by his father and had not had a childhood.\n\nAs an adult Jackson's appearance began to change, as his nose became thinner and his skin lightened. Media reports and criticism stated that he wanted to look more white and had extensive cosmetic surgery that resulted in a public discussion about his mental health. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. Later he revealed that he had been diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition, he used makeup to even out his skin. When the condition got worse Jackson used prescription creams to depigment his skin.\n\nOver years a lot of different rumors about Jackson's sexuality and the paternity of his children circulated. In 2005 he was acquitted on child sexual abuse.\n\nAfter suffering from burns on his skull and a back injury Jackson had to take painkillers for the rest of his life. In 1993 he became gradually dependent on these drugs and went into rehabilitation. Jackson also suffered from dehydration and insomnia.\n\nWhile preparing for a series of London comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nSkin diseases\n\nVitiligo\nJackson suffered from vitiligo, a condition characterized by depigmentation of the skin occurring in patches. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it is believed to be due to genetic susceptibility triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs. He said it had begun after the release of Thriller. By that time he hadn't known what it was. Initially Jackson tried to cover the vitiligo spots with black make-up because he thought his appearance would have a negative impact on his career. Jackson's dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he had diagnosed Jackson with vitiligo in 1986. The singer contradicted media reports saying he was trying to look more white.\n\nIn 1993 Jackson revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was suffering from vitiligo. About skin bleaching he said: “There is no such thing as skin bleaching. I’ve never seen it.” Jackson said he would use make up to even it out. Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, then a relatively unknown condition. Jackson was criticized for hiding it by bleaching, and some even cast doubt on whether he suffered from vitiligo.\n\nIn late 1993 Jackson's skin disorder became relevant for the investigations into sexual child abuse accusations against him. A search warrant was served on Jackson allowing authorities to examine and photograph any part of the singer's body including his private parts. Jackson said they supposedly looked for evidence of vitiligo. Media reports stated that the alleged victim had given the police a detailed description of Jackson's body.\n\nShortly after Jackson's death, FDA-approved creams to treat vitiligo (Benoquin and hydroquinone) had been found in Jackson's residence. The creams remove and lighten the remaining pigment. Klein said in a TV show the vitiligo had become too severe to even it out with makeup and his skin had to be depigmented with creams. It remained stable but Jackson had to repeat the treatment from time to time. Klein said Jackson had been very devoted to treating vitiligo. The treatment may be recommended for adults who have vitiligo on more than 50% of their bodies, to depigment the remaining pigment and make it the same color as the depigmented skin. Darkening depigmented skin is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk of contracting melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for \"Remember the Time\", all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid drawing attention to his skin.\n\nWorld Vitiligo Day is held on Jackson's passing day. It was initially established to raise awareness for the autoimmune disease. The event is also dedicated to educate physicians and raise money for research.\n\nLupus\nJackson's dermatologist Arnold Klein said Jackson had initially come to him for acne treatment. The physician had recognized lupus on Jackson's scalp at their first encounter. Klein had done a biopsy and had diagnosed Jackson with lupus erythematosus.\n\nCosmetic procedures\n\nNose surgeries\nMedia reports state Jackson had extensive surgery on his nose. Jackson contradicted those reports in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk saying he only had had two rhinoplasties.\nShortly after Jackson's death Klein stated that he had rebuilt Jackson's nose because its cartilage had totally collapsed and that he had been ’exquisitely sensitive to pain’. Medical records show that Klein administered Jackson demerol during procedures. Jackson had told Patrick Treacy that he been suffering from a facial hypersensitivity caused by a botched cosmetic surgery. Jackson's second wife Debbie Rowe, who had met Jackson while she had been working for Klein, said she had been designated to help him through procedures.\n\nIn 2017 British broadcaster Sky canceled the airing of an episode of Urban Myths which cast Joseph Fiennes to portray Jackson with heavy white makeup and a constructed nose. The cancelation came after Jackson's family had expressed concerns in public.\n\nFacial structure\n\nSurgeons speculated he also had a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery and altered his lips.\nJackson however, said that he had a dimple created in his chin attributing the other changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. He also denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. Jackson said he had a tough time when he reached puberty. People hadn't recognized expecting 'cute Michael' they used to know, and Jackson said they had seemed to be surprised that he was undergoing natural changes during puberty. In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson was asked about his cheeks; he answered: \"These cheekbones? No. My father has the same thing. We have Indian blood.\"\n\nPhysical health\n\nBurns and scalp surgery\n\nIn early 1984, Jackson's hair caught fire during a commercial shoot. Jackson stated the fire had been caused by sparks of magnesium flash bombs exploding only two feet away from either side of his head, totally disregarding safety regulations. Later that day the hospital announced that Jackson was in stable condition and doing well. A spokesman said the patient had suffered second-degree burns on his skull and would be transferred to Brotman Medical Center's special burn unit. Jackson said he had suffered third-degree burns on the back of his head that had almost gone through his skull, and that it had caused him a lot of problems. Over a period of several years balloon implants had been inserted to stretch the affected area and cut out the scars in order to restore his hair. In November 1993, Jackson announced the cancellation of the remaining Dangerous Tour due to a dependence on painkillers which had been prescribed after a recent constructive scalp surgery. The efforts to restore his hair failed and Jackson finally decided to wear a wig.\n\nDehydration\nIn August 1993, two shows of Jackson's Dangerous Tour in Thailand had to be canceled due to dehydration. Following these cancelations Coca-Cola, rival of Jackson's sponsor Pepsi, ran a controversial advertisement in Bangkok's English-language newspapers posing ‘Dehydrated? There‘s always a Coke‘. On August 27, 1993, Jackson \"returned to the concert stage\".\nA few days later Jackson complained of nausea and a severe headache. His physician stated Jackson had suffered from a migraine a few weeks before and that the dehydration might have intensified it. Jackson underwent a MRI scan which was entirely normal. A specialist confirmed Forecast's diagnosis of \"late-onset migraine,\" and medication was prescribed for Jackson. Jackson consumed a lot of water, preventing dehydration and voice problems.\nIn late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance. Medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities.\nIn June 2003 Jackson had been briefly hospitalized before a deposition in a copyright matter. A physician had stated Jackson was weak, dizzy and dehydrated. He had been treated with intravenous fluids and a tranquilizer. A lawyer for Jackson stated Jackson ‘sometimes became nervous and failed to eat when faced with depositions‘. An emergency physician and Jackson's personal physician had provided affidavits regarding Jackson's health. The deposition was postponed.\n\nOrthopedic problems\nIn June 1990, Jackson was admitted to a Santa Monica hospital with chest pains. According to Mark Zatzkis, \"laboratory and X-ray tests of Jackson's heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities\"; the pains \"were caused by bruised ribs suffered during a vigorous dance practice\".\nThe first concert in Santiago de Chile, scheduled for October 21, 1993, was canceled due to lumbar problems; two days later, Jackson performed at Estadio Nacional. Another concert in Lima, Peru, scheduled for October 26, 1993, was canceled due to a torn muscle suffered during a show in Brazil.\nJackson suffered a back injury in July 1997 after one of the stages collapsed during a concert in Munich, Germany. However, the History Tour continued.\nOn March 10, 2005, Jackson appeared late in court after having received treatment in a hospital due to a back problem. The judge ordered him to appear in court under the penalty of arrest and forfeiture of his bail. Jackson appeared in court wearing a T-shirt, a blazer, pajama bottoms and slippers. On March 21, Jackson arrived in court accompanied by a doctor. It is believed that he suffered from back problems again. A conversation between the judge and the lawyers regarding the matter was sealed. During the trial, Jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat. On June 5, 2005, Jackson was taken to the emergency room at the Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital to seek treatment of a back pain. Jackson's spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, said \"stress contributed to the back problem.\"\n\nViral infections and voice problems\n\nOn March 12, 1988, Jackson canceled a show in St. Louis which was rescheduled to March 14; on March 13, Jackson performed in St. Louis although he was fighting a cold. The cold progressed to laryngitis; the show on March 14 was also canceled.\nThree shows in Tacoma, scheduled from October 31 to November 2, 1988, had to be canceled on his physician's advice because Jackson had the flu. Two shows in Los Angeles were canceled due to swollen vocal cords; three shows in Los Angeles scheduled for November 20, 21 and 22 were also canceled; these five concerts were rescheduled for January 1989.\nIn August 1992, a concert in London, England had to be postponed due to a viral infection. Four days later, Jackson performed in Cardiff, Wales. In September 1992, a concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany was canceled because Jackson was ill with the flu.  In October 1992, a concert in Istanbul and another in Izmir, Turkey had to be canceled due to loss of voice caused by a cold. His private doctor attended to Jackson in Istanbul. According to organizers, Jackson's \"vocal cords were irritated.\" These concerts were supposed to be the last three shows of the tour's European leg. Jackson was seen by a throat specialist in London and was advised to seek further treatment in Los Angeles.\nPeople around Jackson took precautions to keep him healthy. One of the measures was that Jackson wore a surgical mask during air travel. Later he transformed it into a fashion accessory wearing a silk mask in black with jewel tones.\nOn February 15, 2005, Jackson was admitted to Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria with \"flu-like symptoms.\" According to Chuck Merrill, Jackson was in stable condition and would recover within a few days. Jackson left the hospital on February 16, 2005; Todd Bailey said Jackson \"continued to need care for some persistent viral symptoms, but otherwise he was in good spirits.\" One week later, the jury selection for the child molestation trial resumed in Jackson's presence.\n\nDental problems\nIn 1993 several concerts in Mexico City were canceled due to tooth problems. Two abscessed molars were pulled.\n\nAmbulance transport and hospitalization\nIn 1992 an ambulance took Jackson back to his hotel after the show In Lausanne, Switzerland; another show in Basel was also canceled. \nIn 1999 Jackson was taken to a hospital with abrasions and bruises after a bridge, on which Jackson was standing during a charity concert in Munich, Germany, had been lowered too fast.\n\nInsomnia\nIn his final months Jackson was suffering from insomnia. Nurse Lee stated she spent one night in Jackson's residence to monitor his nighttime routine. Jackson went to bed with classical music playing on a sound system and Donald Duck playing on a computer. That night Jackson slept only for three hours. He told Lee: “All I want is to be able to sleep. I want to be able to sleep eight hours. I know I’ll feel better the next day.” Klein recalled Jackson couldn't sleep one night when he was on tour in Hawaii. Finally Klein and his office slept in Jackson's room. One of his lawyers said Jackson suffered from sleeplessness when he was under pressure: ”He gets upset, he doesn’t drink, he doesn’t eat, he can’t sleep. It gets to the point where he just can’t stand it. He is exhausted with this kind of thing.”\n\nDrug use\n\nPainkillers\n\nIn November 1993, Jackson announced that he was dependent on painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. In a taped statement Jackson said: \"The pressure resulting from these false allegations, coupled with the incredible energy necessary for me to perform, caused so much distress that it left me physically and emotionally exhausted. I became increasingly more dependent on the painkillers.\" His lawyers said Jackson would be treated for dependency overseas for one and a half months to two months. In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States.\n\nJackson's dependency was questioned by the lawyer who represented the boy accusing Jackson of sexual abuse. In November 1993 two lawyers, who had seen Jackson a few days before he had canceled his tour, described their impressions in a sworn declaration. A plaintiff's lawyer in a copyright matter stated he had been ”warned that the entertainer was taking painkillers because of recent oral surgery“ before questioning him. The lawyer stated he had seen ”no obvious effects of drug abuse“. One of Jackson's lawyers stated she had seen him the day before and had concluded he had been ’unfit to give testimony’ but ’seemed to be doing much better’ the next day when he had given the deposition. Jackson's lawyer said these swings had continued over the next few days. She said she had been ”deeply concerned“ about Jackson's health.\n\nPropofol\nCherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he had asked her for unspecified \"products for sleep\". On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, \"Michael, the only problem with you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up.\" Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before and that he had been told it was safe. After Jackson's death Lee said in an interview: “He wasn’t looking to get high or feel good and sedated from drugs. This was a person who was not on drugs. This was a person who was seeking help, desperately, to get some sleep, to get some rest.”\n\nPatrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who had treated Jackson while he had been living in Ireland in 2006, stated that he had never seen any drugs in the house and had never been asked for narcotics. Jackson had always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol had been administered.\n\nSexuality\n\nThere have been a lot of different rumors regarding Jackson's sexuality. People wondered whether he was homosexual or heterosexual. Some thought he was asexual. In the early 1980s, media reports stated that Jackson had never had a school chum or a steady girlfriend. Jackson later stated he had been too embarrassed to approach girls in school although he had liked them. He stated he had become romantically involved with actresses Tatum O'Neal and Brooke Shields.\nShields later denied that saying she had given him permission to say she is his girlfriend. In 1993 Oprah Winfrey asked him if he was a virgin, which Jackson refused to answer, saying that would be something very private. Winfrey later admitted that the question had been embarrassing. Later that year Jackson was accused of having sexually abused a boy. In 1994 Jackson married his first wife Lisa Marie Presley. Presley said in an interview that the couple had sex. In early 1996 Presley filed for divorce. At the end of that year Jackson announced that his longtime friend Debbie Rowe, who had been working as a nurse for Jackson's dermatologist, was six months pregnant with his baby. He denied reports stating Rowe had been inseminated artificially. They married one week later. Rowe is the mother of two of Jackson's children. Jackson later said that many single mothers have children and fathers should have the same opportunity. He said Rowe had wanted to do that for him as a present. In late 1999 she filed for divorce.  Speculations whether they had sex or not continue. Media reports state Jackson's third child was carried by a surrogate whose identity is unknown. Jackson said he had signed a  contractual agreement not to talk about her. During a child molestation trial against Jackson in 2005 prosecutors showed the jury a collection of heterosexual adult magazines that had been found during a police raid in 2003. The investigator who found the magazines testified they were legal. Jackson was later acquitted.\n\nMental health\n\nAppearance\nJackson's physical changes attracted widespread media coverage and criticism from the public. Some African-American psychologists argued that Jackson was a poor role model for black youth. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson had given \"black youth a feeling that they can achieve\", but might encourage them to believe they had to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful. Halford Fairchild said Jackson and other African-American celebrities would try \"to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television\".\nWhen Jackson was approached in 2003 about people thinking he was obsessed with cosmetic surgery because of his distressed childhood he replied: “Well, I know what’s inside my head. That’s all.“\n\nIn his interview in 1993 Jackson also talked about the impact the speculations about his skin color had on him. \"It is something I cannot help,\" said Jackson. \"When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that.\"\nJackson publicly said that he was proud to be black.\nJackson's paternity of his three children is questioned in public due to their light skin color.\nThe cosmetic surgeries are also regarded as an attempt to look white. Another theory says Jackson didn't want to look like his father. People close to Jackson say he didn't want to remove himself from the race.\n\nEccentric lifestyle\nIn September 1986 the National Enquirer reported Jackson would sleep in an oxygen chamber to turn 150. Later editor Nick Maier declared that the story wasn't true. He said a polaroid of Jackson lying in the chamber was provided by Jackson's press representative. Maier added: “Many celebrities try to create a buzz around themselves. And Michael Jackson did exactly that. In the end, that backfired…“ Jackson used his eccentric image to cover his skin condition before speaking about it in public.\n\nDepression\nJackson's daughter stated her father had suffered from depression and had been prescribed antidepressants. Jackson stated he used to cry from loneliness as a child starting at the age of eight or nine. Jackson said the acne had had a bad effect on his personality and depressed him. He hadn't looked at people when he had been talking and hadn't wanted to go out, but stated he had learned to feel better about himself and things had changed.\nJackson stated in his biography he had one of the most difficult periods in his life when he was making Off the Wall. He felt isolated having only very few close friends. He used to walk through his neighborhood hoping to meet somebody he could talk to and who might become a friend. ”Success definitely brings on loneliness“, he added. ”I’ve learned to cope better with these things and now I don’t get nearly as depressed as I used to“.\n\nChildhood\n\nIn his memoir Jackson described the relationship with his father Joe as “turbulent.” He stated he wouldn't know his father Joseph and had never been able “to have a real closeness with him.” He said Joseph found it hard to relate to his children beyond family business. He stated that he and his siblings had been physically abused by his father with a belt or a switch. Jackson said he had fought back and had hidden himself under tables. \nIn his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey Jackson said there had been times when he had been so scared of his father that he would get sick and start to regurgitate when Joe had come to see him. In 2003 his father admitted having whipped Jackson with a switch and a belt. \nIn a speech held at Oxford University in March 2001 Jackson said that his father had never shown him love. He said he had forgiven his father and encouraged parents to spend more time with their children.\nJackson stated that he wouldn't have been so successful if Joseph hadn't been as strong. He said he was thankful that his father hadn't tried to take his children's money.\n\nJackson also said he missed a lot of his childhood. He said it was hard to watch other children playing while he was working. Jackson said that he loved to perform but admitted there had been times when he hadn't wanted to do it. In his mid 30's Jackson said he was compensating for his lost childhood. Later he released a song about it.\n\nChild abuse allegations\nIn November 1993 Jackson's then lawyer Bertram Fields announced that his client would be treated for painkillers outside the U.S. He declined that Jackson wouldn't come back because of the child molestation allegations. He said: \"He's not in a position to cooperate with his attorneys now preparing his defense. He was barely able to function on an intellectual level.\" Fields was criticized by others in Jackson's team for portraying Jackson as incompetent. Later he stated: ”It was important to tell the truth. [The boy’s lawyer] and the press took the position that Michael was trying to hide and that it was all a scam. But it wasn’t“. The lawyer resigned a few days later. The week before Jackson had given two depositions in a copyright issue. One of the plaintiffs‘ lawyers said: ”[Jackson] didn’t look tired at all. It was not obvious to me he was suffering addiction or we wouldn't use the testimony“.\n\nDeath\n\nMedical examination in February 2009\n\nDue to an inquiry about a cancelation insurance for the upcoming tour, insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted. In February 2009, Jackson had an examination performed by David Slavit of New York. Later, the broker told an AEG senior vice president Jackson had only slight hay fever and had passed the exam \"with flying colors\". A second medical exam was supposed to take place on July 6, 2009.\n\nHealth problems in June 2009\nAfter Jackson's death nurse Lee stated that she had received a frantic call on June 21, 2009 from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide had reported that Jackson had been feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She had believed that somebody had given him something that had affected his central nervous system. She had advised the aide to take him to the hospital.\n\nJune 25, 2009\n\nThe autopsy report states that Jackson called his primary physician, cardiologist Conrad Murray, at around 1 am on June 25, 2009, and complained of being dehydrated and being unable to sleep. Murray went to Jackson's residence and administered medical care. The details and extent of the medical care were unknown when the autopsy report was written. Jackson slept for several hours while Murray was at his bedside. He found Jackson not breathing at approximately 12 pm. He pulled him on the bedroom floor and began CPR. 911 was called and paramedics arrived at 12.26 pm. The paramedics continued CPR and ACLS protocol including two rounds of epinephrine and atropine. Jackson was intubated and the CPR efforts continued. Jackson remained unresponsive, his pupils were fixed and dilated. Jackson was transported to UCLA Medical Center under Murray's advisement who gave all medical orders throughout the transport. On arrival Jackson was asystolic. Central lines and an intra-aortic balloon pump were placed but Jackson remained without vital signs. Death was pronounced at 2.26 pm.\n\nDeath investigation\n\nIn the afternoon of June 25, 2009 Jackson's death was reported as an accidental versus natural death case to the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner by the LAPD. The coroner completed a body examination at the hospital in the late afternoon. Later that day the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department-Air Bureau transported Jackson's body to the Coroner's Forensic Science Center.\n\nTwo days after Jackson had died Murray told the police that he had arrived at Jackson's residence at 12:50 a.m. on June 25. He said doses of lorazepam and midazolam hadn't put Jackson to sleep throughout the night so he had given him 25 milligrams of propofol at around 10:40 a.m. He stated that the propofol had been diluted with lidocaine. Murray said he had administered the drug at Jackson's request, after which Jackson fell asleep. Murray stated at some point he had gone to the bathroom, and when he returned he had found Jackson not breathing and had started CPR.\nMurray said he had given Jackson propofol ‘virtually every day‘ for a little more than two months. He said the entertainer had told him the drug would be the only thing that would help him sleep and that he had received it before. Murray stated he had feared Jackson had been becoming addicted. Three days before Jackson's death he had begun to reduce the use of propofol, and with Jackson's reluctant cooperation he had relied more on lorazepam and midazolam. According to Murray, Jackson hadn't needed propofol in the night of June 23, but the next night lorazepam and midazolam hadn't helped Jackson sleep.\n\nOn June 29, the coroner's office issued a subpoena requesting all of Jackson's medical records. Murray only handed over few documents referring to sporadic medical care he had provided since 2006 but no records referring to treatments in Jackson's final months. A few days later the DEA confirmed they had joined the investigations into Jackson's death. A spokesperson said the agency would ”routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance act“.\n\nFollowing Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, said that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases while prescribing medications for Jackson. Police found a CD mentioning the \"Omar Arnold\" alias when they raided the Las Vegas, Nevada home and office of Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician. Use of pseudonyms by celebrities' doctors is common practice for maintaining the confidentiality of patients' medical history.\n\nAutopsy report\n\nJackson's death was caused by an acute propofol intoxication with a benzodiazepine effect being a contributory factor in the death.\nThe coroner determined Jackson's death a homicide based on the following reasons: ”Circumstances indicate that propofol and the benzodiazepines were administered by another. The propofol was administered in a non-hospital setting without any appropriate medical indication. The standard of care for administering propofol was not met […]. Recommended equipment for patient monitoring, precision dosing, and resuscitation was not present. The circumstances do not support self-administration of propofol“.\n\nJackson's autopsy report states one scar beside each of his nostrils, one scar behind each of his ears, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips. It also states a \"dark discoloration resembling a tattoo on the anterior half of the scalp\". Jackson was uncircumcised. The report confirmed that he had vitiligo and states a \"focal depigmentation of the skin\"  (i.e., the depigmentation occurs on one or a few areas of the body). In Jackson's case, there were five affected areas. Two areas of his neck were found to have reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation. He had punctured wounds on his right neck, both arms, both ankles and his right shoulder. Jackson suffered from degenerative osteoarthritis of the lower lumbar spine facet joints and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right index and long fingers as well as the left little finger. He also suffered from a chronic interstitial pneumonitis.\n\nSecond autopsy\nJackson's family sought a second autopsy which was performed by a private pathologist on June 27, 2009. Reverend Jesse Jackson said the family had a lot of questions. Former medical examiners said it is not unusual for families to ask for a second autopsy because they either distrust officials or want a second opinion. A New York pathologist said the family would have the results within one or two weeks. It was estimated that the official results for the toxicology results for Jackson could take four to six weeks.\n\nTrial of Conrad Murray\nIn 2011 Murray was tried for involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors said [Murray]... “repeatedly acted with gross negligence, repeatedly denied appropriate care to his patient.” Records showed that Murray had spent nearly 90 minutes on the phone in the hours before Jackson died making or receiving 11 phone calls.\nMurray's attorneys argued that Jackson administered the fatal dose himself when the defendant wasn't in the bedroom.\nDr Christopher Rogers said in his testimony: “The theory that seems less reasonable to me is that Mr. Jackson woke up, and although he was under the influence of sedative medications, managed to give himself another dose.”\n\nRecords showed that 911 had been called at 12.21 p.m.\nParamedic Richard Sennef testified that Murray didn't mention propofol when he asked him about Jackson's medications. According to Sennef Murray said: “No he’s not taking anything. I just gave him a little bit of Lorazepam to help him sleep.” Murray told Sennef he had treated Jackson for dehydration and exhaustion. Paramedic Martin Blunt testified he saw three open vials of lidocaine on the floor of Jackson's bedroom when he and his colleague arrived. He said when his colleague had asked Murray what drugs Jackson had been given Murray didn't mention lidocaine. Blunt said when they prepared to transport Jackson to the hospital he saw Murray putting three bottles into a black bag.\n\nJackson had arrived at the emergency room of UCLA Medical Center at 1.13 p.m.\nEmergency doctor Richelle Cooper testified she first called death at 12:57 p.m. based on the information provided by the paramedics at Jackson's residence. She said that Jackson had been “clinically dead” when he had arrived Cooper said Murray had told her Jackson had regularly taken valium and flomax and that he had given Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam via IV. That dose had been followed by another dose. After the second dose, Jackson went into arrest.\n\nMurray asked doctors “not to give up easily.” Murray “looked devastated” and “sounded desperate.” Dr Thao Nguyen said she and her attending couldn't find a pulse. Murray said he had detected a pulse and the efforts continued. It was agreed if another attempt and resuscitation efforts with a balloon pump failed, then Jackson would be pronounced dead. After that final procedure, Jackson was pronounced dead. Dr. Nguyen said when she asked Murray if Jackson had taken any other sedatives or narcotics “his reply was negative.” Murray had also been unable to tell Nguyen when Jackson had stopped breathing. Dr Cooper said: “Michael Jackson had died long before he became my patient. It is unlikely with that information [about the propofol] I could have done something that would have changed the outcome.” Murray was sentenced to serve four years in prison.\n\nThe medical examiner, Dr Rogers, testified in court that Jackson had been  and had weighed , which would be within a normal weight range, although he had been thin. He also said that, in his opinion, Jackson “was healthier than the average person of his age” and that the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual.  Toxicologist Dan Anderson testified that Demerol wasn't detected in Jackson's system. However, significant amounts of propofol, lidocaine, and lorazepam were present. According to Nader Kamangar, a sleeping expert at UCLA, drugs such as demerol can cause insomnia. In the case of Jackson, insomnia could have been caused by “anxiety for performing” as well.\n\nDemerol injections\nShortly after Jackson's death speculation about his use of demerol surfaced. Murray's legal team argued that Jackson's insomnia had been caused by demerol and therefore he had needed propofol to get to sleep. Medical records showed that demerol had been administered to Jackson by his dermatologist. An expert for the defense testified that insomnia and anxiety are side effects of demerol withdrawal. According to medical records Klein had given Jackson botox and restylane to treat wrinkles and excessive perspiration. The expert said the demerol shots were ’stiff doses’ that hadn't been needed for skin treatment injections. Records presented by the defense showed that Jackson had visited Klein's clinic at least 24 times between March 12 and June 22, 2009, receiving a total amount of 6,500 mg of demerol during those visits. Murray said he hadn't known about the demerol shots. He said Jackson told him his insomnia was caused by “his creative mind always racing.” The expert testified he believed there was evidence that Jackson had been dependent on demerol, “possibly” addicted. During cross-examination he said he probably wouldn't diagnose Jackson as being addicted to demerol based strictly on the medical records. The witness also said he wasn't a board-certified addiction specialist. Demerol hadn't been found in Jackson's body at the autopsy.\n\nThe theory established by the defense caused a discussion among experts whether propofol should be used to treat withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAftermath\nJackson's death and the trial against Murray started a public discussion about the use and dangers of propofol. Media reports stated that the American Association of Nurse Anesthetics had warned hospitals three days prior to Jackson's death to restrict access to propofol because some medical professionals had become addicted to the drug. Propofol became known as the ’Michael Jackson Drug’ among patients and many of them had reservations about it after Jackson's death. These concerns decreased.\n\t \nFollowing Jackson's death and increasing numbers of fatalities linked to the drug, the DEA stated they would consider labelling propofol a controlled substance. In 2010 the agency recommended adding propofol to the List of Schedule IV drugs but it was not successful. In 2011, North Dakota classified propofol as a controlled substance. North Dakota was joined by Alabama in 2012 and Georgia in 2016. Also in 2011, Korea listed propofol as a psychotropic drug, making its use outside stipulated treatments illegal.\n\t  \t\nIn 2012, Missouri prison officials announced plans to use propofol for death executions. Pharmaceutical companies refused to provide propofol for such purposes.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nBurn survivors\nDrug-related deaths in California\nHealth by individual\nHealth and appearance\nRace and health in the United States\n\n On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died from cardiac arrest and an overdose of propofol. In July 2009, Katherine Jackson and Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's two oldest children, reached a settlement pertaining to the care of Rowe's children, Prince and Paris. The agreement provided that the children would be raised by Katherine and Rowe would have visitation rights and would continue to receive the yearly payments to which Michael had agreed. On August 3, 2009, a judge named Jackson as the children's permanent guardian. As of 2011, Jackson resided at her home in Calabasas, California with her grandson, TJ Jackson, and his family. Jackson moved out of her Hayvenhurst home in Encino, California due to house renovations.

(This was his second marriage, following a brief marriage that was annulled.) Joseph was alleged to have had a lasting extramarital affair. Katherine filed for divorce on March 9, 1973, with a Los Angeles County clerk, but she decided to drop the divorce papers. The following year, Joseph fathered a daughter with Cheryle Terrell who was named JohVonnie. This led Joseph and Cheryle to a 25-year-long affair while raising JohVonnie. Katherine attempted once again to divorce her husband in 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Joseph then moved to Las Vegas, with Katherine remaining at the Jackson family home Hayvenhurst in Encino, California. Despite living separately, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018. Katherine denied rumors that she and Joseph were estranged.\n\n Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. Her divorce had not been made final, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made. It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.\n\nQuestion: What was the name of Michael Jackson's second wife?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?\" René Descartes famously and succinctly proposed: Cogito ergo sum (French: \"Je pense donc je suis\"; English: \"I think, therefore I am\"), not an assessment of humanity, but certainly reflecting a capacity for reasoning as a characteristic of humans, that potentially, could include individual self-reflection.\n\nFrom the hag and hungry goblin || that into rags would rend ye, ; And the spirits that stand || by the naked man || in the Book of Moons, defend ye! To err is human; || to forgive, divine. Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called ballad meter, or the common meter of the hymnodists (see also hymn), is usually thought of as a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of trimeter, but it can also be considered a line of heptameter with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot. Considering the break as a caesura in these verse forms, rather than a beginning of a new line, explains how sometimes multiple caesurae can be found in this verse form (from the ballad, Tom o' Bedlam):  In later and freer verse forms, the caesura is optional. It can, however, be used for rhetorical effect, as in Alexander Pope's line: \n\nIn the medical world, to err is human, to test is divine.Otherwise, body tissue must be broken down to supply vital areas of the body with essential magnesium.6,7\n\nMAGNESIUM TESTING\n\nYou've heard the saying \"To err is human, to forgive is divine\"?PART FOUR\n\n> Testing and Supplements\nCHAPTER 12\n\nMagnesium Requirements, Testing, and Sources\n\nMAGNESIUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for nutrients is set at the minimum level to stave off deficiency symptoms, not at the maximum that ensures good health. But even with the RDA set so low, most Americans are still deficient in magnesium. The following table shows the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for magnesium in children and adults. The RDA for magnesium is also expressed in mg/kg and is roughly 6 mg per kg (2.2 lbs) of body weight. This standard helps to determine the magnesium requirements for someone who is overweight, because a fifty-year-old who weighs 300 pounds needs more magnesium than a fifty-year-old who is 100 pounds. Many magnesium experts feel that the RDA should be increased. Twenty years of research shows that under ideal conditions approximately 300 mg of magnesium is required merely to offset the daily losses.

The permanent registration certificate is one of the four important documents a vehicle plying on the road should always have; the others being a valid insurance certificate, a pollution under control (PUC) certificate and the driver's licence. For public utility vehicles like buses, trucks, taxis and pick-up vans, there are a number of additional documents like a road-worthiness certificate and a transportation permit.\n\n According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or \n\n into the vehicle registration plate. With registration plates in the common EU format, vehicles registered in the EU are no longer required to carry an international code plate or sticker for traveling within the European Economic Area.

EU plates are automatically given to all vehicles unless the owner makes a separate request for old model plates. If desired, EU plates can be changed for old model ones at inspection sites. Registration plates used in Finland are made of aluminium with a reflective membrane coating. Numbers and letters are embossed and painted. The embossing height is 1–1.2 mm. The number sequence of the registration plate cannot start with a zero, nor can zero be the only number. The letter combination CD is reserved for diplomatic vehicles. Usually the next available ID is given as the plate number. Special registration plates with a selected ID are also available upon request. A special registration plate is a regular plate with a special ID. The ID is subject to certain restrictions and requires a separate application subject to a fee. The application fee for a special registration plate is EUR 900. A vehicle has one or two plates depending on the vehicle class. In certain cases, a vehicle can also be given an additional plate.\n\n The minimum age for getting a driver's licence in Iceland is 17 for a B class license, a B class licence will qualify a person to drive low powered motorcycles (50 cc two stroke or equivalent, for more powerful bikes one will have to obtain an A class license), Tractors, ATVs and automobiles that do not exceed a GVWR of 3500 kg or 8 passengers.

Scott and Irwin landed on July 30 near Hadley Rille, and spent just under two days, 19 hours on the surface. In over 18 hours of EVA, they collected about 77 kg of lunar material. Apollo 16 landed in the Descartes Highlands on April 20, 1972. The crew was commanded by John Young, with Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke. Young and Duke spent just under three days on the surface, with a total of over 20 hours EVA. Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program, landing in the Taurus–Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan commanded Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.\n\n Apollo 17 (December 7 – 19, 1972) was the final Moon landing mission of NASA's Apollo program, the most recent time humans have set foot on the Moon or traveled beyond low Earth orbit. Its crew consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, and Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans. Schmitt became the only professional geologist to have landed on the Moon, and the mission's heavy emphasis on science meant the inclusion of a number of new experiments, including a biological experiment containing five mice carried in the command module. Launched at 12:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, Apollo 17 was a \"J-type\" mission that included three days on the lunar \n\n Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 lb of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while \n\n module pilot assignment to Schmitt, a geologist. The mission included the first night launch of a U.S. crewed spacecraft and the final crewed launch of a Saturn V rocket. It was also the final use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose (extra Apollo spacecraft were later used in the Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz programs). The mission broke several crewed spaceflight records, including the longest Moon landing, greatest distance from a spacecraft during an EVA of any type (7.6 kilometers, a record which still stands), longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours 4 minutes), largest lunar sample return (110.52 kilograms or 243.7 lb), longest time in lunar orbit (6 days 4 hours) and most lunar orbits (75).\n\n February 1971 by Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, with Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell. This time the mission was successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface, and completed two EVAs totalling 9hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time. In August 1971, just after conclusion of the Apollo 15 mission, President Richard Nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17.

Heydrich died of his wounds on 4 June 1942. He was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and an important figure in the rise of Adolf Hitler. The assassination, codenamed Operation Anthropoid, was carried out by soldiers of the Czechoslovak Army after preparation and training by the British Special Operations Executive and with the approval of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, led by Edvard Beneš. The Czechoslovaks undertook the operation to help confer legitimacy on the government-in-exile, and to exact retribution for Heydrich's brutal rule. The operation was the only government-sponsored assassination of a senior Nazi leader during the Second World War. Heydrich's death led to a wave of reprisals by SS troops, including the destruction of villages and mass killings of civilians.\n\n Arpad Jakob Valentin Wigand (born 13 January 1906 – 26 July 1983) was a Nazi German war criminal with the rank of SS-Oberführer who served as the SS and Police Leader in Warsaw (SS-und Polizeiführer (SSPF) from 4 August 1941 until 23 April 1943 during the occupation of Poland in World War II. As an aide to Erich von dem Bach Zelewski he first suggested the site of the former Austrian and later Polish artillery barracks in the Zasole suburb of Oswiecim for a concentration camp in January 1940. This site would evolve into the Auschwitz concentration camp which went on to become a major site of the Nazi \"Final Solution to the Jewish question\" resulting in the death of up to 1,000,000 Jews.\n\n  On 20 January 1942, 15 high-ranking Nazi Party and German government officials met at a villa in Wannsee, a Berlin suburb, to coordinate the execution of the \"Final Solution\" (Endlösung) of the Jewish Question. At this Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler's deputy and head of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Main Office, or RSHA), noted the numbers of Jews to be eliminated in each territory. In the notation for France there are two entries, 165,000 for Occupied France, and 700,000 for the Unoccupied Zone, which included France's North African possessions, i.e. Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The SS had established a special unit of 22 people in 1942 \"to Kill Jews in North Africa\". It was led by the SS functionary Walter Rauff, who helped develop the mobile gassing vehicles the Germans used to murder Russian prisoners and Jewish people in Russia and Poland. A network of labor \n\n the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. The Gestapo became Amt IV (Department IV) of RSHA and Müller became the Gestapo Chief, with Heydrich as his immediate superior. After Heydrich's 1942 assassination, Himmler assumed the leadership of the RSHA until January 1943, when Ernst Kaltenbrunner was appointed chief. Müller remained the Gestapo Chief. His direct subordinate Adolf Eichmann headed the Gestapo's Office of Resettlement and then its Office of Jewish Affairs (Referat IV B4 or Sub-Department IV, Section B4). During the Holocaust, Eichmann's department within the Gestapo coordinated the mass deportation of European Jews to the Nazis' extermination camps. The power of the Gestapo included \n\n Ernst Kaltenbrunner (4 October 1903 – 16 October 1946) was a high-ranking Austrian SS official during the Nazi era and a major perpetrator of the Holocaust. He was the subsequent Chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), which included the offices of Gestapo, Kripo and SD, from January 1943 until the end of World War II in Europe. Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party in 1930 and the SS in 1931, and by 1935 he was considered a leader of the Austrian SS. In 1938, he assisted in the Anschluss and was given command of the SS and police force in Austria. In January 1943, Kaltenbrunner was appointed chief of the RSHA, succeeding Reinhard Heydrich, who was assassinated in May 1942. A committed anti-Semite and fanatical Hitler loyalist, Kaltenbrunner oversaw a period in which the genocide of Jews intensified. He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial at the first Nuremberg trials, where he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Kaltenbrunner was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in October 1946.\n\nQuestion: In WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These eventually led to the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in Hawaii where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, Corazon, was installed as his successor. During this 9-year period, curfews were implemented as a safety measure. Majority of radio and television networks were suspended. Journalists who were accused of speaking against the government were taken as political \n\n until 1986. In 1986, Marcos called for an early or \"snap\" election (the next scheduled election was in 1987) and was, including his running mate Arturo Tolentino, declared the winners. The People Power Revolution erupted that drove Marcos out of power, and Corazon Aquino, the runner-up, assumed the presidency. A new constitution was ratified in 1987 that was essentially identical with the provisions of the amended 1973 constitution as long as the election of the president and vice president is concerned, with the presidential election occurring at the second Monday of May and the inauguration every June 30 of the election year. The 1992 election was the first election under \n\n year. This discontent, the resulting resurgence of the opposition in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election, and the discovery of documents exposing his financial accounts and false war records led Marcos to call the snap election of 1986. Allegations of mass cheating, political turmoil, and human rights abuses led to the People Power Revolution of February 1986, which removed him from power. To avoid what could have been a military confrontation in Manila between pro- and anti-Marcos troops, Marcos was advised by US President Ronald Reagan through Senator Paul Laxalt to \"cut and cut cleanly.\" Marcos then fled with his family to Hawaii. He was succeeded as president by Aquino's widow, Corazon \"Cory\" \n\n After Ferdinand Marcos was deposed during the 1986 EDSA Revolution, president Corazon Aquino ordered the release of political prisoners, including Jose Maria Sison and Bernabe Buscayno. Buscayno ceased activities related to the CPP-NPA while Sison eventually went into self-exile in the Netherlands, ostensibly to become chief political consultant to the NDF. Many activists who had joined the underground movement against Marcos chose to resurface. Preliminary peace talks were held between the new administration and the CPP–NPA–NDF, but these ended when the Mendiola massacre took place on January 22, 1987.\n\n At 7:17 pm on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced that he had placed the entirety of the Philippines under martial law, through Presidential Proclamation № 1081, which was dated September 21, 1972. This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one man rule which would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986. Even though the formal proclamation was lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution. When he declared martial law in 1972, Marcos claimed that he had done so in response to the \"communist threat\" posed by the newly founded Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the sectarian \"rebellion\" of the Mindanao Independence Movement (MIM).

One of the highlights for Michigan athletics during the Pattengill's time as chairman of the Athletic Boards came at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, which have sometimes been referred to as the \"Michigan Olympics.\" Five University of Michigan track and field athletes won 9 medals: six gold, two silver, and one bronze. The Michigan medal winners were Archie Hahn (gold medals in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters), Ralph Rose (gold medal in the shot put, silver medal in the discus, and bronze medal in the hammer throw), Charles Dvorak (gold medal in the pole vault), Fred Schule (gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles), and William Coe (silver medal in the shot put).\n\n The United States is the nation that has won the most medals in athletics at the Olympic Games, around 795, of which 332 are gold. Their national-level male, took part in all editions of the games already this season, 25 with the exception of Moscow 1980 known for the 1980 boycott, while women 18 editions from Amsterdam 1928.\n\n Schule competed for the United States as a hurdler at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. He won the gold medal in the 110 meter hurdle event with a time of 16.0 seconds, beating fellow American Thaddeus Shideler by two yards. Schule also competed in the 200 metre hurdles event and finished fifth. The 1904 Summer Olympics have been called the \"Michigan Olympics\" due to the fact that University of Michigan athletes (including Schule, shot putter Ralph Rose, sprinter Archie Hahn, and pole vaulter Charles Dvorak) won ten medals, including six gold medals.\n\nQuestion: In the 1904 Olympics, how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The dam creates Deerfield Reservoir within the Black Hills National Forest. The earthen dam was originally built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1942–1947, with a height of 171 feet, to store irrigation water for the surrounding Pennington County. Construction was started in July 1942 by the Farm Security Administration, and later continued by the Civilian Conservation Corps under the Works Projects Administration during World War II. Employment of conscientious objectors under the Civilian Public Service here drew complaints from locals. The reservoir has a capacity of 15,700 acre-feet and covers 414 acres of surface. Along with providing irrigation and recreation such as ice fishing and ice skating, the reservoir also supplements the municipal water supply of Rapid City, South Dakota and for the nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base. Today, several recreational areas and campgrounds operated by the National Forest Service offer public recreational opportunities to the lake area.\n\n The Great Sioux War refers to a series of conflicts from 1876 to 1877 involving the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne tribes. Following the influx of gold miners to the Black Hills of South Dakota, war broke out when the native followers of Chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse left their reservations, apparently to go on the war path and defend the sacred Black Hills. In the first major fight of the war, on March 17, 1876, about 300 men under Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds attacked 225 Northern Cheyenne and a few Oglala Sioux warriors in the Battle of Powder River \n\n consequent upheaval of the continental crust in the middle Proterozoic eon caused the area around the Great Lakes to become a flattened plain, which in turn led to the creation of the intracontinental basin and the interior and central plains of the United States (the Great Plains are the westernmost portion of North America's Interior Plains, which extend east to the Appalachian Plateau). The Black Hills of South Dakota is one of the few remaining exposed portions of the Trans-Hudson orogenic belt. The peaks of the Black Hills are 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the surrounding plains, while Black Elk Peak - the highest point in South Dakota - has an altitude of \n\n Together with the Hunkpapa and Sihasapa bands, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is part of what was known as the Great Sioux Nation. The peoples were highly decentralized. In 1868 the lands of the Great Sioux Nation were reduced in the Fort Laramie Treaty to the east side of the Missouri River and the state line of South Dakota in the west. The Black Hills, considered by the Sioux to be sacred land, are located in the center of territory awarded to the tribe. In 1874, in direct violation of the treaty, General George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry \n\n The Black Range (also called the Devil's Mountains or Sierra Diablo) is an igneous mountain range running north–south in Sierra and Grant counties in southwest New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Its central ridge forms the western and eastern borders, respectively, of the two counties through much of their contact. The range is about 55 miles (88 km) long from north to south and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. The highest point is McKnight Mountain. The Black Range lies almost entirely within the Gila National Forest. The Mimbres River originates from the mountain snow pack and run-off. The Mimbres Mountains, the southernmost part of the range, are usually included as part of the Black Range.

The 23-minute flight traveled between St. Petersburg, Florida and Tampa, Florida, passing some 50 ft above Tampa Bay in Jannus' Benoist XIV wood and muslin biplane flying boat. His passenger was a former mayor of St. Petersburg, who paid $400 for the privilege of sitting on a wooden bench in the open cockpit. The Airboat line operated for about four months, carrying more than 1,200 passengers who paid $5 each.

The first live flight test of the Martin-Baker system took place on 24 July 1946, when fitter Bernard Lynch ejected from a Gloster Meteor Mk III jet. Shortly afterward, on 17 August 1946, 1st Sgt. Larry Lambert was the first live U.S. ejectee. Lynch demonstrated the ejection seat at the Daily Express Air Pageant in 1948, ejecting from a Meteor. Martin-Baker ejector seats were fitted to prototype and production aircraft from the late 1940s, and the first emergency use of such a seat occurred in 1949 during testing of the jet-powered Armstrong \n\n All Southwest Airlines aircraft are equipped with Wi-Fi, along with free of charge streaming live television, movies, streaming music, and app messaging.

Instead, Nowhere Man portrays Lennon's daily life at the Dakota as that of a \"tormented superstar, a prisoner of his fame, locked in his bedroom raving about Jesus Christ, while a retinue of servants tended to his every need.\" The final part of the book, The Coda, focuses on the mental disintegration of Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, and includes Chapter 27, the so-called missing chapter of J.D. Salinger's classic novel of disaffected youth, The Catcher in the Rye, that \"inspired\" Chapman to murder Lennon. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \"in Lennon's blood.\"\n\n The Dakota was constructed between October 25, 1880, and October 27, 1884. Henry Janeway Hardenbergh's architectural firm was commissioned to create the design for Edward Cabot Clark, head of the Singer Manufacturing Company. The building purportedly was named The Dakota because at the time of its construction, the area was sparsely inhabited and considered remote from the inhabited area of Manhattan, just as the Dakota Territory was considered remote. The earliest appearance of this story, however, was in a 1933 newspaper interview with The Dakota's long-time manager. Christopher Gray of The New York Times quoted the interaction thus: \"Probably it was called 'Dakota' because it was so far west and so far north\". Gray believed that the building's name stemmed from Clark's fondness for the names of the new western states and territories. The Dakota was designated a New York City Landmark in 1969. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976. British musician John Lennon, a building resident, was shot dead by Mark David Chapman outside the building on December 8, 1980. The building's facade was renovated in 2015.\n\n The Dakota, also known as the Dakota Apartments, is a cooperative apartment building on the northwest corner of 72nd Street and Central Park West in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, United States. The Dakota was constructed between 1880 and 1884, and was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. The Dakota has historically been home to many artists, actors, and musicians, including John Lennon, who was murdered in the archway of the building in 1980. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 1969, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\n\n After the death of John Lennon, on December 8, 1980, public awareness of The Hit Factory increased; Lennon's final album had been recorded at The Hit Factory at 353 West 48th Street. Mourners and music fans around the world read accounts of the murder in newspapers on the days following the shooting, and The Hit Factory was mentioned in some of these publications. However, there are contradictory reports as to whether he was recording at The Hit Factory or the nearby Record Plant the day he was murdered. Most publications cite the Record Plant as the location. Witnesses present with John Lennon, such as producer Jack Douglas, cite the Record Plant as the studio where he spent his time recording and mixing tracks the evening of the murder. However, Keith Badman, not an eyewitness, in his book The Beatles: After the Break-up, 1970–2000 states that Lennon had been at The Hit Factory the night of his murder. He also references that Lennon had been at the studio the last several days working on and mixing tracks for Yoko Ono.\n\nJohn Lennon of the Beatles was murdered as he was returning to home to the Dakota, a famed apartment building in New York City. Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had stepped out of a limousine and walked toward the building's entrance when Mark David Chapman shot him four times in the back.  Six hours earlier, Lennon had autographed a copy of his new album, Double Fantasy at Chapman's request.  Chapman remained at the scene and let police take him into custody.  Lennon was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. ; The first U.S. franchise of the Mexican restaurant chain El Pollo Loco opened across the street from MacArthur Park in Los Angeles.

Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set. President Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the Warren Commission—chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination.

Kennedy is a book by attorney Vincent Bugliosi that analyzes the events surrounding the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, focusing on the lives of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. He drew from many sources, including the Warren Report. Bugliosi argues that the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy is correct. The book won the 2008 Edgar Award for the Best Fact Crime category. Bugliosi explored the issues at length; the book is 1,632 pages. It was published with an accompanying CD-ROM containing an additional 1,000+ pages of footnotes. He analyzed both the assassination itself and the rise of the conspiracy theories about the event in the following years. In 2008, Bugliosi published a shorter paperback edition of this book, titled Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It concentrated on the events of the assassination and aftermath. This version was adapted for the movie Parkland (2013).

Such characters were generally referred to as \"mystery men\" in the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books to distinguish them from characters with super-powers. Normally, superheroes use their powers to counter day-to-day crime while also combating threats against humanity by their criminal counterparts, supervillains. Long-running superheroes such as DC's Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman and Marvel's Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man have a \"rogues gallery\" of such enemies. One of these supervillains might be the superhero's archenemy. Superheroes will sometimes combat other threats such as aliens, magical/fantasy entities, natural disasters, political ideologies such as Nazism or communism (and their proponents), and godlike or demonic creatures.\n\n Dr. Thomas Gabriel Wayne, M.D is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is the father of Bruce Wayne (Batman), and husband of Martha Wayne as well as the paternal grandfather of Damian Wayne.

A gifted surgeon and philanthropist to Gotham City, Wayne inherited the Wayne family fortune after Patrick Wayne.

Each twin adapts different characteristics of the Joker. Jerome is a nihilistic anarchist who spreads chaos in Gotham City until his eventual death, while Jeremiah is a cunning narcissist obsessed with tormenting Bruce Wayne. The two have inspired a myriad of other characters in the series, who carry out their ideology as fanatical followers. In the series finale set ten years later, Jeremiah is reinvented as the psychopathic murderer \"J\", serving as a figurative amalgamation of both Valeska twins over the course of the show. It is left up to interpretation whether or not Jeremiah becomes the Joker in the future, in keeping with most iterations of the character in which his origins are ambiguous.\n\nQuestion: Which caped crusader operated in Gotham City?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was tried by a military commission based on the military nature of the conspiracy. Charles Guiteau's trial was held in a civilian court of the District of Columbia where the assassination of James Garfield happened. The assassin of William McKinley, Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed for murder by New York state authorities. The accused assassin of John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, would presumably have been tried for murder by Texas state authorities had he not been killed two days later by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas Municipal Building (then Dallas Police Department headquarters) while being transferred to the county jail. (Ruby himself was initially tried and convicted of murder in a Texas state court, but that was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and he died before he could be retried.) Only after Kennedy's death was it made a federal crime to murder the President of the United States.\n\n Department Headquarters by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, even though it was later overturned on appeal. In 1967, Ruby died in prison while awaiting a new trial. In September 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Kennedy and Tippit were both killed by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone in both murders, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that up to 80% of Americans surveyed have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up to kill President Kennedy. Conspiracy theories have persisted to the present.\n\n to restaurant. When Joe and Sam bought it they called it Campisi's Egyptian Restaurant later they dropped Egyptian from the name. The Campisi family continues to own and manage the restaurant and have opened six additional branches throughout the Dallas area. Campisi's is well known locally for its founder's connections to organized crime, a fact that the restaurant capitalizes on for publicity. Jack Ruby, the killer of Lee Harvey Oswald, was a regular at Campisi's and was frequently seen eating there, including the night before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After Jack Ruby's arrest for killing Oswald, Ruby requested that Joe Campisi visit him in jail. Joe Campisi and his wife visited with Jack Ruby in jail for ten minutes on November 30, 1963.\n\n officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy, and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set. President Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the Warren Commission—chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy. The results of this investigation are disputed by many. The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in \n\n Cry of Battle was the first of two features (along with War Is Hell) playing at the Texas Theatre in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.

After box office cashier Julia Postal was informed by shoe store employee John Brewer that a man had entered the theater, she called Dallas police. Despite attempting to shoot the arresting officer, Oswald was arrested.

The flight was the first Fédération Aéronautique Internationale aviation record to have been won by the Japanese. This flight to Europe made the pilot, Masaaki Iinuma (then 26 years old), a national hero, and he was acclaimed as the “Japanese Lindbergh”. Both the pilot and navigator Kenji Tsukagoshi were awarded the Légion d'honneur by the French government.

The X-3's fastest flight, made on 28 July 1953, reached Mach 1.208 in a 30° dive. A plan to re-engine the X-3 with rocket motors was considered but eventually dropped. With the completion of the contractor test program in December 1953, the X-3 was delivered to the United States Air Force. The poor performance of the X-3 meant only an abbreviated program would be made, to gain experience with low aspect ratio wings.

Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a chase aircraft for \n\n Although assigned to Wright Field, he spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, in California's high desert, testing a wide variety of experimental prototypes such as Douglas' highly unconventional pusher-prop light bomber, the XB-42 Mixmaster. In December 1945, he and Lieutenant Colonel Henry E. Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew this airplane from Long Beach, California, to Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C., in just five hours, 17 minutes. In 1946, he was the principal project pilot for the jet-powered Convair XB-46 prototype bomber. It was also during this period that he acquired his first experience with a flying wing, as he familiarized himself with the flying qualities of the Northrop N-9M, a single-seat, one-third scale mock-up of the giant XB-35 prototype bomber. His superb skills as a pilot, engineer and officer were held in such high esteem that his immediate superior, Major Robert Cardenas, recommended him as project pilot for an unprecedented program—the first attempt to exceed the speed of sound in the Bell X-1. That assignment, however, went to Capt. Chuck Yeager.\n\nThe XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber became the first vehicle to hold a sustained speed (more than half an hour) in excess of Mach 3. Literally moving faster than a speeding bullet, at three times the speed of sound, the six-engine jet aircraft was flown at its \"triplesonic\" speed of more than 2,000 miles per hour for 32 minutes by test pilot Al White of North American Aviation, and his co-pilot, USAF Colonel Joe Cotton.

Anna wanted to give Kate her kidney but Kate, not wanting to live any longer, persuaded Anna to refuse. Sara is forced to acknowledge what Kate has been trying to tell her: she is ready to die. Kate dies in her sleep later that day with her mother by her side.\n\nAfter Kate's death, Campbell reports that Anna has won the case. The family moves on with their lives. Sara, who gave up practicing law to look after Kate, returns to work, Brian retires from firefighting and counsels troubled youths, and Jesse receives an arts scholarship in New York.\n\nAnna reveals that every year on Kate's birthday, they go to Montana, which was her \"most favorite place in the world.\" She concludes that she was not born merely to save her sister, she was born because she had a sister, and that their relationship continues even in death.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nUpon the original creation of the film adaptation, sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning were cast to play Kate and Anna respectively. However, when Dakota heard that she would be required to shave her head for the role, she dropped out of the film as then did Elle. The two sisters were replaced, with Abigail Breslin taking on the lead role as Anna Fitzgerald and Sofia Vassilieva on the role of Kate Fitzgerald.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nMy Sister's Keeper received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of reviews for the film were positive, based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 5.54/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"My Sister's Keeper gets fine performances from its adult and child actors, but the director's heavy-handed approach turns a worthy emotional subject into an overly melodramatic tearjerker.\" Another aggregate review site Metacritic reported 51% positive reviews based on 28 reviews.\n\nBox office\nIn its opening weekend it placed 5th with a total of $12,442,212, behind Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Proposal (second weekend), The Hangover (fourth weekend), and Up (fifth weekend). The film left theatres on October 8, 2009 with a domestic total of $49,200,230 with a further $46,459,927 from foreign markets. It has grossed $95,660,157 worldwide.\n\nAwards\n\nSoundtrack\nTrailer:\n Vega4 – \"Life Is Beautiful\"\nTV spot:\n James Blunt – \"Carry You Home\"\n Plain White T's – \"1, 2, 3, 4\"\n Tyrone Wells – \"More\"\nMovie:\n Don Ho – \"Tiny Bubbles\"\n E.G.

Four young women – Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) – are forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene asylum. The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions at the laundries. Each woman suffers horrific cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior.

Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine. The two sisters become increasingly alienated from their employer, separated by barriers between the classes. The employer and her daughter look down on the sisters for the most trivial things, and it soon becomes the norm for the two pairs of women to not even speak directly to each other. With only each other to turn to, the relationship becomes sexual, adding to the tension between the sisters and their employer. Both of them deal with trauma brought on by strained relationships with their mother and others of the church. Over time, there are continual rumors of the employer’s daughter getting married and moving out. Christine becomes paranoid and jealous that Lea will go with her \n\n The film is based on a book by Nicholas Monsarrat that nearly had Helen Keller's co-workers suing for libel due to perceived parallels between Helen's story and Esther's. In particular, the book seemed to slur the character of Anne Sullivan's husband, writer-publicist John Macy, who was close to Keller's age. A relationship between Macy and Keller has long been a subject of speculation. Esther's reporter friend was reminiscent of Keller's highly publicised attempt to elope with reporter-secretary Peter Fagan. The novel focuses mainly on the falsehoods behind large-scale charities and the self-serving natures of those involved. When Esther recovers her sight and hearing, her promoters worry that this will put an end to the Costello \n\nQuestion: Which orchestral conductor was married to one of the subjects of the film Hillary and Jackie?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the 1935 election, to make up for Mackenzie King's lack of charisma who was additionally a poor speaker and whose views on the issues were inscrutable, Massey sought to portray Mackenzie King as a steady, competent, experienced leader who could best manage the Great Depression. Massy coined the election slogan \"It's either King or Chaos!\", portraying Bennett as an erratic leader whose judgement could not be trusted, unlike Mackenzie King. Massey would had preferred to return to politics-not the least because he thought he would make a better prime minister than Mackenzie King, whose muddled politics he privately held in \n\n David Lloyd Johnston (born June 28, 1941) is a Canadian academic, author, and statesman who served from 2010 to 2017 as Governor General of Canada, the 28th since Canadian Confederation. He is the commissioner of the Leaders' Debates Commission and Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment. Johnston was born and raised in Ontario, studying there before enrolling at Harvard University and later Cambridge and Queen's universities. He went on to work as a professor at various post-secondary institutions in Canada, eventually serving administrative roles as dean of law at the University of Western Ontario, principal of McGill University, and president of the University of Waterloo. At the same time, Johnston involved himself with politics and public service, moderating political debates and chairing commissions in both the federal and provincial spheres, his most renowned position in that field being the chairmanship of the inquiry into the Airbus affair. He was in 2010 appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of then Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, to replace Michaëlle Jean as viceroy and he occupied the post until succeeded by Julie Payette in 2017.\n\n James Harold King (October 17, 1871 &ndash; May 10, 1949) was a doctor and politician in Ontario, Canada. He represented Wellington South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1934 to 1943 as a Liberal. The son of James King and Agnes Munn, both natives of Scotland, he was born in Hastings County and was educated in Chatham, in London, at Trinity University and at the University of Western Ontario. In 1909, he married Mary Nicoll. He served as medical officer of health for Guelph and Puslinch townships. King was first elected to the Ontario assembly in a 1934 by-election held following the death of Duncan Paul Munro. He was reelected in 1937.\n\n Victor Christian William Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire (31 May 1868 – 6 May 1938), known as Victor Cavendish until 1908, was a British peer and politician who served as Governor General of Canada. A member of the Cavendish family, he was educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge. After the death of his father in 1891, he entered politics, winning his father's constituency unopposed. He held that seat until he inherited his uncle's dukedom in 1908. Thereafter, he took his place in the House of Lords, while, for a period at the same time, acting as mayor of Eastbourne and Chesterfield. He held various government posts both prior to and after his rise to \n\n On February 1, 1952, the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada announced that George VI had approved Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's choice of Massey to succeed the Viscount Alexander of Tunis as the King's representative. Five days later, however, the King was dead and Massey, upon his swearing-in, became the first Canadian-born representative of George's daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. In the bustle over the king's death, there was little fanfare around Massey's appointment; Lord Alexander quietly departed Canada shortly after the announcement of Massey as his successor, leaving Chief Justice Thibaudeau Rinfret as administrator of the government in his place, as Massey was, at the time, in London.

In a 1999 The Phantom story, Lord of the Jungle, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. Warren Ellis' Planetary series has a pastiche of Tarzan named Lord Blackstock. In 1999, Dark Horse Comics published comics featuring the Disney version of the character from the 1999 film. In 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc began publishing webcomics on their official website including Tarzan by writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Grindberg and Tarzan of The Apes by Roy Thomas, artist Pablo Marcos, and colorist/letterer Oscar Gonzales. In October 2016, the Tarzan has to be drawn by Benito Gallego.\n\n Tarzan the Ape Man is a 1932 pre-Code American action adventure film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer featuring Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous jungle hero Tarzan and starring Johnny Weissmuller, Neil Hamilton, C. Aubrey Smith and Maureen O'Sullivan. It was Weissmuller's first of 12 Tarzan films. O'Sullivan played Jane in six features between 1932 and 1942. The film is loosely based on Burroughs' 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes, with the dialogue written by Ivor Novello. The film was directed by W. S. Van Dyke. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released two remakes of Tarzan, the Ape Man in 1959 and in 1981, but each was a different adaptation of Rice Burroughs' novel. It is also the first appearance of Tarzan’s famous yell.\n\n Tarzan: The Lost Adventure is a novel credited to Edgar Rice Burroughs and American writer Joe R. Lansdale, based on an incomplete fragment of a Tarzan novel, written by Burroughs, which had been left unfinished at his death. The book was serialized in four parts by Dark Horse Comics, before being published as a single volume in 1995.\n\n Tarzan, a fictional character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first appeared in the 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes, and then in twenty-four sequels by Burroughs and numerous more by other authors. The character proved immensely popular and quickly made the jump to other media, first and most notably to comics and film. This article concerns Tarzan's appearance in film and other non-print media.\n\n Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins is a collection of two Tarzan novellas by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, for younger readers. It was originally published as two children's books, The Tarzan Twins by Voland in October 1927, and Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, by Whitman in March 1936. These were brought together in November 1963 under the title of Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins in the first complete edition. Despite the gap in when they were written and first published, the events of the two stories occur in the same time-frame. The opening passage of \"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion\" specifies that its events occur immediately after those of \"The Tarzan Twins.\" In \n\nQuestion: In what year was the first Tarzan novel published?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Perhaps the earliest uses in print occurred in two articles in the Boston Globe in August 1973 about proposed ambulance regulations in Massachusetts. “…any police or fireman who staff a ‘dual-purpose’ vehicle would have to be trained to offer ‘first-responder’ care — that is, to stabilize a patient until more sophisticated help arrived.”\n\n“The chances are even better that your emergency call will be answered by a police or fire vehicle doing double duty instead of an adequately equipped ambulance and a paramedic trained in ‘first responder’ care.”(There were some earlier uses of “first response”, though not “first responder”, in this sense. They included an article in The Daly Sentinel (Grand Junction, CO) in March 1972, and another about the formation of a First Response Group composed of volunteers in the Burlington (VT) Free Press in April 1973.)\n\nA few months after its use in the Globe, the term “first-responders\" appeared in a Boston Herald article about a master plan for emergency care from the Health Planning Council of Greater Boston.

They decided that it was time to create a private ambulance company and took their idea to the Lafayette Police Jury. Without the needed funds to get started, they decided to hire former Vietnam War medics to staff their new company, and raise funds through membership subscriptions. On July 21, 1971, the Police Jury authorized Acadian Ambulance Service, Inc. to be the emergency provider for Lafayette Parish. To this day, Acadian uses membership drives to aid funding of the company. When Acadian first started, they had just 2 ambulances and 8 medics. Roland Dugas was the first president.

The Anglo-American Ambulance has been described as a key means of exchanging medical best practice between the volunteers and the French and Prussian surgeons they worked with. In addition to spreading the word of Lister's pioneering work on antiseptics and widening the use of chloroform and morphine on the battlefield the ambulance helped to popularise a standardised method of treating bullet wounds which was based on Surgeon-General Sir Thomas Longmore's 1863 work with Minié rifle bullet wounds. MacCormac claimed that the adoption of this method was the primary reason for the low mortality rates achieved by the ambulance.\n\nQuestion: In which country were motorized ambulances first used?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The price was $600. Starting in 1924, the truck was available with a factory-produced body. By 1926 the price had dropped to $325. In 1925, a hand-operated windshield wiper was added.\n\n In his World Encyclopedia of Military Vehicles, author Pat Ware writes that: \"During World War I, the Model T was .. standardized in the \"light\" class. The first truck, using a long-wheelbase chassis designated Model TT, was launched in 1917. Although Ford .. was a pacifist, he was .. happy to supply the US Army with more than 12,000 of these vehicles,..\" and: \"There was no civilian production of the Model Ts between 1917 and 1918.\" Further on, Ware writes: \"The Model T was widely used by the US and British armies during World War I as a staff car, ambulance, van and cargo truck, even as an artillery tractor, for which application the truck was fitted with twinned rear tyres.\" Many remained in service into the 1930s.

Built in 1904, it was the second center of automobile production for the Ford Motor Company, after the Ford Mack Avenue Plant. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, the company created and first produced the Ford Model T, the car credited with initiating the mass use of automobiles in the United States. Prior to the Model T, several other car models were assembled at the factory. Early experiments using a moving assembly line to make cars were also conducted there. It was also the first factory where more than 100 cars were assembled in one day. While it was headquartered at the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford Motor Company became the biggest U.S.-based automaker, and it would \n\n an assembly plant was constructed in a rented warehouse in the Westhafen (western port) district of Berlin, which was well located for receiving deliveries of kits and components via the country's canal network.

The mainline was built between 1895 and 1905 as part of the Trans-Siberian Railway. It bordered the Circum-Baikal Railway on the west and the Chinese Eastern Railway on the east. The railway bore the name of Vyacheslav Molotov between 1936 and 1943. The Amur Railway became part of the network in 1959. As of 2009, the railway employs 46 741 people; its route length totals 3336,1 km.\n\n The railway is often associated with the main transcontinental Russian line that connects hundreds of large and small cities of the European and Asian parts of Russia. At a Moscow–Vladivostok track length of 9,289 km, it spans a record eight time zones. Taking eight days to complete the journey, it is the third-longest single continuous service in the world, after the Moscow–Pyongyang 10267 km and the Kyiv–Vladivostok 11085 km services, both of which also follow the Trans-Siberian for much of their routes. The main route of the Trans-Siberian Railway begins in Moscow at Yaroslavsky Vokzal, runs through Yaroslavl or Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude, Chita, and Khabarovsk to Vladivostok via southern Siberia. A second primary \n\n The line is single-track, excepting the double-track section from Tynda to Bestuzhevo, which shared with the Baikal–Amur Mainline (BAM). The full length of the line is not electrified. As in most of Siberia, construction and operation of the railway is complicated by the large temperature variations, ranging from under -50 °C in winter to over 30 °C in summer, as well as the challenges of building on permafrost in difficult terrain. The line currently has an official length of 1,213 km, branching from the Trans-Siberian railway at Bamovskaya station, near Skovorodino in Amur Oblast. The line continues north, joining the Baikal–Amur Mainline near Tynda and continuing along the BAM for 27 \n\n The Trans–Siberian Railway (TSR; ) is a network of railways connecting Western Russia to the Russian Far East. It is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over 9,289 km, from the capital Moscow, the largest city in Europe, to Vladivostok, which is next to the Sea of Japan. Russian Empire government ministers personally appointed by the Emperor Alexander III of Russia and by his son, the Tsarevich Nicholas (later Emperor Nicholas II from 1894), supervised the building of the railway between 1891 and 1916. Even before its completion, the line attracted travelers who wrote of their adventures. The Trans-Siberian Railway has directly connected Moscow with Vladivostok since 1916. Expansion of the railway system continues, with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea. There are also plans to connect Tokyo, the capital of Japan, to the railway via bridges between the mainland and the islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaido.\n\n The Trans-Siberian Railway, completed in 1905, was the first network of railways connecting Europe and Asia. It connects Western Russia to the Russian Far East, and is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over 9,289 km. The railway starts from Russia's capital Moscow, which is the largest city in Europe, and ends at Vladivostok, situated on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Expansion of the railway system continues, with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea. There are also plans to connect Tokyo, the capital of Japan, to the railway.

The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders. The African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State \n\nAt the base eight-pointed star, in the upper part of both the white and the green field are set two eight-pointed stars. ; At the centre of the shield is a horseman, flying on the fabulous steed called Arash, and shooting an arrow towards the stars. This scene is from the heroic epic Narts. The Emblem of the Republic of Abkhazia was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia on 23 July 1992, after it declared its secession from Georgia. The emblem of separatist Republic of Abkhazia is a shield divided vertically into white and green. On this are placed devices outlined in gold: Green symbolizes youth and life, while white symbolizes spirituality. The stars represent the sun, as well as the union of the East and West.\n\n The national flag of the Philippines is a horizontal bicolor flag with equal bands of royal blue and crimson red, with a white, equilateral triangle at the hoist. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each representing a province. At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed, golden-yellow star, each of which representing one of the country's three main island groups—Luzon, the Visayas (though originally referring to the island of Panay) and Mindanao. The white triangle at the flag represents liberty, equality, and fraternity. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.\n\n a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of the \"national colours\" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many African nations. Together the colours green, gold, and red constitute the Pan-African colours. The African Union has adopted the anthem \"Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together\".\n\n The RMS flag is vertical blue, white, green, red (1:1:1:6) and has proportions 2:3. It was first hoisted 2 May 1950 at 10.00 AM. Two days later the government gave the explanation of the flag.

The Maldives first established a mission in Sri Lanka in July 1965, and today has a High Commission in Colombo. Sri Lanka has a high commission in Malé. Both countries were founding members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in December 1985. On 13 February 2014 Zahiya Zareer was appointed by President Abdulla Yameen as High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. The Maldives has an embassy in Bangkok and Thailand is accredited to the Maldives via its embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka\n\n The Maldives has, in recent years, become one of the epicenters of the climate refugee debate. The Maldives has an average estimated elevation of 1.5 meters above sea-level, with 80 percent of its islands currently resting less than 1 meter above sea-level. The total landmass of the islands is continuously decreasing due to rising sea-levels, and many of the smaller islands are thought to be years away from becoming completely submerged. Climate change has recently become a long-term security issue for the Maldives which, according to numerous climate scientists, could disappear entirely within one or two centuries. Rising ocean temperatures are also a major environmental challenge \n\n The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which occurred on December 26 that year, caused great damage in both Maldives and Sri Lanka, as well as other Indian Ocean nations. In response, with assistance from the United States, the US$16.6 million Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS) was established in 2005 to set up monitoring systems and share information between the nations at risk. Global warming is a severe threat to the Maldives, with most of the islands less than 1.5 m above sea level. The then President, Mohamed Nasheed had said he planned to set aside some of the US$1 billion a year it receives from tourism to buy a new homeland. He had approached the government of Sri Lanka, among others, and was said to have received a favourable reception.\n\n Maldives is located south of India's Lakshadweep Islands in the Indian Ocean. Both nations established diplomatic relations after the independence of Maldives from British rule in 1966. India was one of the first nations to recognise Maldives' independence. Since then, India and Maldives have developed close strategic, military, economic and cultural relations. India has supported Maldives' policy of keeping regional issues and struggles away from itself, and the latter has seen friendship with India as a source of aid as well as a counterbalance to Sri Lanka, which is in proximity to the island nation and its largest trading partner.\n\n The ecoregion is made up of low islands made mostly of coral sand, generally no more that 5 meters above sea level, and surrounded by extensive coral reefs. The islands rest on the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, an oceanic ridge and plateau, and extend 2,550 km north and south across the equator, from latitude 14º N to 8º S. Lakshadweep lies to the north, 300 km west of India's southwest coast. Lakshadweep consists of 36 small islands between 8º - 14º N, with a total land area of 32 km2. The Maldives are the largest island group, with approximately 1190 islands between 7º N and the equator.

By mid-century, caravans were no longer bringing silk from Iran to Aleppo, and local Syrian production was insufficient for Europe's demand. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo's decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo.\n\n In 2011, Aleppo was Syria's largest city, with a population of 2.5 million people. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has been described by Time as Syria's commercial capital.

This convocation was one of the events that transformed the general economic and political malaise of the country into the French Revolution. In June 1789, the Third Estate unilaterally declared itself the National Assembly. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution. Within three short months, the majority of the king's executive authority had been transferred to the elected representatives of the Nation.\n\n Louis XVII (born Louis Charles, Duke of Normandy; 27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795) was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the new Dauphin (heir apparent to the throne), a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the title of Prince Royal. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as the king of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic and since Louis-Charles died in June 1795, he never actually ruled. Nevertheless, in 1814 after the Bourbon Restoration, his uncle acceded to the throne and was proclaimed Louis XVIII.\n\n In the spring of 1789, France is devastated by famine. The French people begin to rise in unrest against the ruling French king Louis XVI. Ronan, a young peasant, leads a revolt marching to Paris after his father's death (killed by Count Lazare de Peyrolles), where he encounters Olympe, an assistant governess of the children of Marie Antoinette of Austria. The two fall in love during the tumultuous stirrings of the French Revolution, their romance playing out amid encounters with major Revolutionary figures such as Georges Jacques Danton, Maximilien de Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins. After they are separated, Ronan and Olympe find each other again on 14 July 1789 in the course of the assault on the Bastille prison— an encounter that seals their destiny even as a new era begins.\n\n During the French Revolution the National Convention became the executive power of France, following the execution of King Louis XVI. With powerful members, such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton, the Jacobin Club, a French political party established in 1790, at the birth of the revolution, managed to secure control of the government and pursue the revolution to their own ends, culminating in a \"Reign of Terror\". Its repressive policies resulted in insurrection across much of France, including the three largest cities after Paris, namely Lyon, Marseille and Toulon, in the south of France. Citizens in the south were opposed to a centralised government, and to the decrees of its rule, which resulted in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.\n\n From 1789 to early 1792, the French Revolution gradually radicalised, breaking with old institutions and practices as it went, and targeting defenders of the Ancien Régime. Some of these defenders, or people who were unintentionally caught in the crossfire, emigrated from France to avoid persecution. King Louis XVI himself attempted to escape with his family to Varennes in June 1791, but he was caught. The French king was put under surveillance, and increasingly suspected of conspiring with other European monarchs, who wished to preserve the House of Bourbon in France and restore its pre-revolutionary authority. This was explicitly stated in the Declaration of Pillnitz (17 August 1791) by king Frederick William II of Prussia and emperor Francis II (Austria, Hungary and Bohemia), who called on all monarchs in Europe to 'liberate' \n\nQuestion: Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The c. 220,000 strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is known officially as Bulgarian Muslims. The term has also been used as a wider designation, including also the Slavic Muslim populations of North Macedonia and Albania. They speak various Bulgarian dialects and those spoken in Greece and Turkey are referred to there as the Pomak language. The community in Greece is commonly fluent in Greek, and in Turkey, Turkish, while the communities in these two countries, especially in Turkey, are increasingly adopting Turkish as their first language as a result of education and family links with the Turkish people. They are not officially recognized as one people with the ethnonym of Pomaks. The term is widely used colloquially for Eastern South Slavic Muslims, considered derogatory. However, in Greece and Turkey the practice for declaring the ethnic group at census has been abolished for decades. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak,   ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other.\n\n In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007. However, in digital communication using computers and writing emails and SMS, the Latin script has been proposed to replace the Cyrillic. A Bulgarian Latin alphabet, the so-called shlyokavitsa, is already often employed for convenience for emails and SMS messages. Ciphers are used to denote Bulgarian sounds that cannot be represented with a single Latin character (for example, a \"4\" represents a \"ч\" because they look alike and the Bulgarian word for the cardinal number four, чѐтири čѐtiri, starts with a \"ч\").\n\n Bulgarians are the main ethnic group in Bulgaria, according to the census of the population in 2011 they are 6,000,000 people, or 86% of the country's population.\n\n Bulgarian (, ; български, ) is a South Slavic language spoken in Southeastern Europe, primarily in Bulgaria. It is the language of the Bulgarians. Along with the closely related Macedonian language (collectively forming the East South Slavic languages), it is a member of the Balkan sprachbund and South Slavic dialect continuum of the Indo-European language family. The two languages have several characteristics that set them apart from all other Slavic languages; changes include the elimination of case declension, the development of a suffixed definite article and the lack of a verb infinitive. They retain and have further developed the Proto-Slavic verb system (albeit analytically). One such major development is the innovation of evidential verb forms to encode for the source of information: witnessed, inferred, or reported. It is the official language of Bulgaria, and since 2007 has been among the official languages of the European Union. It is also spoken by minorities in several other countries.\n\nQuestion: What is the principal language of Bulgaria?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was constructed entirely from red brick, and was not rendered externally. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Typically for old-style church buildings, each side aisle is strengthened by five buttresses, the ten together symbolising the Ten Commandments. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n Church of the Assumption is a Russian Orthodox church in the village of Nedvigovka, Rostov Oblast, Russia. It belongs to the Diocese of Rostov and Novocherkassk. Erected in the early 20th century, it is considered to be an object of Russian cultural heritage.\n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks and Russia eventually became part of the Soviet Union in 1922. Because the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the government ordered many churches closed; the cathedral was closed in 1938. During World War II, it was threatened with demolition, and was used after the war for civil purposes, as a warehouse and then a hostel.

Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of three Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Groundbreaking was in 1899; construction work began in 1901 and was completed ten years later. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki.

As a direct result of the battle, Islamic forces once again became the dominant power in the region, re-conquering Jerusalem and several other Crusader-held cities. In 1189, the first lodge for Sufi ascetics was established at the Al-Khanqah al-Salahiyya Mosque in Jerusalem, which had been a palace of the Latin Patriarch prior to the reconquest of the city. The Christian defeat led to a Third Crusade aimed to regain the lost territories in the Holy Land. Richard I of England (Richard \n\n The Crusade of 1101 was a minor crusade of three separate movements, organized in 1100 and 1101 in the successful aftermath of the First Crusade. It is also called the Crusade of the Faint-Hearted due to the number of participants who joined this crusade after having turned back from the First Crusade. Calls for reinforcements from the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II, successor to Pope Urban II (who died before learning of the outcome of the crusade that he had called), urged a new expedition. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home.\n\n The siege of Jerusalem lasted from September 20 to October 2, 1187, when Balian of Ibelin surrendered the city to Saladin. Earlier that summer, Saladin had defeated the kingdom's army and conquered several cities. The city was full of refugees and had few defenders, and it fell to the besieging armies. Balian bargained with Saladin to buy safe passage for many, and the city came into Saladin's hands with limited bloodshed. Though Jerusalem fell, it was not the end of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as the capital shifted first to Tyre and later to Acre after the Third Crusade. Latin Christians responded in 1189 by launching the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus, and Frederick Barbarossa separately. In Jerusalem, Saladin restored Muslim holy sites and generally showed tolerance towards Christians; he allowed Orthodox and Eastern Christian pilgrims to visit the holy sites freely -- though Frankish (i.e. Catholic) pilgrims were required to pay a fee for entry. The control of Christian affairs in the city was handed over to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.\n\n possessions.

The Council of State is a constitutionally established advisory body to the government, which consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic, or military experience. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court of the Netherlands, Curacao, Sint Maarten and Aruba. The Court sits in The Hague, Netherlands and presides over civil, criminal and tax-related cases.\n\n chairs meetings in the King's absence. Under Dutch Constitutional Law the Vice-Chairman of the Council is acting Head of State when there is no Monarch; e.g. if the Royal Family were to become extinct. For criminal law, the independent Hoge Raad is the highest court of the Netherlands, as well as Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. The Court was established on 1 October 1838 and sits in The Hague, Netherlands. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited primarily to civil, criminal and tax-related cases. The Court has the authority to overturn rulings by appellate courts (cassation) and therefore establishes case law, but only if the lower court applied the law incorrectly or the ruling lacks sufficient reasoning; facts are no longer subject of discussion. The Court may not rule on the constitutionality of laws passed by the States-General and treaties. Hence the Netherlands has no constitutional court.\n\n was both accepted and criticised at the same time. The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, NATO, OECD and WTO. Together with Belgium and Luxembourg it forms the Benelux economic union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust.

This battle was fought between the Norman-French Army under William the Conqueror and the English army under Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. This pitched battle was fought as William engaged Godwinson who deployed his army of infantry in a small dense formation at the top of a steep slope. The English formation held heavy infantry, referred to as housecarls, at the centre and light infantry on the flanks. Across the front of Godwinson's battle line was a shield wall made from soldiers interlocking their shields holding spears and missile troops behind. The Normans under William deployed in three groups which consisted of their origins, Bretons \n\nRoger of Montgomery - the combined Rapes of Chichester and Arundel. ; William de Braose - Rape of Bramber. ; William de Warenne - Rape of Lewes ; Robert, Count of Mortain - Rape of Pevensey ; Robert, Count of Eu - Rape of Hastings See also Norman conquest of England and English feudal barony On Friday, 13 October 1066, Harold Godwinson and his English army arrived at Senlac Hill just outside Hastings, to face William of Normandy and his invading army. On 14 October 1066, during the ensuing battle, Harold was killed and the English defeated. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex \n\n The Anglo-Normans (, Engel-Norðmandisca) were the medieval ruling class in England, composed mainly of a combination of ethnic Normans, French, Anglo-Saxons, Flemings and Bretons, following the Norman conquest. A small number of Normans had earlier befriended future Anglo-Saxon king of England, Edward the Confessor, during his exile in his mother's homeland of Normandy in northern France. When he returned to England some of them went with him, and so there were Normans already settled in England prior to the conquest. Edward's successor, Harold Godwinson, was defeated by Duke William the Conqueror of Normandy at the Battle of Hastings, leading to William's accession to the English throne. The victorious \n\n  King Harold accepted a truce with the surviving Norwegians, including Harald's son Olaf and Paul Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney. They were allowed to leave after giving pledges not to attack England again. The losses the Norwegians had suffered were so severe that only 24 ships from the fleet of over 300 were needed to carry the survivors away. They withdrew to Orkney, where they spent the winter, and in the spring Olaf returned to Norway. The kingdom was then divided and shared between him and his brother Magnus, whom Harald had left behind to govern in his absence. Harold's victory was short-lived. Three days after the battle, on 28 September, a second invasion army led by William, Duke of Normandy, landed in Pevensey Bay, Sussex, on the south coast of England. Harold had to immediately turn his troops around and force-march them southwards to intercept the Norman army. Less than three weeks after Stamford Bridge, on 14 October 1066, the English army was decisively defeated and King Harold II fell in action at the Battle of Hastings, beginning the Norman conquest of England, a process facilitated by the heavy losses amongst the English military commanders.\n\n Harold would have been celebrating his victory at Stamford Bridge on the night of 26/27 September 1066, while William of Normandy's invasion fleet set sail for England on the morning of 27 September 1066. Harold marched his army back down to the south coast, where he met William's army, at a place now called Battle just outside Hastings. Harold was killed when he fought and lost the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. The Battle of Hastings virtually destroyed the Godwin dynasty. Harold and his brothers Gyrth and Leofwine were dead on the battlefield, as was their uncle Ælfwig, Abbot of Newminster. \n\nQuestion: In which battle did Harold II, the last Saxon king, lose his life?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Party, still led by urban intellectuals, developed a radical agenda of mass mobilization, labor organization, rural uprisings, anti-imperialism, and national unification. As the Northern Expedition neared success, Chiang in December 1927 unleashed a White Terror that virtually wiped out the Party in the cities. Mao Zedong, whose Autumn Harvest Uprising had been a spectacular failure in mobilizing local peasants, never-the-less became Party leader and established rural bases and creation of the Chinese Red Army to protect them. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) Mao led a rectification campaign to emphasize Maoism and his leadership and after the war he led the Party to victory in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949). In the years after 1949, the structure of the Party remained basically the same, but the style of leadership changed several times.\n\n In 1921 the Soviet Union began supporting the Kuomintang (KMT), and in 1923 the Comintern instructed the Chinese Communist Party (commonly abbreviated as CCP) to sign a military treaty with the KMT. On May 31, 1924, the two governments signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations, while the Soviet government renounced in that agreement all privileges granted to the Tsarist government in China. But in 1926 KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, after the conclusion of the Northern Expedition, Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the Chinese Civil War which would last until 1949, a few months after the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, led by Mao Zedong. During the war the Soviets gave some support to the CCP, which in 1934 suffered a crushing blow when the KMT brought an end to the Chinese Soviet Republic, thus causing the CCP's Long March from Shaanxi. The Soviet Union tried and failed in an attempt to make the Hui hostile to China.\n\n discussion for the entire martial law era. From the 1930s onward the Chinese Civil War was underway in mainland China between Chiang Kai-shek's ROC government and the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong. When the Communists gained complete control of Mainland China in 1949, two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, fled to Taiwan. On October 1, 1949 the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) was founded in mainland China by the victorious communists; several months before, Chiang Kai-shek had established a provisional ROC capital in Taipei and moved his Nanjing-based government there. Under Nationalist rule, the mainlanders dominated the government and civil services.\n\n After the conclusion of World War II, the civil war resumed between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Despite initial gains by the KMT, they were eventually defeated and forced to flee to off-shore islands, most notably Taiwan. In the war, the United States supported the Kuomintang and the Soviet Union supported the CCP, but both to limited extent. With the Kuomintang's defeat & retreat to Taiwan, Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\n\n On 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the PRC before a massive crowd at Tiananmen Square. The CCP headed the Central People's Government. From this time through the 1980s, top leaders of the CCP (like Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping) were largely the same military leaders prior to the PRC's founding. As a result, informal personal ties between political and military leaders dominated civil-military relations.  Stalin proposed a one-party constitution when Liu Shaoqi visited the Soviet Union in 1952. Then the Constitution of the PRC in 1954 changed the previous coalition government \n\nQuestion: Who proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Parr's mother had expended great sums to arrange the marriage, as she noted in her will. In 1542 she eloped from him, stating that \"she would live as she lusted\". On 17 April 1543 their marriage was annulled by an Act of Parliament and any of her children \"born during esposels between Lord and Lady Parr\" were declared bastards. Parr also obtained his ex-wife's lands and was himself created Earl of Essex on 23 December 1543. She predeceased Parr by only 9 months, having been awarded after her divorce a few of her father's former estates by Queen Mary. ; Secondly, in 1548, he married Elisabeth \n\n plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was told of the marriage, she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, died at the age of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester.

Thomas Parr married Maud Green (6 April 1492 – 1 December 1531), daughter of Sir Thomas Green and \n\n Soon after her return, Mary was married to William Carey, a wealthy and influential courtier, on 4 February 1520; Henry VIII was a guest at the couple's wedding. At some point, Mary became Henry's mistress; the starting date and duration of the liaison are unknown. It was rumoured that one or both of Mary's children were fathered by the King. Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, had first been married to Henry's elder brother Arthur when he was a little over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died just a few months later. Henry later used this to justify the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.\n\n Katherine Brandon (née Willoughby), Duchess of Suffolk, suo jure 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby (22 March 1519 – 19 September 1580), was an English noblewoman living at the courts of King Henry VIII, King Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I. She was the fourth wife of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who acted as her legal guardian during his third marriage to Henry VIII's sister Mary. Her second husband was Richard Bertie, a member of her household. Following Charles Brandon's death in 1545, it was rumoured that King Henry had considered marrying Katherine as his seventh wife, while he was still married to his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, who was Katherine's close friend. An outspoken supporter of the English Reformation, she fled abroad to Wesel and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the reign of Queen Mary I, to avoid persecution.\n\nQuestion: Which wife of Henry VIII had already married twice before she became queen, and married for a fourth time after Henry's death?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He finished his works until 1520. He used the same system when he designed the fortification of one of the largest castles in Bohemia called Rabí. After the war, Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III. ordered the demolition of the castle, possibly out of fear for it being an \"unconquerable fort of anti-Habsburg resistance\". Luckily, thanks to constant postponing of the demolition, only a part of rampart was damaged. Castle palaces, chapel and other parts of the bastion were used as a granary, devaluating the whole complex, yet protecting it from being rebuilt. The castle stayed in Czernin's hands until the nationalization in 1945.\n\n Laxenburg castles are imperial palaces and castles outside Vienna, in the town of Laxenburg owned in equal parts by Vienna and Lower Austria. The castles became a Habsburg possession in 1333 and formerly served as a summer retreat, along with Schönbrunn palace, for the imperial Habsburg dynasty. Blauer Hof Palace was the birthplace of some members of the royal family, including Crown Prince Rudolf. Another castle nearby is named Franzensburg castle. Today the castles are used for events, conferences, and concerts. The castles also acts as a museum in preserving the various paintings and furnishings contained within.\n\n of the House of Habsburg until 1415, when Duke Frederick IV of Austria lost the canton of Aargau to the Swiss Confederacy. The original coat of arms to fly over Habsburg Castle, a red lion on a golden field, remained part of the Austrian arms up to the end of the imperial period. The modern arms of the municipality of Habsburg, Switzerland, depict Habsburg Castle. The area around the castle was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed. Today the \"large\" and \"small\" towers of the original castle are preserved, attached to a residential building of the 13th century, while large parts of the complex lie in ruins. The extent of its eastern part is recognizable only by foundation walls. The palatial residence hosts a restaurant and a small exhibition.\n\n The castle was built around 1020 by Count Radbot, of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and Werner, Bishop of Strasbourg. They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. It is believed that he named the castle after a hawk (Habicht) seen sitting on its walls. Some historians and linguists believe the name may come from the Middle High German word hab/hap meaning ford, as it is located near a ford of the Aar River. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276.

At the time of its construction, the location was part of the Duchy of Swabia. Habsburg Castle is the original seat of the House of Habsburg, which became one of the leading imperial and royal dynasties in Europe. It is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance.\n\nQuestion: In which country is the castle that gives the Habsburg dynasty its name?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There Ramming's VI Corps was relieved by Archduke Leopold's VIII Corps. Benedek, having reached the field and scouted the terrain, decided by 11:00 am to abandon any thought of counterattacking the Prussians with the combined VI, VIII and IV Corps, resumed his march towards Jičín, and ordered the VIII Corps to abandon Skalice if by 2:00 pm no serious battle had started. After transmitting these orders Benedek departed towards his main army. Merely 15 minutes after Benedek left, the battle erupted. While the Austrians prevaricated, Steinmetz decided at 8:30 am to send eight infantry \n\n In 1809, Europe was embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against a series of coalitions in the Coalition Wars almost continuously since 1792. A brief period of peace followed the March 1802 Treaty of Amiens before British-French relations deteriorated, leading to the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803. Britain was joined in their coalition by Sweden in 1804 and Russia and Austria in 1805. In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French Grande Armée invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The French emperor Napoleon successfully wheeled his army into the Austrian rear and defeated them at the Battle of Ulm, fought from 15 to 20 October. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz. The Treaty of Pressburg, signed soon afterwards, ended \n\n corps while Alvinczi led the main army in an advance from the east. The Austrians hoped to raise the siege of Mantua where Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser was trapped with a large garrison. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim. Davidovich scored a victory against Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Calliano and threatened Verona from the north. Meanwhile, Alvinczi repulsed one attack by Bonaparte at Bassano and advanced almost to the gates of Verona where he defeated a second French attack at Caldiero. Leaving Vaubois' battered division to contain Davidovich, Bonaparte massed every available man and tried to turn Alvinczi's left flank \n\n The French suffered 1,000 killed and wounded, plus 800 men and two artillery pieces captured. The Austrians lost 950 killed and wounded, and 350 captured. Having failed to dislodge the Austrians, Bonaparte contemplated a retreat behind the Adda River and potentially abandoning the blockade of Mantua. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again. Stripping Vaubois and Kilmaine of every available man, Bonaparte fell upon Alvinczi at the Battle of Arcola on 15–17 November and defeated the Austrians.\n\n In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an alliance of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Parliament of the United Kingdom (at the Palace of Westminster) legislates on matters such as taxation, foreign policy, defence, employment and trade. For elections to the House of Commons of this parliament, the city area is divided among five United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies, with each constituency returning one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. On 18 September 2014, Edinburgh voted \"No\" in the Scottish Independence Referendum by 61.1% to 38.9% with an 84.4% turnout rate.\n\n In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons has a quorum of 40 MPs, including the Speaker, out of 650 members of the House. There is no need for a quorum to be present at all times: commons debates could theoretically continue even if only one MP and the Speaker were present. However, if a division is called and fewer than 40 MPs are present, then a decision on the business being considered is postponed and the House moves on to consider the next item of business. The quorum for votes on legislation in the House of Lords is 30, but just three of the 753 peers, including the Lord Speaker, are required to be present for a debate to take place. Historically, the quorum was a select group of the justices of \n\n The House of Representatives is called the Lower House. It consists of 31 members, who are elected by the people in a general election every five years. Each member represents one constituency. Members of the House include both members of the ruling party and members of the opposition who won their seats in general election. The House of Representatives is presided over during their meetings by a speaker. The speaker's main responsibility is to maintain order and control. The House of Representatives passes bills, debates national issues and approves government budget.\n\n In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, members of the House elected at a by-election must be formally \"introduced\" to the House. (Members elected at a general election are not introduced.) The ceremony in the Commons is considerably simpler than those in the House of Lords. By-elections are generally held on Thursdays, and the introduction in the afternoon of the Tuesday after the election. The new Member enters the Chamber along with two other members acting as \"supporters\" and bows to the Speaker. The Member and supporters then process to the Speaker's table, where the new Member takes the Oath of Allegiance or Solemn Affirmation. Then, the Member signs the Test Roll, at the top of which the Oath is written. Finally, the Member returns to sit along with the rest of his or her party.\n\n The Parliament of the United Kingdom currently has 650 parliamentary constituencies across the constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each electing a single member of parliament (MP) to the House of Commons by the plurality (first past the post) voting system, ordinarily every five years. Voting last took place in all 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 12 December 2019. The number of seats rose from 646 to 650 at the 2010 general election after proposals made by the boundary commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies) were adopted through statutory instruments. Constituencies in Scotland remained unchanged, as the Boundary Commission for Scotland had completed a review just before the 2005 \n\nQuestion: In which parliament has the UK 87 seats for members who are elected for a five0-year term?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour. Nevertheless, the party gained a handful of local councillors in Stroud and Oxford. In the 1992 General Election, Cynog Dafis was elected on a Plaid Cymru–Wales Green Party ticket, gaining Ceredigion and Pembroke North from the Liberal Democrats. The Green Party argued that this made him the first Green representative in the House of Commons.

He succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister on 10 May 1940 and held the post until 26 July 1945. Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British re-armament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As prime minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy.

For example, if from 100 votes that were cast, 45 were for Candidate A, 30 were for Candidate B and 25 were for Candidate C, then Candidate A received a plurality of votes but not a majority. In some votes, the winning candidate or proposition may have only a plurality, depending on the rules of the organization holding the vote.\n\n in the United States, the lower house (Lok Sabha) in India, elections to the British House of Commons and English local elections in the United Kingdom, France (run-off election) and federal and provincial elections in Canada (although prior to 1956 three provinces used ranked voting in provincial elections). Plurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system in which a winning candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes: more votes than all other candidates combined. Under plurality voting, the leading candidate, whether or not he or she has a majority of votes, is elected. Both plurality and majoritarian systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies. In the latter \n\n In international institutional law, a \"simple majority\" (also a \"majority\") vote is more than half of the votes cast (disregarding abstentions) among alternatives; a \"qualified majority\" (also a \"supermajority\") is a number of votes above a specified percentage (e.g. two-thirds); a \"relative majority\" (also a \"plurality\") is the number of votes obtained that is greater than any other option; and an \"absolute majority\" is a number of votes \"greater than the number of votes that possibly can be obtained at the same time for any other solution\", when voting for multiple alternatives at a time. Henry Watson Fowler suggests that the American terms \"plurality\" and \"majority\" offer single-word alternatives for the corresponding two-word terms in British English, \"relative majority\" and \"absolute majority\", and that in British English \"majority\" is sometimes understood to mean \"receiving the most votes\" and can therefore be confused with \"plurality\". William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority.\n\n Plurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations. It is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and India. In single-winner plurality voting, each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the winner of the election is the candidate who represents a plurality of voters or, in other words, received the largest number of votes. That makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials. (However, the drawing of district boundary lines can be very contentious in the plurality system.) In an election for a legislative body with single-member seats, each voter in a geographically-defined electoral district may vote for one candidate from a list \n\n Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is, receive a plurality), are elected.

The legitimate descendants of Napoleon I became extinct with the death of the Duke of Reichstadt in 1832. Napoleon's brothers, Joseph and his younger brother Louis, have been successively his heirs. On the death of Louis in 1846, his son Louis Napoleon, the future Napoleon III, succeeded him as Bonapartist pretender. Napoleon III died in 1873, followed by his only son in 1879. The branch of Jerome became the elder branch of Bonaparte at that time. On May 27, 1996, Louis Napoléon (who died May 3, 1997), appointed by will his grandson Jean-Christophe to succeed him and not his son Charles Napoléon. The lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut, as an executor, revealed the political testament December 2, 1997. Charles Napoléon has stated that his republican convictions made him a stranger to the dynastic struggles, but he contested the will of his father.\n\n Joseph was born in 1768 to Carlo Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino at Corte, the capital of the Corsican Republic. In the year of his birth, Corsica was invaded by France and conquered the following year. His father was originally a follower of the Corsican patriot leader, Pasquale Paoli, but later became a supporter of French rule. Bonaparte trained as a lawyer. In that role and as a politician and diplomat, he served in the Cinq-Cents and as the French ambassador to Rome. On 30 September 1800, as Minister Plenipotentiary, he signed a treaty of friendship and commerce between France and the United States at Morfontaine, alongside Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, and Pierre Louis Roederer. In 1795 Bonaparte was a member of the Council of Ancients. Four years later, he used this position to help his brother Napoleon to overthrow the Directory. The Château de Villandry had been seized by the French Revolutionary government. In the early 19th century, his brother as Emperor Napoleon acquired the château for him.\n\n \"Appel au Peuple\" was the slogan of the Bonapartist party. The Nantes shipowner Alphonse-Alfred Haentjens founded the Appel au Peuple parliamentary group late in 1871 to restore the Second Empire's ideals of democratic imperialism and free trade. He looked for support among the rich winemakers of the southwest of France. Until this time the Bonapartists had concealed their views, but now they openly challenged both the Left and the Right. They claimed that they were more democratic than the Republicans, they mocked the Monarchists and they opposed Adolphe Thiers in his wish to tear up the low-tariff treaties of the empire. The Bonapartists did not have consistent views on democracy. Their program was deliberately vague, leaving it to the people to choose the form of the regime. The leaders assumed that a plebiscite, as in 1852, would produce a landslide in favour of return to an imperial system, but promised to respect the results of the plebiscite whatever they might be. Eugène Rouher, the emperor's former chief minister, joined the group in February 1872.\n\n divisions in the party were shown by the fact that Pierre Magne chose to join the cabinet of Albert de Broglie, whom most of the party despised, and that Prince Napoléon of the party's left wing did not attend the Chislehurst ceremony where the Prince Imperial was declared a full pretender. Most Bonapartists were nevertheless conservative, emphasising that the foundation of society was the family, religion and property, and the people should respect the social authorities. The effect was to cause some confusion between the Bonapartist and monarchist (legitimist or Orléanist) groups, who sometimes worked together to avoid splitting the vote in elections. In other cases they were bitter enemies. In Gers the \n\n vous form of address for Napoleon Bonaparte. Along with being the polite form of address in French, it also denotes respect for someone in a higher position of power. The tu is used in a disparaging way for Louis-Napoléon. It would be unthinkable that anybody should address the Emperor of the French in such a way. This form of address may denote familiarity between friends, but this is not Hugo's intention and it is used purely to belittle a futile leader. It is said that Napoleon III read the work thoroughly and kept a copy by his bedside. He is said to have been so devastated by Hugo's vicious condemnation that he never fully recovered from the shock of his first reading.

Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably Trevithick's Puffing Devil, in 1801, and his later London Steam Carriage of 1803, which circumvented Watt's condenser patent by simply removing it. The prevailing fear of early steam engineering, however, was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Watt, for example, wanted to have Trevithick imprisoned because of the danger his high-pressure engines introduced. Evans ignored the potential drawbacks, \n\n  A cotton mill is a building that houses spinning or weaving machinery for the production of yarn or cloth from cotton, an important product during the Industrial Revolution in the development of the factory system. Although some were driven by animal power, most early mills were built in rural areas at fast-flowing rivers and streams using water wheels for power. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802. The mechanisation of the spinning process in the early factories was instrumental in the growth of the machine tool industry, \n\n Atherton was a successful instrument and engine maker, who also designed and manufactured innovative machinery for the textile machinery during the eighteenth century. The first spinning mill to rely solely on steam power were not a commercial success. However, the first successful designs have been attributed to Atherton; a Warrington machine builder who helped Sir Richard Arkwright whilst in his late twenties. Atherton’s mills had 3,000 spindles and were powered by 30 horse power rotary engines. Like most entrepreneurs, he experienced early difficulties in recruiting capital. Initially he enlisted the help of William Harrison, a Manchester manufacturer, and later a J&T Hodgson, Liverpool merchants. By 1787 his inventions relating to the automation \n\n machinery. A beam engine and a horizontal steam engine were subsequently installed to supplement the power. The Hewes wheel broke in 1904 but the River Bollin continued to power the mill through two water turbines. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river's water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years. Steam engines could produce power all year round. Today the mill houses the most powerful working waterwheel in Europe, an iron wheel moved from Glasshouses Mill at Pateley Bridge designed by Sir William Fairbairn who had been Hewes' apprentice.\n\n Matthew Boulton (3 September 172817 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.

When he was hardly halfway through, she interrupted him. \"Formidable! [Fantastic!]\" she exclaimed. \"Formidable. This is the song I have been waiting for. It will be my biggest success!

Piaf dedicated \n\n He wrote songs until the 1960s, sometimes under an alias, for Dalida, Gloria Lasso, Luis Mariano and Tino Rossi. He worked with lyricist Michel Vaucaire. In 1956 they wrote Non, je ne regrette rien, recorded in 1960 by Édith Piaf. That led to more than 30 songs for her, such as Flonflons du Bal, Mon Dieu and Les Amants which Piaf and Dumont wrote and sang together in 1962. Dumont tells in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques, by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the popular French singer Rosalie Dubois. But, \n\n of Édith, he changed the title to \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (No, I Regret Nothing). According to journalist Jean Noli, in his book Édith (Éditions Stock 1973), when Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire visited Piaf's home at Boulevard Lannes in Paris, on 24 October 1960, she received them in a very impolite and unfriendly manner. Dumont had several times tried to offer Piaf his compositions, but she disliked them and had refused them – the standard was too low, according to her. On that day she was furious that her housekeeper Danielle had arranged a meeting with the two men without informing her. So she let them wait an hour in her living room \n\n Édith Piaf (,, ; born Édith Giovanna Gassion, ; 19 December 1915– 10 October 1963) was a French singer noted as France's national chanteuse and one of the country's most widely known international stars. Piaf's music was often autobiographical, and she specialized in chanson and torch ballads about love, loss and sorrow. Her most widely known songs include \"La Vie en rose\" (1946), \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (1960), \"Hymne à l'amour\" (1949), \"Milord\" (1959), \"La Foule\" (1957), \"L'Accordéoniste\" (1940), and \"Padam, padam...\" (1951). Since her death in 1963, several biographies and films have studied her life, including 2007's La Vie en rose. Piaf has become one of the most celebrated performers of the 20th century.\n\n Despite numerous biographies, much of the truth of Piaf's life is unknown. She was born Édith Giovanna Gassion in Belleville, Paris. Legend has it that she was born on the pavement of Rue de Belleville 72, but her birth certificate says that she was born on 19 December 1915 at the Hôpital Tenon, a hospital located in the 20th arrondissement. She was named Édith after the World War I British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed 2 months before Édith's birth for helping French soldiers escape from German captivity.

Their history as a focal point for the Black community and as a link between the Black and White worlds made them natural for this purpose. Martin Luther King Jr. was but one of many notable Black ministers involved in the movement. He helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957), serving as its first president. King received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through non-violent civil disobedience. He was assassinated in 1968. Ralph David Abernathy, Bernard Lee, Fred Shuttlesworth, C.T. Vivian and Jesse Jackson are among the many notable minister-activists. They were especially important during the later years of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n Major figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks were involved in the fight against the race-based discrimination of the Civil Rights Movement. Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat in 1955 sparked the Montgomery bus boycott—a large movement in Montgomery, Alabama that was an integral period at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. The Bus Boycott lasted a total of 381 days before the Supreme Court deemed that segregated seating is unconstitutional. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a peaceful activist and pastor, led many such protests, advocating for the improvement of African-Americans in American's \n\n \"Mother\" Pollard (c. 1882–1885 – before 1963) was an American church elder who participated in the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott. She has been called a civil rights hero for her tenacity in soothing the spirit of her pastor, Martin Luther King Jr. Pollard was an elder of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, during the time of the bus boycott. It was a seminal event in the civil rights movement that produced a political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system in Montgomery. King recounted in his writings that after several weeks of walking to her destinations rather than take the bus, he suggested to Mother Pollard, then about 72, that she might take the bus again for the sake of her health. She replied, \"My feets is tired, but my soul is rested.\" She was dubbed \"Mother\" because of her age; her real first name is unknown.\n\n Luther King, Sr., Martin Luther King Jr.'s father John Lewis, (21 Feb 1940 - 17 Jul 2020). Former U.S. Congressman, statesman, and civil rights activist and leader who  served as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966. Lewis was one of the \"Big Six\" leaders of groups who organized the 1963 March on Washington. He fulfilled many key roles in the civil rights movement and its actions to end legalized racial segregation in the United States. In 1965, Lewis led the first of three Selma to Montgomery marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

In 1925, he organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first mainly African-American labor union. In the early Civil Rights Movement and the Labor Movement, Randolph was a prominent voice. His continuous agitation with the support of fellow labor rights activists against unfair labor practices in relation to people of color eventually led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802 in 1941, banning discrimination in the defense industries during World War II. The group then successfully pressured President Harry S. Truman to issue Executive Order 9981 in 1948, ending segregation in the armed services. In 1963, Randolph was the head of the March on Washington, which was organized by Bayard Rustin, at which Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have A Dream\" speech. Randolph inspired the \"Freedom Budget\", sometimes called the \"Randolph Freedom budget\", which aimed to deal with the economic problems facing the black community, it was published by the Randolph Institute in January 1967 as \"A Freedom Budget for All Americans\".\n\nQuestion: Whose birthday is celebrated by a public holiday on the third Monday in January in the USA?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He could use higher flame temperatures by putting the boiling pans, which so far, hung over an open fire, on a grill of bricks. In 1575, William IV allowed him to drive a tunnel in the Hoher Meissner hillside of Schwalbental, to explore further the coal deposits on. Financed by the proceeds of Saline Soden, this was Germany's first brown coal mine. Despite initial success with the brown coal firing, Rhenanus was still not satisfied. The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. \n\n Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. The densification process raises the calorific value of low-rank coal to equal or exceed that of many export-grade black coals. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal. The Coldry Process is a patented coal upgrading technology being developed in Victoria, Australia by Environmental Clean Technologies Limited based on 'brown coal densification'. It has been developed specifically to improve low-rank brown coal (lignite) and some forms of sub-bituminous coal by removing the majority of the naturally occurring moisture content; harden and densify the coal; raise the calorific value of the coal; and transform the coal into a stable (lower spontaneous combustion risk), exportable black coal equivalent product for use by black coal fired power generators to produce electricity or as a feedstock for downstream processes such as coal-to-gas, oil and other high value chemicals.\n\n Black coal equivalent (BCE) is an export coal product derived from the Coldry Process, a patented coal upgrading technology operated by Environmental Clean Technologies Limited, in Victoria, Australia. The Coldry Process is applied to brown coal (lignite) with a typical moisture content of 60 per cent by weight and transforms the coal into a densified coal product of equal or better calorific value (5,800 kcal/kg) to typical export quality black coal, with less ash and sulfur content. Black coal equivalent derived from brown coal is ostensibly a 'cleaner' burning coal fuel than most black coals.\n\n Maddingley Mine near Bacchus Marsh Railway Station, Victoria, Australia contains a concentration of a particular brown coal (lignite) formation called Leonardite. A relatively high altitude formation, Maddingley brown coal is distinguished as having 60 per cent moisture content and a rich fulvic acid and humic acid content. A declared strategic State mining reserve, the estimated 400 million tonne deposit at Maddingley is the largest of three known deposits of high value Leonardite in the world, the others occurring in Mexico and Germany.\n\n Essentially, brown coal is sheared and attritioned reducing the mean particle size and releasing water naturally held in the porous coal microstructure forming a plastic mass. This dispersal of surface and physically trapped moisture lends itself to evaporative removal at or near ambient temperatures. Shearing also opens fresh coal surfaces exposing reactive molecular species, which participate in new bond-forming reactions and liberate some chemically trapped moisture. As the pellets densify, the newly formed structure shrinks, resulting in a significantly more compact microstructure compared to the original coal. This new structure significantly reduces the propensity to self-heat to that of a typical bituminous coal. When applied to lignite and some sub-bituminous coals, the Coldry process produces a feedstock in the form of densified pellets that significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared \n\nQuestion: What type of coal is brown and fibrous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Other substances are therefore added to simplify processing. One is the \"soda\", or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. However, the soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable. To provide for better chemical durability, the \"lime\" is also added. This is calcium oxide (CaO), generally obtained from limestone. In addition, magnesium oxide (MgO) and alumina, which is aluminium oxide (Al2O3), contribute to the durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight. \n\n Borosilicate glass is created by combining and melting boric oxide, silica sand, soda ash, and alumina. Since borosilicate glass melts at a higher temperature than ordinary silicate glass, some new techniques were required for industrial production. In addition to quartz, sodium carbonate, and aluminium oxide traditionally used in glassmaking, boron is used in the manufacture of borosilicate glass. The composition of low-expansion borosilicate glass, such as those laboratory glasses mentioned above, is approximately 80% silica, 13% boric oxide, 4% sodium oxide or potassium oxide and 2–3% aluminium oxide. Though more difficult to make than traditional glass due to its high melting temperature, it is economical to produce. Its superior durability, chemical and heat resistance finds use in chemical laboratory equipment, cookware, lighting, and in certain kinds of windows. The manufacturing process depends on the product geometry and can be differentiated between different methods like floating, tube drawing, or molding.\n\n  Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to \n\n mix of raw materials is termed batch. Soda–lime glass is divided technically into glass used for windows, called flat glass, and glass for containers, called container glass. The two types differ in the application, production method (float process for windows, blowing and pressing for containers), and chemical composition. Flat glass has a higher magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than container glass, and a lower silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. From the lower content of highly water-soluble ions (sodium and magnesium) in container glass comes its slightly higher chemical durability against water, which is required especially for storage of beverages and food.\n\n Refining is the removal of bubbles from the molten glass. Alternatively the term \"Fining\" is used, in this case, \"refining\" refers to the chemical processes only. Refining is supported by high temperature and stirring, as well as chemical reactions caused by refining agents. Refining agents increase the volume of bubbles and “seeds” (small bubbles), facilitating their ascension. For the most common types of glass production sulfate raw materials are used, in particular, Na2SO4, decomposing into SO2 and O2. Glass types that melt at comparatively high temperature, such as borosilicate glasses, use chlorides, such as NaCl, having a sufficiently high vapour pressure at refining temperatures. Alkali-free glasses with high melting temperature, such as LC display glasses, use tin oxide, SnO2. In the following cooling process gases from bubbles are reabsorbed in the melt. Redox agents such as Sb2O3 may release or absorb oxygen depending on temperature and composition. Apart from chemical refining, bubbling, i.e. direct blowing of gas into the melt is used. Less common are methods like ultrasonic refining or low-pressure refining.\n\nQuestion: What raw material is used for making glass?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

That is why they are great natural flavor enhancers in many dishes! **Mushrooms and truffles are fungi,** primitive plants that draw their nutrients from the partially decomposed tissues of more complex vegetation, such as trees. Their cell walls are made of chitin, a cholesterol-lowering dietary fiber. The common white mushroom was first cultivated by the French more than 300 years ago in abandoned gypsum quarries near Paris, but only recently has it become possible to cultivate a number of other species on a commercial scale. Thanks to this development, a wide range of mushrooms is now offered by many supermarkets. Truffles grow underground among the roots of certain oak, hazel, and linden trees. As a result of overharvesting and deforestation, truffles are now so rare and expensive that only minute shavings are used to flavor dishes. Attempts to grow them on a commercial scale have been unsuccessful so far. ### Health Benefits\n\n**Supports heart health. ** Mushrooms are one of the best plant-based sources of niacin: Studies have shown that niacin can help reduce the risk of heart disease and atherosclerosis.

They are used in the haute cuisine of France and Italy, sometimes as a less expensive, milder substitute for the Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum) when the latter are not available. Like other truffles, they are also packaged for export. With bodies (ascocarps) from 2 to 10 cm in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. Their brown or black outer skin (peridium) forms pyramidal warts about 3 to 9 mm wide, resembling rough bark. Burgundy truffles are harvested from September to late December, sometimes also until late January. They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species. Burgundy truffles are found across Europe, from Spain to eastern Europe and from Sweden to North Africa. In France they are found mainly in the north-east and in Italy, in the north. In the United Kingdom they were plentiful prior to the 20th century, but are now rare. Their distribution may not yet be definitively established: there are as of 2007 unconfirmed reports of findings in China.\n\n used in the production of tempeh.

It was circumscribed by mycologists Otto Miettinen and Leif Ryvarden in 2016, as a continuation of prior work that outlined a revised framework for the Steccherinaceae based on molecular phylogenetics. Its closest relative in the Steccherinaceae is the genus Nigroporus, from which it differs in its light-coloured fruit bodies and monomitic context. The generic name Trulla, from the Latin word for \"ladle\", alludes to the spatulate (spoon-like) shape of the fruit bodies. Microscopic characteristics of the genus include spores that are curved and cylindrical, cyanophilic skeletal hyphae (staining blue if the microscopic stain Lactophenol Cotton Blue is applied) and slightly thick-walled, wide generative hyphae in the context.\n\nQuestion: What kind of an organism is a truffle?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From the genome sequence of Arabidopsis, it has been estimated that more than 700 genes are required to synthesize, assemble, and remodel the plant cell wall. Figure 19–63 Scale model of a portion of a primary plant cell wall showing the two major polysaccharide networks. the orthogonally arranged layers of cellulose microfibrils (green) are tied into a network by the cross-linking glycans (red) that form hydrogen bonds with the microfibrils. this network is coextensive with a network of pectin polysaccharides (blue). the network of cellulose and cross-linking glycans provides tensile strength, while the pectin network resists compression. Cellulose, cross-linking glycans, and pectin are typically present in roughly equal amounts in a primary cell wall. the middle lamella is especially rich in pectin, and it cements adjacent cells together. Once a plant cell has left the meristem where it is generated, it can grow dramatically, commonly by more than a thousand times in volume. The manner of this expansion determines the final shape of each cell, and hence the final form of the plant as a whole. Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials. Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that they deposit in the wall (Figure 19–64).\n\n proteins is conserved, the glycan structures exhibit unique features suggesting a role of seagrass arabinogalactan proteins in osmoregulation. Further components of secondary walls of plants are cross-linked phenolic polymers called lignin, which are responsible for mechanical strengthening of the wall. In seagrasses, this polymer has also been detected, but often in lower amounts compared to angiosperm land plants. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. Dried seagrass leaves might be useful for papermaking or as insulating materials, so knowledge of cell wall composition has some technological relevance.\n\n The primary cell wall derives its notable tensile strength from cellulose molecules, or long-chains of glucose residues stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Cellulose chains are observed to align in overlapping parallel arrays, with the similar polarity forming a cellulose microfibril. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Glycan molecules increase the complexity of the potential networks plant-based cellulose can configure itself into. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. Additionally, cellulose microfibrils also contribute to the shape of the plant via controlled-cell expansion. The stereoscopic arrangement of microfibrils in the cell wall create systems of turgor pressure which ultimately leads to cellular growth and expansion. Cellulose microfibrils are unique matrix macromolecules, in that they are assembled by cellulose synthase enzymes located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules.\n\nThe formation of plant primary cell walls involves several components. The main components are polysaccharides, such as cellulose and pectins, and proteins. Polysaccharides make up the bulk of the cell wall, while proteins contribute up to about 5% of its dry mass.\n\nCellulose is a crucial polysaccharide in the primary cell wall. It forms a network of microfibrils that provide structural support. The backbone sugar molecules of cellulose form hydrogen bonds with the surface of microfibrils, cross-linking them together.\n\nPectins are another important class of polysaccharides found in primary cell walls. They are branched polysaccharides containing negatively charged galacturonic acid units. Pectins are highly hydrated and can form a gel-like matrix when cross-linked by calcium ions. Certain types of pectins are particularly abundant in the middle lamella, which is the region that cements adjacent cell walls together.\n\nProteins also play a role in the formation of primary cell walls. Some proteins act as enzymes responsible for wall turnover and remodeling during growth. However, the specific functions of these proteins are not well understood.\n\nOverall, the formation of plant primary cell walls involves the complex interplay between polysaccharides, including cellulose and pectins, and proteins. This combination of components provides strength, flexibility, and the ability to remodel the cell wall as necessary during plant growth.\n\nReference:\n- Adapted from \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\" by Alberts et al.\n\nThe primary cell wall of plants is composed of cellulose microfibrils interwoven with a network of pectic polysaccharides. Cellulose plays a critical role in providing tensile strength to the primary cell wall, which contributes to the overall strength and resilience of plant cells.\n\nThe primary cell wall enables plant cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the internal hydrostatic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall. This pressure is vital for cell expansion during growth and provides mechanical rigidity to plant tissues. In fact, turgor pressure can reach pressures of 10 or more atmospheres, significantly higher than the average car tire.\n\nCellulose, being a strong and rigid polysaccharide, provides the primary cell wall with its mechanical strength. The interwoven cellulose microfibrils form a structural framework that gives the cell wall the ability to withstand the internal turgor pressure and maintain its shape. This allows plant cells to sustain their internal pressure and prevents them from collapsing or losing their shape.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of cellulose in the primary cell wall contributes to the resilience of plant cells. When a plant cell is subjected to mechanical stress, cellulose provides resistance and helps maintain the integrity of the cell wall. This resilience enables plant cells to withstand external pressures and maintain their structural integrity under various environmental conditions.\n\nIn summary, cellulose plays a crucial role in the primary cell wall of plants by providing tensile strength and contributing to the overall strength, resilience, and plasticity of plant cells. Its presence allows plant cells to develop turgor pressure, sustain internal hydrostatic pressure, and maintain their structural integrity even under mechanical stress.\n\nReference:\n- The primary Cell Wall Is Built from Cellulose Microfibrils Interwoven with a Network of pectic polysaccharides\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the strong material found in plant cell walls?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Evaporation is a physiological mechanism by which the body releases heat through the conversion of liquid water into water vapor. This process occurs mainly through the skin, as sweat glands secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin. \n\nWhen the sweat comes into contact with the air, it evaporates, taking heat energy from the body in the process. As a result, the body cools down, helping to maintain a relatively stable internal temperature. This cooling effect is enhanced by factors such as air movement and low humidity, which promote quicker evaporation.\n\nDuring the evaporation process, an individual may experience sensations like feeling cooler or damp to the touch. Additionally, increased physical activity or emotional stress can also trigger the body to produce more sweat in order to cool down.\n\nIt is important to note that while evaporation is the primary mechanism for heat dissipation in a hot environment, the body also relies on other methods such as radiation, conduction, and convection to regulate body temperature. However, under conditions where the external temperature is equal to or higher than the body temperature, evaporation is the most effective means of heat dissipation.\n\nPlease keep in mind that while I strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, it is always advisable to consult a medical professional or trusted source for specific medical advice or concerns.\n\n In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient \"adiabatic approximation\". For example, the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings. In meteorology and oceanography, adiabatic cooling produces condensation of moisture or salinity, oversaturating the parcel. Therefore, the excess must be removed. There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated.\n\n For molecules of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces. When only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is low. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling. This is why evaporating sweat cools the human body. Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapor pressure. For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly \n\n temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. This means that when a nonvolatile solute is added, the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase is \n\nCondensation (gas to liquid) ΔH<0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat. ; Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH>0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools). Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus: Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2 °C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation and earth/clay render finishes.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the change of state from liquid to gas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, \n\nAn order: each number is either less or more than any other number. ; Algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a field. ; A measure: intervals of the real line have a specific length, which can be extended to the Lebesgue measure on many of its subsets. ; A metric: there is a notion of distance between points. ; A geometry: it is equipped with a metric and is flat. ; A topology: there is a notion of open sets. Its order and, independently, its metric structure induce its topology. ; Its order and algebraic structure make it into an ordered field. ; Its algebraic structure and topology make it into a Lie group, a type of topological group. The set of real numbers has several standard structures: There are interfaces among these:\n\n Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach sequences to others. All known human languages, except the Piraha language, have words for at least \"one\" and \"two\", and even some animals like the blackbird can distinguish a surprising number of items. Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven. See, for example, Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. By the High Middle Ages, the positional Hindu–Arabic numeral system had reached Europe, which allowed for systematic computation of numbers. During this \n\n Addition (usually signified by the plus symbol ) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the other three being subtraction, multiplication and division. The addition of two whole numbers results in the total amount or sum of those values combined. The example in the adjacent image shows a combination of three apples and two apples, making a total of five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression \"3 + 2 = 5\" (that is, \"3 plus 2 is equal to 5\"). Besides counting items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to concrete objects, using abstractions called numbers instead, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of mathematics. In algebra, another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects such as vectors, matrices, subspaces and subgroups. Addition has several important properties. It is \n\nQuestion: Which branch of science has four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall. The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may \n\nThe cause of sliding friction between solid objects is the chemical bonding between the surfaces. It is not solely caused by surface roughness, although surface roughness and contact area can affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. Sliding friction occurs when two contacting surfaces move relative to each other, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy or heat. This type of friction is also known as dry friction or kinetic friction. It should be noted that friction is not a fundamental force but is derived from electromagnetic forces between atoms and electrons. Internal friction, on the other hand, refers to the motion-resisting force between the surfaces of the particles making up a substance. \n\nReference: Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of two surfaces in contact or a surface in contact with a fluid (e.g., air on an aircraft or water in a pipe). It is not a fundamental force, as it is derived from electromagnetic forces between atoms and electrons, and so cannot be calculated from first principles, but instead must be found empirically. When contacting surfaces move relative to each other, the friction between the two objects converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, or heat. Friction between solid objects is often referred to as dry friction or sliding friction and between a solid and a gas or liquid as fluid friction. Both of these types of friction are called kinetic friction. Contrary to popular credibility, sliding friction is not caused by surface roughness but by chemical bonding between the surfaces.

When two objects are in contact, various factors can influence the amount of friction generated. However, one factor that friction does not depend on is the material composition of the surfaces in contact. Friction is primarily determined by the normal force and the nature of the surfaces involved, rather than the specific materials they are made of. Other factors that can affect friction include the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces, the presence of lubricants, and the surface area in contact. By considering these factors, we can better understand and predict the frictional forces between objects.\n\nDry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into static friction (\"stiction\") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperities (see Figure 1). ; Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.

(Bolt's average speed over the course of this race was 37.58 km/h or 23.35 mph.) Compared to quadrupedal animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but incapable of great speed. Examples of animals with higher sprinting speeds include cheetahs which can attain short bursts of speed well over 100 km/h (62 mph), the American quarter horse has topped 88 km/h (55 mph), greyhounds can reach 70 km/h (43 mph), and the Mongolian wild ass has been measured at 64 km/h (40 mph). Even the domestic cat may reach 48 km/h (30 mph).\n\n would be 1300 mph. The speed of the P. macropalpis is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, which is the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, with a recorded speed of 1.86 m/s, or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second, while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate. Sprinting (100 m.) 23.35 mph Long distance (marathon) 12.93 mph At distances greater than 400 metres, the human body requires oxygen to sustain such paces, and speed significantly tapers at this point.

Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal with running speeds reaching 61 –, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both rely on anaerobic metabolism and can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for up to a distance of approximately 500 yd, which is only about 20 seconds of sprinting, before fatigue and overheating set in. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed quietly walking towards the prey to shorten the distance before running at \n\n The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (0.225 m/s).

Rhex, a Reliable Hexapedal robot and Cheetah are the two fastest running robots so far. iSprawl is another hexapedal robot inspired by cockroach locomotion that has been developed at Stanford University. This robot can run up to 15 body length per second and can achieve speeds of up to 2.3 m/s.

The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. They appear to have originated in freshwater or a terrestrial environment. Sericytochromatia, the proposed name of the paraphyletic and most basal group, is the ancestor of both the non-photosynthetic group Melainabacteria and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also called Oxyphotobacteria. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light. Unlike heterotrophic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in \n\n increased cytosine methylation. Chromoplasts synthesize and store pigments such as orange carotene, yellow xanthophylls, and various other red pigments. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. The main evolutionary purpose of chromoplasts is probably to attract pollinators or eaters of colored fruits, which help disperse seeds. However, they are also found in roots such as carrots and sweet potatoes. They allow the accumulation of large quantities of water-insoluble compounds in otherwise watery parts of plants. When leaves change color in the autumn, it is due to the loss of green chlorophyll, which unmasks preexisting carotenoids. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\nChlorophyll plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue and red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while it is a poor absorber of green and near-green wavelengths. This selective absorption of light is why chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green.\n\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules capture photons of light energy. These captured photons excite electrons within the chlorophyll molecule, causing them to become energized. The energized electrons are then used to power the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores and transports energy within cells.\n\nAdditionally, chlorophyll participates in another important step of photosynthesis called the Calvin cycle or dark reaction. In this stage, chlorophyll helps convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) through a series of chemical reactions.\n\nOverall, chlorophyll's ability to absorb light energy and transfer it to other molecules allows plants to carry out photosynthesis efficiently. Its green color arises from its selective absorption properties, reflecting or transmitting green light while absorbing other colors from the visible spectrum.\n\nReference:\n- Chlorophyll (Wikipedia)\n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Thus, the leaves of summer are characteristically green. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide. These sugars are the basis of the plant's nourishment – the sole source of the carbohydrates needed for growth \n\n extended spectral regions, such as the near-infrared. These bacteria live in environments such as the bottom of stagnant ponds, sediment and ocean depths. Because of their pigments, they form colorful mats of green, red and purple. Chlorophyll, the most abundant plant pigment, is most efficient in capturing red and blue light. Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. An exception to the predominance of chlorophyll is autumn, when chlorophyll is degraded (because it contains N and Mg) but the accessory pigments \n\nQuestion: What is the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following a 20-year career in the arts, Althea then took up a career in science, specifically ornithology, due to her skills as an observer and illustrator. Rather than killing any birds, Althea became a strong pioneer in the life study of birds, setting up nest boxes and creating feeding areas for birds to be observed. From her home in Iowa, Sherman subscribed to a total of 26 scientific and ornithological journals and joined 15 societies. Sherman used her skills as an artist to meticulously study and detail her observations and studies, publishing over 70 articles on 38 species over her career that spanned three decades. Articles were published in journals such as: Her research led to her being elected as a member of the American Ornithologists' Union and inclusion in the Who's Who of Women in Science and American Men of Science.\n\n The Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds was written by the English naturalist and army officer George Montagu, and first published by J. White of Fleet Street, London in 1802. It was one of the texts, along with Thomas Bewick's contemporaneous A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the cirl bunting, discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon. The first edition was admired by biologists including Charles Darwin and David Lack. A second edition, extensively revised by James Rennie in 1831, was panned by scientific critics.\n\n  Feathers are epidermal growths that form a distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on dinosaurs, both avian (bird) and some non-avian (non-bird) and possibly other archosauromorphs. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups. Although feathers cover most of the bird's body, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. In addition, coloration helps in communication and protection. Plumology (or plumage science) is the name for the science that is associated with the study of feathers. Feathers have a number of utilitarian, cultural, and religious uses. Feathers are both soft and excellent at trapping heat; thus, they are sometimes used in high-class bedding, especially \n\n The Ornithological Council is an association of ornithological organisations based in the Americas involved in bird study and conservation.

Since then they have been joined by CIPAMEX, the Neotropical Ornithological Society, the Society of Canadian Ornithologists and the Society for the Conservation and Study of Caribbean Birds. The Council focuses not only on issues affect birds and their survival, but also the needs of ornithologists. It tries to resolve conflicts and promotes sound management and the sustainable use of natural resources. Issues include funding for research and educational programs, government regulations and permits for research activities, decision-making in habitat and biodiversity management, the impacts of birds on fisheries, in agriculture and in urban areas, threatened species, the role of birds in ecosystems, and standards concerning the use and maintenance of live birds in research.\n\nQuestion: What id the name given to the study of birds?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the only living member of the family Carettochelyidae, which are related to softshell turtles.\n\n The Apalachicola snapping turtle (Macrochelys apalachicolae) is a proposed species that lives in the Apalachicola River, United States. It has traditionally been included as part of the widespread species M. temminckii, but an analysis in 2014 recommended treating it as distinct. A study published the following year considered this change unwarranted and recommended that M. apalachicolae should be considered a junior synonym of M. temminckii, and this is followed by the Reptile Database, IUCN's Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group, and the Committee On Standard English And Scientific Names (Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles).\n\n The Vietnamese leaf turtle is also known as the black-breasted leaf turtle or black-breasted hill turtle. This turtle is native to Vietnam and China. This animal is currently endangered.\n\n Jiangxichelys is an extinct genus of nanhsiungchelyid turtle which existed in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China during the latest Cretaceous epoch. It was first named by Haiyan Tong and Jinyou Mo in 2010 and the type species is Jiangxichelys ganzhouensis. It was an aquatic omnivore, as modern turtles are today.\n\n The species is distributed in China, but only on the island of Hainan (it is extirpated from the mainland Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces), as well as Hong Kong. The populations from other parts of Vietnam and Laos are now regarded a separate species, the Vietnamese three-striped box turtle (C. cyclornata).\n\nQuestion: Of which reptile are there only two species, one living in the Mississippi and the other in China?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its uses range from gelling agents in food, to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. Molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties, by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours. Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed.\n\n  Microalgae, also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae, constitute the majority of cultivated algae. Macroalgae commonly known as seaweed also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild. In 2016, aquaculture was the source of 96.5 percent by volume of the total 31.2 million tonnes of wild-collected and cultivated aquatic plants combined. Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995 to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016.\n\n The brown algae (singular: alga), comprising the class Phaeophyceae, are a large group of multicellular algae, including many seaweeds located in colder waters within the Northern Hemisphere. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat. For instance, Macrocystis, a kelp of the order Laminariales, may reach 60 m in length and forms prominent underwater kelp forests. Kelp forests like these contain a high level of biodiversity. Another example is Sargassum, which creates unique floating mats of seaweed in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea that serve as the habitats for many species. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Some members of the class, such as kelps, are used by humans as food. Between 1,500 \n\n $640 million. The largest producer of industrial carrageenan was the Philippines, where cultivated seaweed produces about 80% of the world supply, while China is the main exporter to global markets in the US and Europe. The most commonly used sources are E. cottonii (Kappaphycus alvarezii, K. striatum) and E. spinosum (Eucheuma denticulatum), which together provide about three-quarters of the world production. These grow from the sea surface to a depth of about 2 metres. The seaweed is normally grown on nylon lines strung between bamboo floats, and it is harvested after three months or so, when each plant weighs approximately 1 \n\n Alginates are refined from brown seaweeds. Throughout the world, many of the Phaeophyceae class brown seaweeds are harvested to be processed and converted into sodium alginate. Sodium alginate is used in many industries including food, animal food, fertilisers, textile printing, and pharmaceuticals. Dental impression material uses alginate as its means of gelling. Food grade alginate is an approved ingredient in processed and manufactured foods. Brown seaweeds range in size from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera which can be 20–40 meters long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2–4 m long, to smaller species 30–60 cm long. Most brown seaweed used for alginates are gathered from the wild, with the exception of Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China. Alginates from different species of brown seaweed vary in their chemical structure resulting in \n\nQuestion: What type of seaweed grows up to 100 meters in length, and is farmed for its alginates?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Hemoglobin is a heterotetrameric protein found in red blood cells and functions as an oxygen transport protein. It carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. On the other hand, myoglobin is a monomeric protein mainly found in muscle tissue and serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen.\n\nBoth hemoglobin and myoglobin have a heme group, which contains iron that binds to oxygen. The oxygen is directly bound to the ferrous (Fe2+) iron atom in the heme prosthetic group. When the iron is oxidized to the ferric (Fe3+) state, the molecule is unable to bind oxygen and is referred to as hemin.\n\nThe tertiary structure of myoglobin is that of a typical water-soluble globular protein. It has a high proportion of α-helical secondary structure. Each myoglobin molecule contains a single heme group inserted into a hydrophobic cleft in the protein. Hydrophobic interactions between the tetrapyrrole ring of the heme and hydrophobic amino acid side chains within the protein stabilize the heme-protein complex. A nitrogen atom from a histidine side chain also coordinates with the iron atom, further stabilizing the interaction.\n\nIn summary, hemoglobin and myoglobin play crucial roles in oxygen transport and storage in the body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the body, while myoglobin stores oxygen within muscle tissue. Both proteins rely on their heme groups, which bind and release oxygen as needed.\n\nMyoglobin (Mb) plays a significant role in terms of protein structure and oxygen storage. It is a small, globular protein primarily responsible for storing oxygen in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. Mb contains a single heme molecule and has a molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa.\n\nIn terms of protein structure, early studies on myoglobin were important milestones in the field of protein structure determination. John Kendrew and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to reveal the three-dimensional structure of sperm whale myoglobin, making it the first protein to have its atomic structure determined. This groundbreaking achievement earned Kendrew the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962.\n\nIn terms of its role in oxygen storage, myoglobin helps regulate cellular oxygen tension in respiring tissues. It binds and stores oxygen in muscle tissues, allowing for its release when needed during muscle contractions. This enables efficient oxygen delivery and utilization in muscle cells.\n\nAdditionally, myoglobin is also involved in the regulation of the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule. In vascular smooth muscle cells, myoglobin can convert nitrite to NO under hypoxic conditions, contributing to vasodilation. This further highlights the physiological significance of myoglobin beyond its role in oxygen storage.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that recent research involving myoglobin has included the development of assays for serum myoglobin detection and additives to preserve the red coloring of fresh meat. The study of myoglobin has also extended to non-muscle tissues of fish species and mammalian cancer cells, suggesting its potential involvement in other biological processes.\n\nOverall, myoglobin's significance lies in its role as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue and its contribution to regulating cellular oxygen tension and the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Its structural studies have also been instrumental in advancing our understanding of protein structure.\n\n MyoD, also known as myoblast determination protein 1, is a protein in animals that plays a major role in regulating muscle differentiation. MyoD, which was discovered in the laboratory of Harold M. Weintraub, belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). These bHLH (basic helix loop helix) transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation. Vertebrate MRF family members include MyoD1, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6). In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found. MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment. MyoD is expressed at extremely low and essentially undetectable levels in quiescent satellite cells, but expression of MyoD is activated in response to exercise or muscle tissue damage. The effect of MyoD on satellite cells is dose-dependent; high MyoD expression represses cell renewal, promotes terminal differentiation and can induce apoptosis. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene. This is likely due to functional redundancy from Myf5 and/or Mrf4. Nevertheless, the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis.\n\nMyoglobin (symbol Mb or MB) is an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals. Myoglobin is distantly related to hemoglobin. Compared to hemoglobin, myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not have cooperative binding with oxygen like hemoglobin does.  In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. \n\nHigh concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A, and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle. \n\nMyoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed by X-ray crystallography. This achievement was reported in 1958 by John Kendrew and associates. For this discovery, Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz. Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology, its physiological function is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin can be viable and fertile, but show many cellular and physiological adaptations to overcome the loss. Through observing these changes in myoglobin-depleted mice, it is hypothesised that myoglobin function relates to increased oxygen transport to muscle, and to oxygen storage; as well, it serves as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.\n\nIn humans, myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene.\n\nMyoglobin can take the forms oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb), analogously to hemoglobin taking the forms oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb).\n\nDifferences from hemoglobin\nLike hemoglobin, myoglobin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds oxygen on a heme group. It harbors only one globulin group, whereas hemoglobin has four. Although its heme group is identical to those in Hb, Mb has a higher affinity for oxygen than does hemoglobin. This difference is related to its different role: whereas hemoglobin transports oxygen, myoglobin's function is to store oxygen.\n\nRole in cuisine\nMyoglobin contains hemes, pigments responsible for the colour of red meat. The colour that meat takes is partly determined by the degree of oxidation of the myoglobin. In fresh meat the iron atom is in the ferrous (+2) oxidation state bound to an oxygen molecule (O2). Meat cooked well done is brown because the iron atom is now in the ferric (+3) oxidation state, having lost an electron. If meat has been exposed to nitrites, it will remain pink because the iron atom is bound to NO, nitric oxide (true of, e.g., corned beef or cured hams). Grilled meats can also take on a reddish pink \"smoke ring\" that comes from the heme center binding to carbon monoxide. Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink \"smoke ring\" due to the same principles. Notably, the surface of this raw meat also displays the pink color, which is usually associated in consumers' minds with fresh meat. This artificially induced pink color can persist, reportedly up to one year. Hormel and Cargill (meat processing companies in the US) are both reported to use this meat-packing process, and meat treated this way has been in the consumer market since 2003.\n\nRole in disease\nMyoglobin is released from damaged muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis), which has very high concentrations of myoglobin. The released myoglobin is filtered by the kidneys but is toxic to the renal tubular epithelium and so may cause acute kidney injury.  It is not the myoglobin itself that is toxic (it is a protoxin) but the ferrihemate portion that is dissociated from myoglobin in acidic environments (e.g., acidic urine, lysosomes).\n\nMyoglobin is a sensitive marker for muscle injury, making it a potential marker for heart attack in patients with chest pain. However, elevated myoglobin has low specificity for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and thus CK-MB, cardiac troponin, ECG, and clinical signs should be taken into account to make the diagnosis.\n\nStructure and bonding\nMyoglobin belongs to the globin superfamily of proteins, and as with other globins, consists of eight alpha helices connected by loops.  Myoglobin contains 153 amino acids.\n\nMyoglobin contains a porphyrin ring with an iron at its center. A proximal histidine group (His-93) is attached directly to iron, and a distal histidine group (His-64) hovers near the opposite face.  The distal imidazole is not bonded to the iron but is available to interact with the substrate O2.  This interaction encourages the binding of O2, but not carbon monoxide (CO), which still binds about 240× more strongly than O2.\n\nThe binding of O2 causes substantial structural change at the Fe center, which shrinks in radius and moves into the center of N4 pocket.  O2-binding induces \"spin-pairing\": the five-coordinate ferrous deoxy form is high spin and the six coordinate oxy form is low spin and diamagnetic.\n\nSynthetic analogues\nMany models of myoglobin have been synthesized as part of a broad interest in transition metal dioxygen complexes.  A well known example is the picket fence porphyrin, which consists of a ferrous complex of a sterically bulky derivative of tetraphenylporphyrin. In the presence of an imidazole ligand, this ferrous complex reversibly binds O2.  The O2 substrate adopts a bent geometry, occupying the sixth position of the iron center.  A key property of this model is the slow formation of the μ-oxo dimer, which is an inactive diferric state.  In nature, such deactivation pathways are suppressed by protein matrix that prevents close approach of the Fe-porphyrin assemblies.\n\nSee also \n Cytoglobin\n Hemoglobin\n Hemoprotein\n Neuroglobin\n Phytoglobin\n Myoglobinuria - The presence of myoglobin in the urine\n Ischemia-reperfusion injury of the appendicular musculoskeletal system\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n .

In aerobic terrestrial environments, a majority of cellulose breakdown is broken down by wood-decay fungi commonly and collectively known as white rot and soft rot. Complex enzymes are secreted by the various fungi, converting cellulose into a carbon form that can be utilized by the fungus, and subsequently any organism up the food chain.\n\n Without gut flora, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes, because some types of gut flora have enzymes that human cells lack for breaking down certain polysaccharides. Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins. Bacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short-chain fatty acids by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation. Products include acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. These materials can \n\n water and nutrient absorption of most plants and confers resistance to some plant pathogens. Mycelium is an important food source for many soil invertebrates. They are vital to agriculture and are important to almost all species of plants many species co-evolving with the fungi. Mycelium is a primary factor in a plant's health, nutrient intake, and growth, with mycelium being a major factor to plant fitness. \"Mycelium\", like \"fungus\", can be considered a mass noun, a word that can be either singular or plural. The term \"mycelia\", though, like \"fungi\", is often used as the preferred plural form. Sclerotia are compact or hard masses of mycelium.\n\n Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. The cellulose accounts the majority of the cell from 40% to 50% of the wood's total mass. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate with accounts 20% to 30% of the wood's cell.\n\n Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller polysaccharides called cellodextrins or completely into glucose units; this is a hydrolysis reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other polysaccharides. However, this process can be significantly intensified in a proper solvent, e.g. in an ionic liquid. Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose. Some ruminants like cows and sheep contain certain symbiotic anaerobic bacteria (such as Cellulomonas and Ruminococcus spp.) in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. The breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for proliferation. The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its digestive system (stomach and small intestine). Horses use cellulose in their diet by fermentation in their hindgut. Some termites contain in their hindguts certain flagellate protozoa producing such enzymes, whereas others contain bacteria or may produce cellulase. The enzymes used to cleave the glycosidic linkage in cellulose are glycoside hydrolases including endo-acting cellulases and exo-acting glucosidases. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include dockerins and carbohydrate-binding modules.\n\nQuestion: What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest Early Cretaceous and early Late Cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and \n\n of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called \"drones\" and one or more fertile females called \"queens\" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony. Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their \n\n Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis. Formica polyctena, among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials. Some ant species, such as those that use natural cavities, can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled micro-climate provided inside human dwellings and other artificial structures to house their colonies and nest structures.\n\n Though all castes defend their nests in the event of invasion, a true soldier caste, with individuals called majors, exists. They are larger than other workers, and use their large, sharp mandibles, powered by huge adductor muscles, to defend their colonies from large enemies, such as vertebrates. When a foraging area is threatened by conspecific or interspecific ant competitor, the majority of respondents are smaller workers from other castes, since they are more numerous, and therefore better suited for territorial combat. Tasks are divided not only by size, but by the age of individuals workers, as well. Young workers of most subcastes tend to work inside the \n\n  In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called \"soldier\" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their \"duties\" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation in the size \n\nQuestion: Which family of insects has species named 'drivers', 'weavers', 'and even individuals called 'soldiers'?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

One of the main challenges was the methodological aspect. Ethologists were accustomed to studying animal behavior, which often involved direct observation and experimentation. However, studying human behavior posed different challenges.\n\nUnlike animals in controlled laboratory settings, studying humans required access to natural environments such as kindergartens, schools, and communities. Ethologists had to find ways to observe and document human behavior in these natural settings without interfering or altering it. This was particularly important to ensure that the behavior being studied was a true representation of natural human behavior.\n\nAnother challenge was the conceptual shift from studying animal behavior to studying human behavior. Ethologists had to adapt their knowledge and methodologies to the unique characteristics of human behavior. Humans have a complex culture, language, and cognition, which added layers of complexity to the study of their behavior. Ethologists had to develop new frameworks and theories to understand and analyze human behavior effectively.\n\nAdditionally, there were ethico-political challenges that arose from crossing the human-animal divide. Studying human behavior raised questions about privacy, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of human subjects. Ethologists had to ensure that their research adhered to ethical guidelines and respected the rights and dignity of the individuals being studied.\n\nOverall, the challenges faced by human ethologists in the 1960s and 1970s included developing appropriate methodologies for studying human behavior in natural settings, adapting to the unique characteristics of human behavior, and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding the study of human subjects. These challenges required innovative approaches and considerations to expand the field of human ethology.\n\nEvolutionary neuroscience is conceptually and theoretically related to various fields. It draws on concepts and findings from both neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Historically, most empirical work in this field has focused on comparative neuroanatomy. However, the conceptual and theoretical connections extend beyond this area.\n\nOne related field is comparative psychology, which examines behavior across different species to understand the evolution of cognitive abilities. Evolutionary neuroscience can contribute to our understanding of how neural structures and functions have evolved to support specific behaviors.\n\nNeuroethology is another relevant field that investigates the neural basis of animal behavior in natural environments. By studying the evolutionary origins of neural circuits involved in behaviors such as foraging or mate selection, evolutionary neuroscience can shed light on how these circuits have been shaped by natural selection.\n\nDevelopmental neurobiology explores how nervous systems develop over time. Understanding the evolutionary changes that have occurred during development can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying brain evolution.\n\nThe emerging field of evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology) also intersects with evolutionary neuroscience. Evo-devo seeks to uncover the genetic and developmental processes that drive morphological diversity across species, including variations in brain structure.\n\nBehavioral ecology examines how animals' behaviors are influenced by ecological factors. Evolutionary neuroscience can contribute by elucidating how neural adaptations have allowed animals to respond effectively to their environment.\n\nAnthropology explores human evolution and cultural variation. Evolutionary neuroscience can provide insights into the neurological underpinnings of human behavior and cognition, helping us understand how our brains have evolved over time.\n\nFinally, evolutionary psychology investigates how psychological traits may have evolved through natural selection. Evolutionary neuroscience can contribute by examining the neural mechanisms underlying these traits, providing a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origins.\n\nIn summary, while empirical work in evolutionary neuroscience has primarily focused on comparative neuroanatomy, conceptually and theoretically it is connected to fields such as comparative psychology, neuroethology, developmental neurobiology, evo-devo, behavioral ecology, anthropology, and evolutionary psychology. These interdisciplinary connections allow for a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and natural history of nervous system structure and function.\n\n Anthrozoology (also known as \"human–animal studies\") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.\n\nA phenomenological approach can enhance our understanding of animal behavior in ethology, including a specific behavior pattern observed in mice, by providing insights into the psychological meaning and cognitive world of the animals. Unlike classical ethology, which focuses on the evolutionary, functional, mechanistic, and developmental aspects of behavior, phenomenology explores the mental processes and subjective experiences of animals.\n\nBy adopting a phenomenological approach, researchers can delve into the conscious experiences and perspectives of mice, allowing for a deeper understanding of their behavior. This approach encompasses empirical observations that offer preliminary insights into the behavior pattern, such as carrying the tail in mice. These initial observations prompt researchers to make epistemic choices regarding the spatial and object notions influencing the behavior.\n\nFurthermore, a phenomenological approach goes beyond simple cause-and-effect explanations and acknowledges the limitations of such reductionist interpretations. It recognizes that behavior cannot be solely attributed to external stimuli or physiological mechanisms. Instead, this approach proposes an interpretative model that integrates a phenomenological conceptual framework. This model considers the conscious experiences, intentions, and subjective realities of the mice, shedding light on the significance of the behavior pattern in question.\n\nBy combining the insights gained from a phenomenological approach with traditional ethological methods, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of animal behavior. This integrated approach enables a holistic view of ethology, bridging the gap between the study of behavior and the study of mental processes, ultimately enriching our understanding of animal behavior patterns in relation to their cognitive worlds.\n\n Ethology links the study of animal behavior and biological perspectives to human behavior and social organization. Ethologist Konrad Lorenz was the first to describe the Kewpie doll effect and propose the effect's possible evolutionary significance, followed by the work of Thomas Alley in 1981.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the study of animal behavior?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the evolution of early plants, abiotic means, including water and much later, wind, transported sperm for reproduction. The first plants were aquatic, as described in the page Evolutionary history of plants, and released sperm freely into the water to be carried with the currents. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. As taller and more complex plants evolved, modifications in the alternation of generations evolved. In the Paleozoic era progymnosperms reproduced by using spores dispersed on the wind. The seed plants including seed ferns, conifers and cordaites, which were all gymnosperms, evolved 350 million years ago. \n\nYes, the stomata in highly elaborated Oedipodium and highly reduced Ephemerum moss sporophytes are remarkably similar. The ultrastructure of stomata in these mosses is highly similar to each other, and less variable compared to tracheophytes (vascular plants). Both Oedipodium and Ephemerum have anatomical features such as the presence of a cuticle, water-conducting cells, and spongy tissues with large areas for gas exchange.\n\nHowever, there are some subtle differences between the two moss species. Oedipodium sporophytes have extensive spongy tissue along the apophysis, while Ephemerum has minimal substomatal cavities. The stomatal ultrastructure and wall thickenings are highly similar in both species. Additionally, the sporophytes of both mosses are covered by a cuticle that is thicker on the guard cells and extends along the walls surrounding the pore.\n\nThese anatomical features in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses support the role of stomata in gas exchange and water transport during development and maturation. The presence of stomata exclusively on the capsules of these mosses suggests that stomata in moss may also play a role in drying and dispersal of spores.\n\nOverall, while there are some differences in specific anatomical features, the ultrastructure of stomata in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses is remarkably similar, highlighting the importance of stomata in land plants for gas exchange, water transport, and potentially spore dispersal.\n\n along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths. Another characteristic feature of the species (and the genus) is its parallel photosynthetic lamellae on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. This is an example of a xeromorphic adaption, an adaptation for dry conditions. Moist air is trapped in between the rows of lamellae, \n\n This moss is unisexual, with males in either full-size, dwarfed or leaf-attached forms. Often males can only be observed with a hand-lens. The reproductive plant is obvious with the presence of the sporophyte. This is typically evidenced by the brown seta standing erect with the capsule attached. It will only brown once it has reached full maturity and is no longer required to perform photosynthesis to sustain its growth. This structure is protected by a calyptra, which acts like a protective cap while growing. Desiccation will continue until the operculum begins to open. The peristome, the final boundary to the spores, will absorb water during rains, opening to create a cavity in the sporophyte from which the spores can be released. This will the allow the tiny spores (between 10-12um) to be dispersed by wind and rain.\n\n Bryophytes are non-vascular plants encompassing mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, which most often form symbioses with members from the cyanobacterial genus Nostoc. Depending on the host, the cyanobiont can be inside (endophytic) or outside the host (epiphytic). In mosses, cyanobacteria are major nitrogen fixers and grow mostly epiphytically, aside from two species of Sphagnum which protect the cyanobiont from an acidic-bog environment. In terrestrial Arctic environments, cyanobionts are the primary supplier of nitrogen to the ecosystem whether free-living or epiphytic with mosses. Cyanobacterial associations with liverworts are rare, with only four of 340 genera of liverworts harbouring symbionts. Two of the genera, Marchantia and Porella, are epiphytic, while the genera Blasia and Cavicularia are endophytic. In hornworts however, endophytic cyanobionts have been described in more than triple the number of genera relative to liverworts. Bryophytes and their cyanobacterial symbionts possess different structures \n\nQuestion: Mosses are classified as belonging to which part of the plant kingdom?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They glide using a flap of skin called a patagium. Since they are arboreal mammals, they spend most of their life in old growth temperate rain forests in the high canopy. They are a non-migrating species and typically stay near areas in which they were born. They are active all year, even in the winter, because they do not hibernate. During cold weather in the winter, they huddle together to conserve heat. Groups as large as ten individuals have been documented. They are nocturnal with greatest activity right before dawn and right after dusk. They rest in dens during inactive times. They have a strong olfactory sense that helps them to detect food. The POW flying squirrel tends to utilize dens in tree cavities or snags for storing food, hiding from predators, and reproduction. They do not spend much time on the ground in order to avoid predation. Northern flying squirrels are considered to be one of the most aerodynamic of mammals with the ability to travel between 3 and 45 meters in one glide. They travel between the trees to feed and in search of dens.\n\n There are approximately 15 species in this genus, and over 60 subspecies. These squirrels range in length from 13 to 27 cm, not including the tail which is often about the same length as the body. Most are rather dull olive-brown to gray and several have a pale and dark stripe on their side, however a few are very colorful. The Pallas's squirrel may have an unremarkable olive-gray back, while its belly is often –but not always– bright red. The \"typical\" subspecies of Prevost's squirrels have black backs, white sides, and red-brown undersides. The Finlayson's squirrel occurs in numerous varieties, three of which are overall red-brown, overall black, or pure white. Most squirrels in Callosciurus live in tropical rain forests, but some individuals live in parks and gardens in cities. In the trees, they build their nests out of plant material. They are solitary, and give birth to one to five young. Their food consists of nuts, fruits, and seeds, and also of insects and bird eggs.\n\n a form of coloration known as counter shading. The dorsal fur is a silver gunmetal gray, with pure white on the underside; there may be black flecks in the tail. Ears are large but without tufts. The ears turn reddish-brown at the back in the winter. The tail is long and typically very bushy. Also, it stays in a curved upwards in an \"S\" shape. Tree squirrels undergo a complete head-to-tail molt in the spring and a rump-to-head molt in the fall. Tail hair is replaced only in the spring. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. The dental formula for Sciurus griseus is.\n\n The mountain ground squirrel (Geosciurus princeps) is a rodent that is native to southwestern Angola, western Namibia, and western South Africa. It is also known as the Kaoko ground squirrel or the Damara ground squirrel. It is the closest relative of the Cape ground squirrel (Latin name Geosciurus inauris), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. Geosciurus princeps is slightly larger, on average, than G. inauris, although there is considerable overlap in body size. Differences in skull morphology also distinguish the two species, and the incisors are yellow to orange rather than white as in G. inauris.\n\n The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America and an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands, and is a resource of food and fur for humans. Adult muskrats weigh 0.6 - 2 kg, with a body length of 20 - 35 cm. They are covered with short, thick fur of medium to dark brown color. Their long tails, covered with scales rather than hair, are their main means of propulsion. Muskrats spend most of their time in the water, and can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes.

Most plants are made up of stems, roots, leaves, flowers, and produce fruits containing seeds. Humans most commonly eat the seeds (e.g. maize, wheat),  fruit (e.g. tomato, avocado, banana), flowers (e.g. broccoli), leaves (e.g. lettuce, spinach, and cabbage), roots (e.g. carrots, beets), and stems (e.g. [asparagus] of many plants. There are also a few edible petioles (also known as leaf stems) such as celery or rhubarb. Plant stems have a variety of functions. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage.\n\n Chromoplasts are found in fruits, flowers, roots, and stressed and aging leaves, and are responsible for their distinctive colors. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. The conversion of chloroplasts to chromoplasts in ripening is a classic example. They are generally found in mature tissues and are derived from preexisting mature plastids. Fruits and flowers are the most common structures for the biosynthesis of carotenoids, although other reactions occur there as well including the synthesis of sugars, starches, lipids, aromatic compounds, vitamins, and hormones. The DNA in chloroplasts and chromoplasts is identical. One subtle difference in DNA was found after a liquid chromatography analysis of tomato chromoplasts was conducted, \n\n  The phycoplast is a microtubule structure observed during cytokinesis in members of the Chlorophytina, the largest and most well known subphylum of chlorophyte green algae. Cytokinesis in green algae occurs via a diverse range of mechanisms, including cleavage furrows in some algae and cell plates in others. Plants (=Chloroplastida) of the clade Phragmoplastophyta (a subgroup of charophytes which includes the land plants, desmids, water silk, stoneworts etc.) use structures called phragmoplasts to organize and guide the growing cell plate. In these plants, the microtubules of the telophase spindle give rise to the phragmoplast and are oriented perpendicular to the plane of cell division and the forming cell plate. The growth of the \n\nNutrient aery, also known as nutrient flow or transport, refers to the movement of nutrients within a plant. Nutrients are essential for a plant's growth and development, and they are typically absorbed by the plant's roots from the soil. Once absorbed, nutrients can move in different directions within the plant, which includes upward and downward transport. \n\nThe upward movement, known as the xylem pathway, occurs from the roots to the stems and leaves. This process is driven by transpiration, a process where water evaporates from the plant's leaves, creating a suction force that pulls water and nutrients upward. The xylem vessels in plants are responsible for this upward transportation of nutrients.\n\nOn the other hand, the downward movement of nutrients, known as the phloem pathway, occurs from the leaves towards the roots. The phloem vessels are responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds synthesized in the leaves to the rest of the plant, including the roots.\n\nIt's important to note that nutrient transportation within plants is a complex process involving multiple factors such as osmosis, diffusion, active transport, and various physiological processes. Thus, the direction of nutrient flow can vary depending on the specific nutrient and the plant's physiological needs.\n\nOverall, nutrient aery involves both upward and downward movements of nutrients within plants, with the xylem being responsible for upward transport and the phloem for downward transport.\n\nThe English word is derived from the French tissu, meaning something that is woven, from the verb tisser, \"to weave\".\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, histopathology. For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. In the last couple of decades, developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.\nAnimal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals.\nThe epithelium in all birds and animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the skin, the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina.\nConnective tissues are fibreous tissues. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.\nMuscle cells form the active contractile tissue of the body known as muscle tissue or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism.\nThe epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces such as the surface of skin, the airways, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in secretion, excretion and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.\nEpithelial tissues help in elimination of waste.\nSome epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. they secrete a variety of substance such as sweat,saliva(mucus),enzymes,etc.\nApical Meristem - It is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and root. They form growing parts at the apices of roots and stems and are responsible for increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ.\nLateral Meristem - This meristem consist of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth.\nIntercalary Meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. It is usually present at the base of node, inter node and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode, They result in branch formation and growth.\nMeristemetic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles, they have no inter cellular spaces.\nParenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialised living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. These are generally isodiameteric, in shape. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. In some situations, a parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. Some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted.\nCollenchyma is Greek word where \"Collen\" means gum and \"chyma\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of cellulose, water and pectin substances (pectocellulose) at the corners where number of cells join together. This tissue gives a tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It is absent in monocots and in roots.Sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesis.\nCollenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resist tearing effect of the wind.\nSclerenchyma is Greek word where \"Scleren\" means hard and \"chyma\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is very less i.e. negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of lignin. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as stone cell or sclereids. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. Schlerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long and narrow and unicellular.\nThe entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of epidermis. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells forms a continuous sheet without inter cellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant.\nXylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. It is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt.\nXylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids ends overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\n↑ Bock, Ortwin (2015-01-02). \"A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century\".

Beavers often chose this lidard's tail plant rather than other plants that may thrive within the area. Studies show that in areas where beavers are present, lizard's tail are less likely to be observed.\n\n Beavers are large, semiaquatic rodents in the genus Castor native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. There are two extant species: the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (C. fiber). Beavers are the second-largest living rodents after the capybaras. They have stout bodies with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet and flat, scaly tails. The Eurasian beaver has a more elongated skull with a more triangular nasal bone opening, lighter fur color and a narrower tail. The animals can be found in a number of freshwater habitats, such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. They are herbivorous, consuming \n\n to protect the overall diversity of a landscape. Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity. Biodiversity may also be affected by ecosystem engineer's ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater species richness and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Coral-reef habitats, created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.\n\n The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America and an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands, and is a resource of food and fur for humans. Adult muskrats weigh 0.6 - 2 kg, with a body length of 20 - 35 cm. They are covered with short, thick fur of medium to dark brown color. Their long tails, covered with scales rather than hair, are their main means of propulsion. Muskrats spend most of their time in the water, and can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. They live in families, consisting \n\n which they replace every day. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods and have to be replaced each year. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife \n\nQuestion: Which mammal constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled or semi-natural conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Mariculture, commonly known as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats, opposed to in freshwater aquaculture. Aquaculture can be conducted in completely artificial facilities built on land (onshore aquaculture), as in the case of fish tank, ponds or raceways, where the living conditions rely on human control; on well-sheltered shallow waters nearshore of a body of water (inshore aquaculture), \n\n Not to be confused with seaweed, plant-like algae, or with beachgrass, a terrestrial plant. Seagrasses are the only flowering plants which grow in marine environments. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). Seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants which recolonised the ocean 70 to 100 million years ago. The name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large \"meadows\" resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Most species undergo submarine pollination and complete their life cycle underwater. Seagrasses form dense underwater seagrass meadows which are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They function as important carbon sinks and provide habitats and food for a diversity of marine life comparable to that of coral reefs.\n\n their tissue. Seaweeds are multicellular marine algae and, although their ecological impact is similar to other larger water plants, they are not typically referred to as macrophytes. Aquatic plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water, or at the water's surface. The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is frequently saturated with water. They are therefore a common component of wetlands. One of the largest aquatic plants in the world is the Amazon water lily; one of the smallest is the minute duckweed. Many small aquatic animals use plants such as duckweed for a home, or for protection from predators. Some other familiar examples of aquatic plants might include floating heart, water lily, lotus, and water hyacinth.\n\nA characteristic of large way vegetation is its ability to thrive in moist and low-lying areas. These areas typically have fertile soil and receive ample water supply, either from rainfall or nearby water sources such as rivers or lakes. Large way vegetation includes various types of plants, such as tall grasses, reeds, sedges, and aquatic plants. These plants have adaptations that allow them to withstand the wet conditions, such as their ability to tolerate waterlogged soil and their specialized structures for nutrient uptake. Additionally, large way vegetation plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil, preventing erosion, and providing habitats for a variety of wildlife. It also helps in regulating the water cycle and filtering pollutants from the water. Overall, large way vegetation is characterized by its ability to flourish in wetland environments and fulfill important ecological functions.\n\n  Aquatic plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). They are also referred to as hydrophytes or macrophytes to distinguish them from algae and other microphytes. A macrophyte is a plant that grows in or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or floating. In lakes and rivers macrophytes provide cover for fish, substrate for aquatic invertebrates, produce oxygen, and act as food for some fish and wildlife. Macrophytes are primary producers and are the basis of the food web for many organisms. They have a significant effect on soil chemistry and light levels as they slow down the flow of water and capture pollutants and trap sediments. Excess sediment will settle into the benthos aided by the reduction of flow rates caused by the presence of plant stems, leaves and roots. Some plants have the capability of  absorbing  pollutants \n\nQuestion: What is the generic word for plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position. Completely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms. Partially erupted wisdom teeth can develop cavities or pericoronitis. Removal of impacted wisdom teeth is advised in the case of certain pathologies, such as nonrestorable caries or cysts.\n\nWisdom teeth likely become impacted because of a mismatch between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaw. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. Impacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease. Screening for the presence of wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted. Screening commonly includes a clinical examination as well as x-rays such as panoramic radiographs.\n\nInfection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth can be initially treated with antibiotics, local debridement or surgical removal of the gum overlying the tooth. Over time, most of these treatments tend to fail and patients develop recurrent symptoms. The most common treatment for recurrent pericoronitis is wisdom tooth removal. The risks of wisdom tooth removal are roughly proportional to the difficulty of the extraction. Sometimes, when there is a high risk to the inferior alveolar nerve, only the crown of the tooth will be removed (intentionally leaving the roots) in a procedure called a coronectomy. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. A treatment controversy exists about the need for and timing of the removal of disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. Supporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth. Supporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery.\n\nThe condition affects up to 72% of the Swedish population. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry. It was the meeting of sterile technique, radiology, and anesthesia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that allowed the more routine management of impacted wisdom teeth.\n\nClassification\nAll teeth are classified as either developing, erupted (into the mouth), embedded (failure to erupt despite lack of blockage from another tooth), or impacted.  Impacted teeth are ones that fail to erupt due to blockage from other teeth.  Wisdom teeth, as the last teeth to erupt in the mouth are the most likely to become impacted.  They develop between the ages of 14 and 25, with 50% of root formation completed by age 16, and 95% of all teeth erupted by the age of 25, however, some tooth movement can continue beyond the age of 25.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them. The classification structure helps clinicians estimate the risks for impaction, infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease.\n\nOne review found that 11% of wisdom teeth will have evidence of disease and are symptomatic, 0.6% will be symptomatic but have no disease, 51% will be asymptomatic but have disease present and 37% will be asymptomatic and have no disease.  Impacted wisdom teeth are often described by the direction of their impaction (forward tilting, or mesioangular being the most common), the depth of impaction and the age of the patient as well as other factors such as pre-existing infection or the presence of pathology (cysts, tumors or other disease). Each of these factors is used to predict the difficulty (and rate of complications) when removing an impacted tooth, with age being the most reliable predictor rather than the orientation of the impaction.\n\nAnother classification system often taught in U.S. dental schools is known as Pell and Gregory Classification.  This system includes a horizontal and vertical component to classify the location of third molars (predominately applicable to lower third molars): the third molar's relationship to the level of the teeth already in the mouth, being the vertical or x-component and to the anterior border of the ramus being the horizontal or y-component.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth without communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms. The chances of developing pathology on an impacted wisdom tooth that is not communicating with the mouth is approximately 12%. However,  when impacted wisdom teeth communicate with the mouth, food and bacteria penetrate to the space around the tooth and cause symptoms such as localized pain, swelling and bleeding of the tissue overlying the tooth. The tissue overlying the tooth is called the operculum, and the disorder is called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease.\n\nThe term asymptomatic means that the person has no symptoms. The term asymptomatic should not be equated with absence of disease. Most diseases have no symptoms early in the disease process. A pain-free or asymptomatic tooth can still be infected for many years before pain symptoms develop.\n\nCauses\nWisdom teeth become impacted when there is not enough room in the jaws to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'.\n\nPathophysiology\n\nImpactions completely covered by bone and soft tissue, do not communicate with the mouth, and have a low rate of clinically significant infection.  Since the tooth never erupts, however, the dental follicle that surrounds the tooth does not degenerate during eruption, and can develop cysts or uncommon tumors over time. Estimates of the incidence of cysts or other neoplasms (almost all benign) around impacted teeth average at 3%, usually seen in people under the age of 40. This suggests that the chance of tumor formation decreases with age.\n\nFor partially impacted teeth in those over 20 year of age, the most common pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the impacted tooth. The bacteria associated with infections include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides bacteria. The next most common pathology seen is cavities or tooth decay. Fifteen percent of people with retained wisdom teeth exposed to the mouth have cavities on the wisdom tooth or adjacent second molar due to a wisdom tooth. The rate of cavities on the back of the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age.\n\nIn five percent of cases, advanced periodontitis or gum inflammation between the second and third molars precipitates the removal of wisdom teeth. Among patients with retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth, roughly 25% have gum infections (periodontal disease). Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease. Periodontal probing depths increase over time to greater than 4 mm in a significant proportion of young adults with retained impacted wisdom teeth which is associated with increases in serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and C-reactive protein.\n\nCrowding of the front teeth is not believed to be caused by the eruption of wisdom teeth although this is a reason many dental clinicians use to justify wisdom teeth extraction.,\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of impaction can be made clinically if enough of the wisdom tooth is visible to determine its angulation, depth, and if the patient is old enough that further eruption or uprighting is unlikely. Wisdom teeth continue to move to the age of 25 years old due to eruption, and then continue some later movement owing to periodontal disease.\n\nIf the tooth cannot be assessed with clinical exam alone, the diagnosis is made using either a panoramic radiograph or cone-beam CT. Where unerupted wisdom teeth still have eruption potential several predictors are used to determine the chance of the teeth becoming impacted. The ratio of space between the tooth crown length and the amount of space available, the angle of the teeth compared to the other teeth are the two most commonly used predictors, with the space ratio being the most accurate. Despite the capacity for movement into early adulthood, the likelihood that the tooth will become impacted can be predicted when the ratio of space available to the length of the crown of the tooth is under 1.\n\nScreening\n\nThere is no standard to screen for wisdom teeth. It has been suggested, absent evidence to support routinely retaining or removing wisdom teeth, that evaluation with panoramic radiograph, starting between the ages of 16 and 25 be completed every 3 years. Once there is the possibility of the teeth developing disease, then a discussion about the operative risks versus long-term risk of retention with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or other clinician trained to evaluate wisdom teeth is recommended. These recommendations are based on expert opinion level evidence. Screening at a younger age may be required if the second molars (the \"12-year molars\") fail to erupt as ectopic positioning of the wisdom teeth can prevent their eruption. Radiographs can be avoided if the majority of the tooth is visible in the mouth.\n\nTreatment\nWisdom teeth that are fully erupted and in normal function need no special attention and should be treated just like any other tooth. It is more challenging, however to make treatment decisions with asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth where there is a high probability that the teeth will develop disease over time, but none exists on examination, or on x-rays (see Treatment controversy below).\n\nLocal treatment\n\nPericoronitis is an infection of the operculum of a partially impacted wisdom tooth.  It can be treated with local cleaning, an antiseptic rinse of the area and antibiotics if severe. Definitive treatment can be excision of the operculum, however, recurrence of these infections is high. Pericoronitis, while a small area of tissue, should be viewed with caution, because it lies near the anatomic planes of the neck and can progress to life-threatening neck infections.\n\nWisdom teeth removal\nWisdom teeth removal (extraction) is the most common treatment for impacted wisdom teeth. In the US, 10 million wisdom teeth are removed annually. The procedure can be either simple or surgical, depending on the depth of the impaction and angle of the tooth. Surgical removal is to create an incision in the mucosa of the mouth, remove bone of the mandible or maxilla adjacent the tooth, extract it or possibly section the tooth and extract it in pieces. This can be completed under local anaesthetic, sedation or general anaesthetic. As of 2020, the evidence is insufficient to recommend one type of surgical practice over another.\n\nRecovery, risks and complications\nMost people will experience pain and swelling (worst on the first post-operative day) then return to work after 2 to 3 days with the rate of discomfort decreased to about 25% by post-operative day 7 unless affected by dry socket: a disorder of wound healing that prolongs post-operative pain. It can be 4 to 6 weeks before patients are fully recovered with a full range of jaw movements.\n\nA Cochrane investigation found that the use of antibiotics either just before or just after surgery reduced the risk of infection, pain and dry socket after wisdom teeth are removed by oral surgeons, but that using antibiotics also causes more side effects for these patients. Nineteen patients needed to receive antibiotics to prevent one infection. The conclusion of the review was that antibiotics given to healthy people to prevent infections may cause more harm than benefit to both the individual patients and the population as a whole. Another Cochrane Investigation has found post-operative pain is effectively managed with either ibuprofen, or ibuprofen in combination with acetaminophen.\n\nLong-term complications can include periodontal complications such as bone loss on the second molar following wisdom teeth removal. Bone loss as a complication after wisdom teeth removal is uncommon in the young but present in 43% of those of 25 years of age or older. Injury to the inferior alveolar nerve resulting in numbness or partial numbness of the lower lip and chin has reported rates that vary widely from 0.04% to 5%. The largest study is from a survey of 535 oral and maxillofacial surgeons in California, where a rate of 1:2,500 was reported.\n\nThe large variation in report rates is attributed to variations in technique, the patient pool and surgeon experience. Other complications that are uncommon have been reported including persistent sinus communication, damage to adjacent teeth, lingual nerve injury, displaced teeth, osteomyelitis and jaw fracture. Alveolar osteitis, post-operative infection, excessive bleeding may also be expected.\n\nTreatment controversy\n\nMany impacted wisdom teeth are extracted prior to the age of 25, when full eruption can be reasonably expected and before symptoms or disease have begun. This has led to a treatment controversy generally referred to as the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth.\n\nIn 2000, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom set guidelines to discontinue the removal of asymptomatic disease-free third molars in the UK National Health Service, stating that there was no reliable research evidence to support a health benefit to patients from the prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molar teeth, in addition to the risks of removal and cost to the service. Advocates of the policy point out that the impacted wisdom teeth can be monitored and avoidance of surgery also means avoidance of the recovery, risks, complications and costs associated with it. Following implementation of the NICE guidelines the UK saw a decrease in the number of impacted third molar operations between 2000 and 2006 and a rise in the average age at extraction from 25 to 31 years. The American Public Health Association (APHA) has adopted a similar policy.\n\nThose who argue against a blanket moratorium on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars and that there are costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point to the fact that there is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.\n\nAlthough most studies arrive at the conclusion of negative long-term outcomes e.g. increased pocketing and attachment loss after surgery, it is clear that early removal (before 25 years old), good post-operative hygiene and plaque control, and lack of pre-existing periodontal pathology before surgery are the most crucial factors that minimise the probability of adverse post-surgical outcomes.\n\nThe Cochrane review of surgical removal versus retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth suggests that the presence of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting adjacent 2nd molar (measured by distal probing depth > 4 mm on that tooth) in the long term.  Few studies, however, met the criteria to be included in the Cochrane review and those that were included provided very low quality evidence and had a high risk of bias. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the dental arch. There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom teeth.\n\nOne trial in adolescents who had orthodontic treatment comparing the removal of impacted lower wisdom teeth with retention was identified. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. The authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to support either the routine removal or retention of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association.\n\nDue to the lack of sufficient evidence to determine whether such teeth should be removed or not, the patient's preference and values should be taken into account with clinical expertise exercised and careful consideration of risks and benefits to determine treatment. If it is decided to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection).\n\nCoronectomy\n\nCoronectomy is a procedure where the crown of the impacted wisdom tooth is removed, but the roots are intentionally left in place. It is indicated when there is no disease of the dental pulp or infection around the crown of the tooth, and there is a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury.\n\nCoronectomy, while lessening the immediate risk to the inferior alveolar nerve function has its own complication rates and can result in repeated surgeries. Between 2.3% and 38.3% of roots loosen during the procedure and need to be removed and up to 4.9% of cases require reoperation due to persistent pain, root exposure or persistent infection. The roots have also been reported to migrate in 13.2% to 85.9% of cases.\n\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for impacted wisdom teeth depends on the depth of the impaction. When they lack a communication to the mouth, the main risk is the chance of a cyst or neoplasm forming in the tissues around the tooth (such as the dental follicle), which is relatively uncommon.\n\nOnce communicating with the mouth, the onset of disease or symptoms cannot be predicted but the chance of it does increase with age. Less than 2% of wisdom teeth are free of either periodontal disease or caries by age 65. Further, several studies have found that between 30% – 60% of people with previously asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth will have them extracted due to symptoms or disease, 4–12 years after initial examination.\n\nExtraction of the wisdom teeth removes the disease on the wisdom tooth itself and also appears to improve the periodontal status of the second molar, although this benefit diminishes beyond the age of 25.\n\nEpidemiology\nFew studies have looked at the percentage of the time wisdom teeth are present or the rate of wisdom teeth eruption. The lack of up to five teeth (excluding third molars, i.e. wisdom teeth) is termed hypodontia. Missing third molars occur in 9-30% of studied populations. One large scale study on a group of young adults in New Zealand showed 95.6% had at least 1 wisdom tooth with an eruption rate of 15% in the maxilla and 20% in the mandible. Another study on 5000 army recruits found 10,767 impacted wisdom teeth. The frequency of impacted lower third molars was found to be 72% in a Swedish study, and the frequency of retained impacted wisdom teeth that are free of disease and symptoms is estimated to be between 11.6% to 29%, a percentage which drops with age.\n\nThe incidence of wisdom tooth removal was estimated to be 4 per 1000 person years in England and Wales prior to the 2000 NICE guidelines.\n\nHistory\n\nWisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates. \"Teeth of wisdom\" being from the Latin, dentes sapientiæ, which in turn is derived from the Hippocratic term, sophronisteres, from the Greek sophron, meaning prudent.\n\nCharles Darwin believed the wisdom teeth to be in decline with evolution, a theory which his contemporary, Paolo Mantegazza, later proved to be false when he discovered Darwin was not opening the jawbones of specimens to find the impacted tooth stuck in the jaw.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the collision of sterile technique, anaesthesia and radiology made routine surgery on the wisdom teeth possible. John Tomes's 1873 text A System of Dental Surgery describes techniques for removal of \"third molars, or dentes sapientiæ\" including descriptions of inferior alveolar nerve injury, jaw fracture and pupil dilation after opium is placed in the socket. Other texts from about this time speculate on their de-evolution, that they are prone to decay and discussion on whether or not they lead to crowding of the other teeth.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nOral surgery\nArticles containing video clips\nAcquired tooth pathology\n\n Hypodontia is defined as the developmental absence of one or more teeth excluding the third molars. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. It usually occurs as part of a syndrome that involves other abnormalities and requires multidisciplinary treatment. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Hypodontia: one to six missing teeth excluding the third molars 2. Oligodontia: six or more missing permanent teeth excluding the third molars 3. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth\n\nAn overview by India Dental Clinic and listing information of wisdom teeth removal treatment surgery centers in India and maxillofacial dental surgery hospitals performing impacted wisdom tooth extractions in India. Affordable cost of wisdom teeth pulling surgery in India encourages patients to go in for tooth extraction treatment. A fully grown up adult will have 32 teeth in mouth, 8 teeth in each quarter of a mouth. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. They typically emerge between the ages of 17 and 25 – the so-called “age of wisdom.” Often they need to be removed and because of their position they can present unique problems both before and after surgery. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. They often have a piece of gum over the back part of their biting surface; this makes them vulnerable to infection (pericoronitis). Lower wisdom teeth are very commonly infected. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath.\nSince wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. This may also cause malocclusion. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). When a wisdom tooth is impacted, it usually must be removed (extracted). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. However, many patients do experience symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. There are other more unusual reasons why wisdom teeth are removed in hospitals such as cysts, tumours, and fractures of the jaw in this region.\nThe listed dentists of India Dental Clinic would rather first adopt a conservative dental treatment approach of just monitoring the eruption progress of wisdom teeth of both upper and lower jaw. A new school of thought is not remove wisdom teeth unless impacted. Many dentists believe that impacted wisdom teeth are almost certain to cause problems at some point, and recommend surgical extraction regardless of whether or not the patient is experiencing symptoms. Dentists typically prefer to remove wisdom teeth when the patient is between the ages of 16 and 21, before the tooth roots become implanted in the jawbone.\nSuch grown up adults who did not get the wisdom teeth extraction done during adolescence may also have them removed. Extraction usually takes between five and 30 minutes. In cases of more serious impaction, an oral surgeon may have to perform the extraction. Upper wisdom teeth are usually very straightforward to remove unless badly decayed. Lower wisdom teeth are often removed under a local anaesthetic with or without sedation. After the area is numbed, gently cutting the gum and moving it to one side exposes the tooth. Some teeth require a little piece of bone to be removed and this is done with a drill. Just as when a filling is done the drill requires water irrigation and so the nurse will suction around the wound to enable the dentist to see the tooth. Sometimes the tooth will be cut into pieces to aid its removal. Following the removal the wound is washed and the gum stitched into place. The dentist may use dissolvable stitches. Some dentists prefer to use non-dissolving stitches and will make an appointment to remove them, usually between 1 and 2 weeks later. If they do need to be removed then this is usually straightforward and painless.\nMaxillary Sinus Trauma: Some times one encounter rare complications like the sinus floor and associated membrane get perforated. This causes a small amount of blood to collect in the sinus that will drain from the patient’s nose or pass into the back of the mouth. It is neither serious nor poses any threat to the patient. Simply wipe it from your nose or gargle warm water in your throat to clear the blood. However, there are rare instances when a sinus perforation will not heal and a fistula develops that represents a communication between your mouth and sinus cavity. An open fistula can lead to fluid and debris getting into your sinus through the opening and draining from your nose. If we feel you are risk of developing a fistula after your surgery, we will make every effort to repair the area at the time of surgery. After surgery, we ask you to not “blow” your nose and if it is necessary to sneeze, you should sneeze with your mouth open but covered to prevent excessive pressure from developing within the sinus. If a fistula does develop after surgery in spite of best efforts by the surgeon, please be aware that most fistulas resolve spontaneously but please call dentist for instructions. Rarely is a second surgery necessary to close the fistula.\nFistula develops early on as a birth defect (associated with a cleft palate). An oromaxillary fistula is an abnormal passageway between one of the sinuses on either side of your nose (maxillary sinuses) and the roof of your mouth. It is also faced as a complication of removing a tooth, or from infection or trauma. Sometimes the roots of a tooth are so close to the bone under a maxillary sinus that the bone is damaged when the tooth is removed. This can open a passage between the mouth and sinus. It is for this reason a CT scan is advised by dental clinics in India before the surgery is planned.\nIn the cases of difficult lower wisdom teeth extractions most dentists would prescribe antibiotics in order to avoid any potential infection. There are many ways in which the patient can help the wound to heal. The medication prescribed should be taken in the manner directed. Most patients find that any pain is easily treated by painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (assuming that there are no reasons why they may not take this medication e.g. stomach ulcer). However if the pain becomes severe then it may be that a dry socket is developing. A return to the dentist will be necessary. Dry socket is a painful condition that occurs when the socket’s blood clot dislodges and the underlying bone becomes exposed. It can be prevented by closely following post-extraction instructions (e.g., no smoking or alcohol). The pain is deep seated and described as throbbing. Risk factors include difficult extractions, smokers, poor oral hygiene and ladies on the oral contraceptive pill. There is no way to prevent the problems associated with a wisdom tooth. Hot salt water mouth rinses should be used regularly for 5 minutes 4 times a day for a week. The water should be tepid but not too hot as to burn. A tablespoon full of salt should be allowed to dissolve in a coffee mug sized amount of this water. The mouthwash is then held over the wisdom teeth socket until it is cooled and then spat out. However, careful oral hygiene such as regular brushing and flossing can help reduce the risk of tooth decay, infection or other complications. Additional specific advice as per your situation would be provided by India Dental Clinic.\n\n Typically, all baby teeth will be present by the age of three. As for all adult teeth, they erupt between the ages 6 to 14, with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age. If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken.\n\nYour third molars, commonly known as your wisdom teeth, are typically the last teeth to erupt in your mouth. If healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful. However, there are also reasons behind why you may need to consider removing your wisdom teeth. In some cases your wisdom teeth are in fact healthy, but because of orthodontic treatment they need to be removed.\nIn other cases, your wisdom teeth can become impacted or only partially erupt through the gum in a misalignment. When impacted or partially impacted, your wisdom teeth can cause swelling, pain and even infection of the surrounding gum. They can also put pressure on the adjacent teeth, which can result in permanent damage to these otherwise healthy teeth and their surrounding bone. Sometimes, impacted or partially impacted wisdom teeth can also lead to the formation of cysts, and in worse case scenarios even tumors, which could potentially destroy an entire section of your jaw.\nLastly a fully erupted wisdom tooth needs to be removed because they are very hard to clean and can become severely decayed. So for these reasons sometimes the smart move is to have your wisdom teeth removed.\nWhether your dentist or a specialist is performing the extraction the procedure is the same. First, a local anesthetic is given to make the procedure more comfortable. In some cases your doctor may elect to administer nitrous oxide gas in addition to the anesthetic or use a general anesthetic to put you under entirely.\nOnce the area is numb, the extraction begins. A dental instrument called an elevator is used to wiggle the tooth in its socket. After the tooth is loosened it is removed using forceps or in some more complicated cases a surgical hand piece is also used to assist with the removal of the tooth.\nWhen Should I Remove My Wisdom Tooth?\nWhen should you have your wisdom teeth removed? There is no single right answer for everyone; however, if your dentist has advised you that your wisdom teeth look potentially problematic it’s generally best to remove them sooner rather than later.\nThis advice is based on the fact that the younger you are, the faster you heal. The likeliness of lingering numbness, jaw fracture or other complications also increases with age. Lastly, the longer you leave a troublesome wisdom tooth in your mouth, the longer it has to cause further problems in the future.\n\nQuestion: Which teeth are the third molars, and are always the last to0 erupt?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to a meal.\n\n The insulin concentration in blood increases after meals and gradually returns to basal levels during the next 1–2 hours. However, the basal insulin level is not stable. It oscillates with a regular period of 3-6 min. After a meal the amplitude of these oscillations increases but the periodicity remains constant. The oscillations are believed to be important for insulin sensitivity by preventing downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells. Such downregulation underlies insulin resistance, which is common in type 2 diabetes. It would therefore be advantageous to administer insulin to diabetic patients in a manner mimicking the natural oscillations. The insulin oscillations are generated by pulsatile release of the hormone from the pancreas. Insulin originates from beta cells located in the islets of Langerhans. Since each islet contains up to 2000 beta cells and there are one million islets in the pancreas it is apparent that pulsatile secretion requires sophisticated synchronization both within and among the islets of Langerhans. \n\n Baseline levels of insulin do not signal muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose. When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Blood sugar will then rapidly drop. This can progress to type 2 diabetes. Sleep loss can affect the basic metabolic functions of storing carbohydrates and regulating hormones. Reduction of sleep from eight hours to four hours produces changes in glucose tolerance and endocrine function. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center followed 11 healthy young men for 16 consecutive nights. The first 3 nights, the young men slept for the normal 8 hours. The next 6 nights, they slept for 4 hours. The next 7 nights, they spent 12 hours in bed. They all had the same diet. They found that there were changes \n\nBlood sugar regulation is the process by which the levels of blood sugar, primarily glucose, are maintained by the body within a narrow range. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood.\n\nMechanisms\n\nBlood sugar levels are regulated by negative feedback in order to keep the body in balance. The levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important.\n\nGranule docking is an important glucose-dependent step in human insulin secretion that does not work properly in type 2 diabetes.\n\nGlucagon\nIf the blood glucose level falls to dangerously low levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon, a hormone which travels through the blood to  the liver, where it binds to glucagon receptors on the surface of liver cells and stimulates them to break down glycogen stored inside the cells into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis).  The cells release the glucose into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemia, the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of dextrose or carbohydrate foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.\n\nInsulin\nWhen levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of glycogen conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called glycogenesis), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into glucose-6-phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell. Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulator of metabolic control in humans.\n\nThere are also several other causes for an increase in blood sugar levels. Among them are the 'stress' hormones such as epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body (insulin resistance). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood (hyperglycemia) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n\nHormones that influence blood glucose level\n\nReferences \n\nDiabetes\nMedical conditions related to obesity\nNutrition\nEndocrinology\n\nBlood sugar levels are regulated through a process called glucose homeostasis, which refers to the body's ability to maintain blood glucose within a narrow range. This regulation involves various hormones, including insulin and glucagon, which are predominantly secreted by the pancreas. The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood.\n\nInsulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin enables the uptake of glucose by cells throughout the body, particularly in muscle and adipose tissue. It promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles, and also enhances the conversion of glucose into fatty acids for storage.\n\nOn the other hand, glucagon, which is released by alpha cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect of raising blood sugar levels. If blood glucose falls dangerously low, as in situations of prolonged fasting or intense exercise, glucagon is released. It binds to receptors on liver cells and stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which is released back into the bloodstream, elevating blood sugar levels. In more severe cases of low blood sugar, glucagon can be administered through injection or infusion to restore glucose levels.\n\nThe regulation of blood sugar levels is maintained through negative feedback mechanisms. Many tissues monitor the levels of glucose in the blood, but pancreatic islet cells are particularly important in this process. When blood glucose levels deviate from the desired range, the pancreas adjusts insulin and glucagon secretion accordingly to restore balance.\n\nIn summary, blood sugar levels are regulated through a complex interplay of hormones, primarily insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas. Insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose, while glucagon stimulates the release of stored glucose. This delicate balance ensures that blood glucose levels remain within a narrow range, thus maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body.\n\nReference:\n- Blood sugar regulation is the process by which the levels of blood sugar, primarily glucose, are maintained by the body within a narrow range.

The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.\n\nIn humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.\n\nThe heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.\n\nStructure\n\nLocation and shape\n\nThe human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels—the venae cavae, aorta and pulmonary trunk. The upper part of the heart is located at the level of the third costal cartilage. The lower tip of the heart, the apex, lies to the left of the sternum (8 to 9 cm from the midsternal line) between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages.\n\nThe largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest (though occasionally it may be offset to the right) and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body parts. Because the heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart.\nThe heart is cone-shaped, with its base positioned upwards and tapering down to the apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.\n\nChambers\n\nThe heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.\n\nThe fibrous cardiac skeleton gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum, which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings, which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.\n\nValves\n\nThe heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle.\n\nThe valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It is also known as the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.\n\nThe papillary muscles extend from the walls of the heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria. \n\nTwo additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.\n\nRight heart\n\nThe right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve.\n\nThe right atrium receives blood almost continuously from the body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A small amount of blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.\n\nThe right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. The right ventricle tapers into the pulmonary trunk, into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.\n\nLeft heart\n\nThe left heart has two chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle, separated by the mitral valve.\n\nThe left atrium receives oxygenated blood back from the lungs via one of the four pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.\n\nThe left ventricle is much thicker as compared with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart muscle; the left coronary artery is above the left cusp of the valve,  and the right coronary artery is above the right cusp.\n\nWall\n\nThe heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.\n\nThe innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium. It is made up of a lining of simple squamous epithelium and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.\n\nThe middle layer of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle—a layer of involuntary striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels and the inner muscles, forming a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceeding toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.\n\nThere are two types of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to contract easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate—spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.\n\nThere are specific proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin. They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 that are also expressed in skeletal muscle.\n\nPericardium \nThe pericardium is the sac that surrounds the heart. The tough outer surface of the pericardium is called the fibrous membrane. This is lined by a double inner membrane called the serous membrane that produces pericardial fluid to lubricate the surface of the heart. The part of the serous membrane attached to the fibrous membrane is called the parietal pericardium, while the part of the serous membrane attached to the heart is known as the visceral pericardium. The pericardium is present in order to lubricate its movement against other structures within the chest, to keep the heart's position stabilised within the chest, and to protect the heart from infection.\n\nCoronary circulation\n\nHeart tissue, like all cells in the body, needs to be supplied with oxygen, nutrients and a way of removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.\n\nHeart tissue receives blood from two arteries which arise just above the aortic valve. These are the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery. The left main coronary artery splits shortly after leaving the aorta into two vessels, the left anterior descending and the left circumflex artery. The left anterior descending artery supplies heart tissue and the front, outer side, and septum of the left ventricle. It does this by branching into smaller arteries—diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, and lower posterior sections of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery also supplies blood to the atrioventricular node (in about 90% of people) and the sinoatrial node (in about 60% of people). The right coronary artery runs in a groove at the back of the heart and the left anterior descending artery runs in a groove at the front. There is significant variation between people in the anatomy of the arteries that supply the heart  The arteries divide at their furthest reaches into smaller branches that join together at the edges of each arterial distribution.\n\nThe coronary sinus is a large vein that drains into the right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining the back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.\n\nSmall lymphatic networks called plexuses exist beneath each of the three layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.\n\nNerve supply\n\nThe heart receives nerve signals from the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.\n\nThe vagus nerve is a long, wandering nerve that emerges from the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to a large number of organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, as well as to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. This early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development.\n\nThe heart derives from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the cardiogenic region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse to form a primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between the third and fourth week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the formation of the septa and the valves and the remodeling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week, the septa are complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves are complete.\n\nBefore the fifth week, there is an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale was, called the fossa ovalis.\n\nThe embryonic heart begins beating at around 22 days after conception (5 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth.\n\nPhysiology\n\nBlood flow\n\nThe heart functions as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation to and from the body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.\n\nThe right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects in the right and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.\n\nIn the left heart, oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.\n\nCardiac cycle\n\nThe cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat. The period of time during which the ventricles contract, forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery, is known as systole, while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as diastole. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.\n\nAt the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the ventricles are relaxing. As they do so, they are filled by blood passing through the open mitral and tricuspid valves. After the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria contract, forcing further blood into the ventricles and priming the pump. Next, the ventricles start to contract. As the pressure rises within the cavities of the ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valves are forced shut. As the pressure within the ventricles rises further, exceeding the pressure with the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open. Blood is ejected from the heart, causing the pressure within the ventricles to fall. Simultaneously, the atria refill as blood flows into the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Finally, when the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The ventricles start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the cycle begins again.\n\nCardiac output\n\nCardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle (stroke volume) in one minute. This is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume (SV) by the beats per minute of the heart rate (HR). So that: CO = SV x HR.\nThe cardiac output is normalized to body size through body surface area and is called the cardiac index.\n\nThe average cardiac output, using an average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, with a normal range of 4.0–8.0 L/min. The stroke volume is normally measured using an echocardiogram and can be influenced by the size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload and afterload.\n\nPreload refers to the filling pressure of the atria at the end of diastole, when the ventricles are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill: if the ventricles contract more frequently, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.\n\nAfterload, or how much pressure the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.\n\nThe strength of heart muscle contractions controls the stroke volume. This can be influenced positively or negatively by agents termed inotropes. These agents can be a result of changes within the body, or be given as drugs as part of treatment for a medical disorder, or as a form of life support, particularly in intensive care units. Inotropes that increase the force of contraction are \"positive\" inotropes, and include sympathetic agents such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. \"Negative\" inotropes decrease the force of contraction and include calcium channel blockers.\n\nElectrical conduction\n\nThe normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is established by the heart's own pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (also known as the sinus node or the SA node). Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract. The sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.\n\nHeart rate\n\nThe normal resting heart rate is called the sinus rhythm, created and sustained by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in the wall of the right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes into and out of the pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.\n\nWhen the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium start to move out of and into the cell only once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.\n\nThe ions move from areas where they are concentrated to where they are not. For this reason sodium moves into the cell from outside, and potassium moves from within the cell to outside the cell. Calcium also plays a critical role. Their influx through slow channels means that the sinoatrial cells have a prolonged \"plateau\" phase when they have a positive charge. A part of this is called the absolute refractory period. Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin C in the troponin complex to enable contraction of the cardiac muscle, and separate from the protein to allow relaxation.\n\nThe adult resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 bpm. The resting heart rate of a newborn can be 129 beats per minute (bpm) and this gradually decreases until maturity. An athlete's heart rate can be lower than 60 bpm. During exercise the rate can be 150 bpm with maximum rates reaching from 200 to 220 bpm.\n\nInfluences\nThe normal sinus rhythm of the heart, giving the resting heart rate, is influenced by a number of factors. The cardiovascular centres in the brainstem control the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences to the heart through the vagus nerve and sympathetic trunk. These cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of receptors including baroreceptors, sensing stretch the stretching of blood vessels and chemoreceptors, sensing the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and its pH. Through a series of reflexes these help regulate and sustain blood flow.\n\nBaroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.\n\nExercise and fitness levels, age, body temperature, basal metabolic rate, and even a person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.\n\nClinical significance\n\nDiseases\n\nCardiovascular diseases, which include diseases of the heart, are the leading cause of death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors, cardiothoracic surgeons, intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.\n\nIschaemic heart disease \n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as ischaemic heart disease, is caused by atherosclerosis—a build-up of fatty material along the inner walls of the arteries. These fatty deposits known as atherosclerotic plaques narrow the coronary arteries, and if severe may reduce blood flow to the heart. If a narrowing (or stenosis) is relatively minor then the patient may not experience any symptoms. Severe narrowings may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or even at rest. The thin covering of an atherosclerotic plaque can rupture, exposing the fatty centre to the circulating blood. In this case a clot or thrombus can form, blocking the artery, and restricting blood flow to an area of heart muscle causing a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) or unstable angina. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.\n\nHeart failure \n\nHeart failure is defined as a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the demands of the body. Patients with heart failure may experience breathlessness especially when lying flat, as well as ankle swelling, known as peripheral oedema. Heart failure is the end result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with ischaemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or high blood pressure. Less common causes include various cardiomyopathies. Heart failure is frequently associated with weakness of the heart muscle in the ventricles (systolic heart failure), but can also be seen in patients with heart muscle that is strong but stiff (diastolic heart failure). The condition may affect the left ventricle (causing predominantly breathlessness), the right ventricle (causing predominantly swelling of the legs and an elevated jugular venous pressure), or both ventricles. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias.\n\nCardiomyopathies \nCardiomyopathies are diseases affecting the muscle of the heart. Some cause abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart to abnormally expand and weaken (dilated cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart muscle to become stiff and unable to fully relax between contractions (restrictive cardiomyopathy) and some make the heart prone to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy). These conditions are often genetic and can be inherited, but some such as dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by damage from toxins such as alcohol. Some cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomopathy are linked to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in athletes. Many cardiomyopathies can lead to heart failure in the later stages of the disease.\n\nValvular heart disease \nHealthy heart valves allow blood to flow easily in one direction, but prevent it from flowing in the other direction. Diseased heart valves may have a narrow opening and therefore restrict the flow of blood in the forward direction (referred to as a stenotic valve), or may allow blood to leak in the reverse direction (referred to as valvular regurgitation). Valvular heart disease may cause breathlessness, blackouts, or chest pain, but may be asymptomatic and only detected on a routine examination by hearing abnormal heart sounds or a heart murmur. In the developed world, valvular heart disease is most commonly caused by degeneration secondary to old age, but may also be caused by infection of the heart valves (endocarditis). In some parts of the world rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of valvular heart disease, typically leading to mitral or aortic stenosis and caused by the body's immune system reacting to a streptococcal throat infection.\n\nCardiac arrhythmias \n\nWhile in the healthy heart, waves of electrical impulses originate in the sinus node before spreading to the rest of the atria, the atrioventricular node, and finally the ventricles (referred to as a normal sinus rhythm), this normal rhythm can be disrupted. Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias may be asymptomatic or may cause palpitations, blackouts, or breathlessness. Some types of arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation increase the long term risk of stroke.\n\nSome arrhythmias cause the heart to beat abnormally slowly, referred to as a bradycardia or bradyarrhythmia. This may be caused by an abnormally slow sinus node or damage within the cardiac conduction system (heart block). In other arrhythmias the heart may beat abnormally rapidly, referred to as a tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia. These arrhythmias can take many forms and can originate from different structures within the heart—some arise from the atria (e.g. atrial flutter), some from the atrioventricular node (e.g. AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia) whilst others arise from the ventricles (e.g. ventricular tachycardia). Some tachyarrhythmias are caused by scarring within the heart (e.g. some forms of ventricular tachycardia), others by an irritable focus (e.g. focal atrial tachycardia), while others are caused by additional abnormal conduction tissue that has been present since birth (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The most dangerous form of heart racing is ventricular fibrillation, in which the ventricles quiver rather than contract, and which if untreated is rapidly fatal.\n\nPericardial disease \nThe sac which surrounds the heart, called the pericardium, can become inflamed in a condition known as pericarditis. This condition typically causes chest pain that may spread to the back, and is often caused by a viral infection (glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, or coxsackievirus). Fluid can build up within the pericardial sac, referred to as a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to pericarditis, kidney failure, or tumours, and frequently do not cause any symptoms. However, large effusions or effusions which accumulate rapidly can compress the heart in a condition known as cardiac tamponade, causing breathlessness and potentially fatal low blood pressure. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.\n\nCongenital heart disease \n\nSome people are born with hearts that are abnormal and these abnormalities are known as congenital heart defects. They may range from the relatively minor (e.g. patent foramen ovale, arguably a variant of normal) to serious life-threatening abnormalities (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Common abnormalities include those that affect the heart muscle that separates the two side of the heart (a \"hole in the heart\" - e.g., ventricular septal defect). Other defects include those affecting the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis), or the main blood vessels that lead from the heart (e.g. coarctation of the aorta). More complex syndromes are seen that affect more than one part of the heart (e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot).\n\nSome congenital heart defects allow blood that is low in oxygen that would normally be returned to the lungs to instead be pumped back to the rest of the body. These are known as cyanotic congenital heart defects and are often more serious. Major congenital heart defects are often picked up in childhood, shortly after birth, or even before a child is born (e.g. transposition of the great arteries), causing breathlessness and a lower rate of growth. More minor forms of congenital heart disease may remain undetected for many years and only reveal themselves in adult life (e.g., atrial septal defect).\n\nDiagnosis\nHeart disease is diagnosed by the taking of a medical history, a cardiac examination, and further investigations, including blood tests, echocardiograms, ECGs and imaging. Other invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterisation can also play a role.\n\nExamination\n\nThe cardiac examination includes inspection, feeling the chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs that may be visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, in order to assess for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope.\n\nHeart sounds\n\nTypically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as \"lub\". The second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as \"dub\". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.\n\nHeart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds which can be either related to disease or benign, and there are several kinds. There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or \"murmurs\" related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the cardiac cycle, and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person's position, the frequency of the sound as determined by the side of the stethoscope by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest. Murmurs may be caused by damaged heart valves or congenital heart disease such as ventricular septal defects, or may be heard in normal hearts. A different type of sound, a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together.\n\nBlood tests\nBlood tests play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions.\n\nTroponin is a sensitive biomarker for a heart with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken—one at the time of initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.\n\nOther blood tests are often taken to help understand a person's general health and risk factors that may contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required to ensure that the right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.\n\nElectrocardiogram\n\nUsing surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the electrical activity of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG) or (EKG). An ECG is a bedside test and involves the placement of ten leads on the body. This produces a \"12 lead\" ECG (three extra leads are calculated mathematically, and one lead is electrically ground (earthed)).\n\nThere are five prominent features on the ECG: the  P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge (\"depolarising\") in the direction of that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative (\"repolarising\") in the direction of the lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.\n\nImaging\n\nSeveral imaging methods can be used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT, MRI, and PET, scans. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest (transthoracic), or by a probe in the esophagus (transesophageal). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.\n\nCT scans, chest X-rays and other forms of imaging can help evaluate the heart's size, evaluate for signs of pulmonary oedema, and indicate whether there is fluid around the heart. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart.\n\nTreatment\nDiseases affecting the heart can be treated by a variety of methods including lifestyle modification, drug treatment, and surgery.\n\nIschaemic heart disease\nNarrowings of the coronary arteries (ischaemic heart disease) are treated to relieve symptoms of chest pain caused by a partially narrowed artery (angina pectoris), to minimise heart muscle damage when an artery is completely occluded (myocardial infarction), or to prevent a myocardial infarction from occurring. Medications to improve angina symptoms include nitroglycerin, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers, while preventative treatments include antiplatelets such as aspirin and statins, lifestyle measures such as stopping smoking and weight loss, and treatment of risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nIn addition to using medications, narrowed heart arteries can be treated by expanding the narrowings or redirecting the flow of blood to bypass an obstruction. This may be performed using a percutaneous coronary intervention, during which narrowings can be expanded by passing small balloon-tipped wires into the coronary arteries, inflating the balloon to expand the narrowing, and sometimes leaving behind a metal scaffold known as a stent to keep the artery open.\n\nIf the narrowings in coronary arteries are unsuitable for treatment with a percutaneous coronary intervention, open surgery may be required. A coronary artery bypass graft can be performed, whereby a blood vessel from another part of the body (the saphenous vein, radial artery, or internal mammary artery) is used to redirect blood from a point before the narrowing (typically the aorta) to a point beyond the obstruction.\n\nValvular heart disease \nDiseased heart valves that have become abnormally narrow or abnormally leaky may require surgery. This is traditionally performed as an open surgical procedure to replace the damaged heart valve with a tissue or metallic prosthetic valve. In some circumstances, the tricuspid or mitral valves can be repaired surgically, avoiding the need for a valve replacement. Heart valves can also be treated percutaneously, using techniques that share many similarities with percutaneous coronary intervention. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is increasingly used for patients consider very high risk for open valve replacement.\n\nCardiac arrhythmias \nAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can be treated using antiarrhythmic drugs. These may work by manipulating the flow of electrolytes across the cell membrane (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers, amiodarone, or digoxin), or modify the autonomic nervous system's effect on the heart (beta blockers and atropine). In some arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation which increase the risk of stroke, this risk can be reduced using anticoagulants such as warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants.\n\nIf medications fail to control an arrhythmia, another treatment option may be catheter ablation. In these procedures, wires are passed from a vein or artery in the leg to the heart to find the abnormal area of tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. The abnormal tissue can be intentionally damaged, or ablated, by heating or freezing to prevent further heart rhythm disturbances. Whilst the majority of arrhythmias can be treated using minimally invasive catheter techniques, some arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation) can also be treated using open or thoracoscopic surgery, either at the time of other cardiac surgery or as a standalone procedure. A cardioversion, whereby an electric shock is used to stun the heart out of an abnormal rhythm, may also be used.\n\nCardiac devices in the form of pacemakers or implantable defibrillators may also be required to treat arrhythmias. Pacemakers, comprising a small battery powered generator implanted under the skin and one or more leads that extend to the heart, are most commonly used to treat abnormally slow heart rhythms. Implantable defibrillators are used to treat serious life-threatening rapid heart rhythms. These devices monitor the heart, and if dangerous heart racing is detected can automatically deliver a shock to restore the heart to a normal rhythm. Implantable defibrillators are most commonly used in patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathies, or inherited arrhythmia syndromes.\n\nHeart failure \nAs well as addressing the underlying cause for a patient's heart failure (most commonly ischaemic heart disease or hypertension), the mainstay of heart failure treatment is with medication. These include drugs to prevent fluid from accumulating in the lungs by increasing the amount of urine a patient produces (diuretics), and drugs that attempt to preserve the pumping function of the heart (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).\n\nIn some patients with heart failure, a specialised pacemaker known as cardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used to improve the heart's pumping efficiency. These devices are frequently combined with a defibrillator. In very severe cases of heart failure, a small pump called a ventricular assist device may be implanted which supplements the heart's own pumping ability. In the most severe cases, a cardiac transplant may be considered.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient \n\nHumans have known about the heart since ancient times, although its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered to have been the primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be the organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.\n\nThe Greek physician Galen (2nd century CE) knew blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, concluded that it provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart and created arterial blood.\n\nThese ideas went unchallenged for almost a thousand years.\n\nPre-modern \nThe earliest descriptions of the coronary and pulmonary circulation systems can be found in the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon, published in 1242 by Ibn al-Nafis. In his manuscript, al-Nafis wrote that blood passes through the pulmonary circulation instead of moving from the right to the left ventricle as previously believed by Galen. His work was later translated into Latin by Andrea Alpago.\n\nIn Europe, the teachings of Galen continued to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted as a challenge to the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows from one side of the heart to the other via the lungs.\n\nModern \n\nA breakthrough in understanding the flow of blood through the heart and body came with the publication of De Motu Cordis (1628) by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey's book completely describes the systemic circulation and the mechanical force of the heart, leading to an overhaul of the Galenic doctrines. Otto Frank (1865–1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this important heart relationship. Ernest Starling (1866–1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied the heart. Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name \"Frank–Starling mechanism\".\n\nAlthough Purkinje fibers and the bundle of His were discovered as early as the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.\n\nThe first successful heart transplantation was performed in 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive for more than a few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed infectious disease as the leading cause of death in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.\n\nTransplantation of pig heart to human \nThe first successful transplant of a heart from a  genetically modified pig to a human, was performed January 7, 2022 in Baltimore by heart surgeon Bartley P. Griffith, recipient was David Bennett (57).\n\nSociety and culture\n\nSymbolism\n\nAs one of the vital organs, the heart was long identified as the center of the entire body, the seat of life, or emotion, or reason, will, intellect, purpose or the mind. The heart is an emblematic symbol in many religions, signifying \"truth, conscience or moral courage in many religions—the temple or throne of God in Islamic and Judeo-Christian thought; the divine centre, or atman, and the third eye of transcendent wisdom in Hinduism; the diamond of purity and essence of the Buddha; the Taoist centre of understanding.\"\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the word for heart, lev, is used in these meanings, as the seat of emotion, the mind, and referring to the anatomical organ. It is also connected in function and symbolism to the stomach.\n\nAn important part of the concept of the soul in Ancient Egyptian religion was thought to be the heart, or ib. The ib or metaphysical heart was believed to be formed from one drop of blood from the child's mother's heart, taken at conception. To ancient Egyptians, the heart was the seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention. This is evidenced by Egyptian expressions which incorporate the word ib, such as Awi-ib for \"happy\" (literally, \"long of heart\"), Xak-ib for \"estranged\" (literally, \"truncated of heart\"). In Egyptian religion, the heart was the key to the afterlife. It was conceived as surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the Weighing of the Heart ceremony. If the heart weighed more than the feather of Maat, which symbolized the ideal standard of behavior. If the scales balanced, it meant the heart's possessor had lived a just life and could enter the afterlife; if the heart was heavier, it would be devoured by the monster Ammit.\n\nThe Chinese character for \"heart\", 心, derives from a comparatively realistic depiction of a heart (indicating the heart chambers) in seal script. The Chinese word xīn also takes the metaphorical meanings of \"mind\", \"intention\", or \"core\". In Chinese medicine, the heart is seen as the center of 神 shén \"spirit, consciousness\". The heart is associated with the small intestine, tongue, governs the six organs and five viscera, and belongs to fire in the five elements.\n\nThe Sanskrit word for heart is hṛd or hṛdaya, found in the oldest surviving Sanskrit text, the Rigveda. In Sanskrit, it may mean both the anatomical object and \"mind\" or \"soul\", representing the seat of emotion. Hrd may be a cognate of the word for heart in Greek, Latin, and English.\n\nMany classical philosophers and scientists, including Aristotle, considered the heart the seat of thought, reason, or emotion, often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions. The identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular is due to the Roman physician Galen, who also located the seat of the passions in the liver, and the seat of reason in the brain.\n\nThe heart also played a role in the Aztec system of belief. The most common form of human sacrifice practiced by the Aztecs was heart-extraction. The Aztec believed that the heart (tona) was both the seat of the individual and a fragment of the Sun's heat (istli). To this day, the Nahua consider the Sun to be a heart-soul (tona-tiuh): \"round, hot, pulsating\".\n\nIn Catholicism, there has been a long tradition of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the parallel veneration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes.\n\nThe expression of a broken heart is a cross-cultural reference to grief for a lost one or to unfulfilled romantic love.\n\nThe notion of \"Cupid's arrows\" is ancient, due to Ovid, but while Ovid describes Cupid as wounding his victims with his arrows, it is not made explicit that it is the heart that is wounded. The familiar iconography of Cupid shooting little heart symbols is a Renaissance theme that became tied to Valentine's day.\n\nFood\n\nAnimal hearts are widely consumed as food. As they are almost entirely muscle, they are high in protein. They are often included in dishes with other offal, for example in the pan-Ottoman kokoretsi.\n\nChicken hearts are considered to be giblets, and are often grilled on skewers; examples of this are Japanese hāto yakitori, Brazilian churrasco de coração, and Indonesian chicken heart satay. They can also be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, they can be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken. Many recipes combined them with other giblets, such as the Mexican pollo en menudencias and the Russian ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov.\n\nThe hearts of beef, pork, and mutton can generally be interchanged in recipes. As heart is a hard-working muscle, it makes for \"firm and rather dry\" meat, so is generally slow-cooked. Another way of dealing with toughness is to julienne the meat, as in Chinese stir-fried heart.\n\nBeef heart may be grilled or braised. In the Peruvian anticuchos de corazón, barbecued beef hearts are grilled after being tenderized through long marination in a spice and vinegar mixture. An Australian recipe for \"mock goose\" is actually braised stuffed beef heart.\n\nPig heart is stewed, poached, braised, or made into sausage. The Balinese oret is a sort of blood sausage made with pig heart and blood. A French recipe for cœur de porc à l'orange is made of braised heart with an orange sauce.\n\nOther animals\n\nVertebrates\nThe size of the heart varies among the different animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging from those of the smallest mice (12 mg) to the blue whale (600 kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies in the middle of the ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. which in some fish may be connected to the peritoneum.\n\nThe sinoatrial node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous, and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat, which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.\n\nDouble circulatory systems\n\nAdult amphibians and most reptiles have a double circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers—two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from the lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart. \n\nIn reptiles, other than snakes, the heart is usually situated around the middle of the thorax. In terrestrial and arborial snakes it is usually located nearer to the head; in aquatic species the heart is more centrally located. There is a heart with three chambers: two atria and one ventricle. The form and function of these hearts are different than mammalian hearts due to the fact that snakes have an elongated body, and thus are affected by different environmental factors. In particular, the snake's heart relative to the position in their body has been influenced greatly by gravity. Therefore, snakes that are larger in size tend to have a higher blood pressure due to gravitational change. The ventricle is incompletely separated into two-halves by a wall (septum), with a considerable gap near the pulmonary artery and aortic openings. In most reptilian species, there appears to be little, if any, mixing between the bloodstreams, so the aorta receives, essentially, only oxygenated blood. The exception to this rule is crocodiles, which have a four-chambered heart.\n\nIn the heart of lungfish, the septum extends partway into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.\n\nFull division \nArchosaurs (crocodilians and birds) and mammals show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, at the base of the arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood—those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations—permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.\n\nFish\n\nFish have what is often described as a two-chambered heart, consisting of one atrium to receive blood and one ventricle to pump it. However, the fish heart has entry and exit compartments that may be called chambers, so it is also sometimes described as three-chambered or four-chambered, depending on what is counted as a chamber. The atrium and ventricle are sometimes considered \"true chambers\", while the others are considered \"accessory chambers\".\n\nPrimitive fish have a four-chambered heart, but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood from the body through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus, which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).\n\nIn the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but instead form an S-shape, with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simple pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.\n\nInvertebrates\n\nArthropods and most mollusks have an open circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood collects around the heart in cavities (sinuses). This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. The heart in arthropods is typically a muscular tube that runs the length of the body, under the back and from the base of the head. Instead of blood the circulatory fluid is haemolymph which carries the most commonly used respiratory pigment, copper-based haemocyanin as the oxygen transporter. Haemoglobin is only used by a few arthropods.\n\nIn some other invertebrates such as earthworms, the circulatory system is not used to transport oxygen and so is much reduced, having no veins or arteries and consisting of two connected tubes. Oxygen travels by diffusion and there are five small muscular vessels that connect these vessels that contract at the front of the animals that can be thought of as \"hearts\".\n\nSquids and other cephalopods have two \"gill hearts\" also known as branchial hearts, and one \"systemic heart\". The branchial hearts have two atria and one ventricle each, and pump to the gills, whereas the systemic heart pumps to the body.\n\nOnly the chordates (including vertebrates) and the hemichordates have a central \"heart\", which is a vesicle formed from the thickening of the aorta and contracts to pump blood.

The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins make up the vasculature. The cardiovascular system circulates about 5 liters of blood at a rate of approximately 6 L/m. The pulmonary and the systemic circulations are the two parts of the vasculature. The pulmonary circulation system consists of the network of blood vessels from the right heart to the lungs and back to the left heart. \n\nIn most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The left atrium and left ventricle are referred to as the left heart, while the right atrium and right ventricle are known as the right heart. This four-chambered structure allows for efficient blood flow and separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.\n\nThe heart's chambers work together in a coordinated manner to pump blood throughout the body. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, the blood moves into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood into the pulmonary circulation - the pathway leading to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide.\n\nThe oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. This systemic circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients to the various tissues and organs, ensuring their proper function.\n\nThe smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure that it moves in a unidirectional manner. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid.\n\nIt's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body.\n\nReference:\n\"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals...\"\n\n The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The left and right sides of the heart have different functions: the right side receives blood coming from the body through the superior and inferior venae cavae and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while the left side receives saturated blood from the lungs.\n\n The heart has four chambers: the left and right atriums and the left and right ventricles. They form a shallow groove at the line of their junction, which form the atrioventricular groove. The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart.\n\nQuestion: How many chambers has the heart?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is responsible for the movement of the gluteus maximus in activities requiring the hip to extend the thigh, such as climbing stairs. Injury to this nerve is rare but often occurs as a complication of posterior approach to the hip during hip replacement. When damaged, one would develop gluteus maximus lurch, which is a gait abnormality which causes the individual to 'lurch' backwards to compensate lack in hip extension.\n\nAnatomy\nThe largest muscle of the posterior hip, gluteus maximus, is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve.\nIt branches out and then enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus, the principal extensor of the thigh, and supplies it.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe muscle is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve which arises from the dorsal branches of the ventral rami of the fifth (L5), the first (S1) and second (S2) sacral nerves.\n\nThe lumbosacral trunk, which is made up of L5 and a small branch of L4, effectively connects the lumbar and sacral plexuses. The lower branches of the L4 and the L5 nerves enter the sacral plexus.\n\nThe sacral plexus is formed by the lumbosacral trunk, the first to third sacral ventral rami, and part of the fourth, the remainder of the last joining the coccygeal plexus. The sacral plexus is formed in the pelvis in front of the piriformis muscle.\n\nThe sacral plexus is formed anterior to the piriformis muscle and gives rise to the sciatic nerve, the superior and inferior gluteal nerves, and the pudendal and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves.\n\nHowever, most of the sacral plexus nerves are scarcely recognizable, because they leave the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. From the pelvis, the anterior primary branches of the nerves entering the plexus (the first sacral nerve being a particularly large one) and a mass of nerves on the piriformis can be recognized.\n\nCourse\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and runs underneath the piriformis muscle. It then divides into muscular branches to supply the gluteus maximus that pass posteriorly into the deep surface of the gluteus maximus muscle.\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve is superficial to the sciatic nerve. It has been described as having multiple branches with subsequent innervation of the overlying gluteus maximus.\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus very inferiorly.  At the lower border of the piriformis muscle, the nerve turns backward and divides into upward and downward diverging branches, which enter the gluteus maximus. The nerve may also send a branch to the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve reliably emerged inferior to the piriformis muscle. The branching characteristics of the nerve falls into two broad categories.One category is short stalks which came under the piriformis and then gave rise to all of the terminal branches of the nerve which spanned the muscle of the gluteus maximus. The number of branches from the stalk ranged from four to six. The second category occurs as a partial split of the stalk that occurred proximal to the coverage of the piriformis. There were two to three divisions of the inferior gluteal nerve under the piriformis that would further divide close to the insertion of the nerve into the actual muscle belly.\n\nThe nerve was always seen close to and medial to the sciatic nerve when it left the sacral plexus inferior to the piriformis. In all specimens, the nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus approximately 5 cm from the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur and entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus over the inferior one-third of the muscle belly.\n\nThe inferior gluteal nerve is accompanied by the inferior gluteal artery, a branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery.\n\nHowever the relationship between the inferior gluteal nerve and artery was found to be unpredictable.\nNo consistent relationship between the inferior gluteal artery and the inferior gluteal nerve was observed in current studies.\n\nThere is a relationship between the common stalk of the inferior gluteal nerve and external anatomic landmarks. The targeted region should be aimed inferior to the most prominent aspect of the greater trochanter, and medial to the landmark of the ischial tuberosity, at the depth of the posterior border of the proximal femur. Triangulating using these three coordinates, one can reliably reach the source of the inferior gluteal nerve. This will result in maximal stimulation of the gluteus maximus musculature when using electrical stimulation for the purpose of prevention of pressure ulcers.\n\nThe sciatic nerve (L4 to S3), the largest nerve of the body, immediately leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis. The superior gluteal nerve passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen, above the piriformis: the inferior gluteal nerve also passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen but below the piriformis.\"\n\nFunction\nThe major function of the gluteus maximus is to extend the flexed thigh and bring it inline with the trunk. It may prevent the forward momentum of the trunk from producing flexion at the supporting hip during bipedal gait. It is intermittently active in the walking cycle and in climbing stairs and continuously active in strong lateral rotation and abduction of the thigh and also stabilizes the femur on the tibia when the knee extensors are relaxed. In addition to this, the gluteus maximus has an important role during some activities like running or standing up.\n\nThe gluteus maximus, a large muscle with numerous attachments, is a powerful extensor of the thigh or of the trunk lower limbs are in a fixed position. The gluteus maximus is also a strong hip stabilzer. It extends thigh at the hip, assists in laterally rotating the thigh.  It contracts at heel-strike, slowing forward motion of trunk by arresting flexion of the hip and initiating extension. This movement prevents trunk from falling forward.\n\nSurprisingly, however, the gluteus maximus is not important posturally, is relaxed when one is standing, and is little used in walking. It is employed in running, climbing, and rising from a sitting or stooped position. It also controls flexion at the hip upon sitting down.\n\nInjury\n\nFrom hip replacement\n\nInferior gluteal entrapment neuropathy is rarely reported but is recognized as a complication of the posterior approach to hip arthroplasty. Injuries to the peripheral nerves occur in 0.5% to 8% of patients undergoing total hip replacement.\n\nThe posterior approach has been assessed most widely and is perhaps the most frequently used, but it is also the one most likely to be associated with damage to the inferior gluteal nerve since this structure is not usually seen. Direct abnormalities of the nerve may be difficult to detect due to the small size of the nerve, although signal intensity alterations in the gluteus maximus may be encountered\n\nDiagnostic imaging of peripheral nerves about the hip is a challenging task due to the complex regional anatomy, the small size and intricate course of many nerves. There are also a variety of clinical situations leading to local disturbances in the nerve function the positioning of the inferior gluteal nerve makes it vulnerable to iagtrogenic injury during posterior and posterior approaches to the hip\n\nIt is subject to injury by compression and ischemia in sedentary individuals, resulting in difficulty in rising from a sitting position and difficulty climbing stairs.\n\nThe incidence of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve after replacement of the hip is still uncertain. Peripheral nerve injury may occur during operations on the hip as a result of operative trauma associated with stretching and retraction of the nerve. Few studies have focused on damage to the inferior gluteal nerve during hip replacement.\n\nIn ten other patients who had a posterior approach, nine had abnormal electromyographic findings in inferior gluteal innervated muscles and eight of the ten also had abnormalities in superior gluteal innervated muscles. They suggested that abnormalities of gait after the operation may be due to injury to these nerves.\n\nThe reduction in walking speed and persistently abnormal gait, sometimes seen in patients one year after total hip replacement, were associated with a decrease in the extensor moment with a resultant decrease in the range of extension of the hip and a reduction in the abductor moment.\n\nWhen a muscle-splitting incision is made across gluteus maximus as part of the classical posterior approach and the muscle parted by hand-held or self-retaining retractors, the likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is high.  \nThe nerve enters the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualised and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as the blood vessels. Parting the muscle damages the nerve further by stretching or even rupturing its branches which run superiorly on its deep surface.\n\nEntrapment neuropathy is an underrecognized cause of pain and functional impairment caused by acute or chronic injury to peripheral nerves.\n\nAlthough nerves may be injured anywhere along their course, they are more prone to compression, entrapment, or stretching as they traverse anatomically vulnerable regions, such as superficial or geographically constrained spaces.\nSubclinical electromyographic abnormalities of both the superior and inferior gluteal nerves have been described in up to 77% of patients after total hip replacement, regardless of the surgical approach.\n\nThe posterior approach is the most common and practical of those used to expose the hip joint. The posterior approaches allow excellent visualization of the femoral shaft, thus are popular for revision joint replacement surgery in cases in which the femoral component needs to be replaced. The likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is reported to be high when a muscle-splitting incision is made across the gluteus maximus as a part of the classical posterior approach to the hip.\n\nThis may cause selective denervation of the gluteus maximus since the inferior gluteal nerve courses along the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualized and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as blood vessels.\n\nGluteus maximus lurch\n\nInjury to this nerve leads to a gluteus maximus lurch. When gluteus maximus is weak/injured, trunk extends (lean back) on heel-strike on weakened side. This compensates for weakness of hip extension.\n\nDamage to the inferior gluteal nerve causes loss of extension at hip, and causes the buttock to  waste.\n\nThe normal gluteus maximus gait is when the gluteus maxims begins to contract at moment of heel-strike, slowing forward motion of trunk by arresting flexion of hip and initiating extension. When gluteus maximus is weak, trunk lurches backward (gluteus maximus lurch) at heel-strike on weakened side to interrupt forward motion of the trunk.\n\nThere is great difficulty in preventing the flexion of the trunk heel strike so the person may use trunk extension before heel strike to maintain balance causing a backwards lurch. The trunk lurches back on the stance phase side hyperextending.\nThe backwards trunk lurch persists throughout the stance to maintain the gravitational force line behind the hip axis locking the hip into extension. There is an apparent forward protrusion of the affected hip due to exaggerated hip motion and the person may also hold the shoulders backward to keep the center of gravity behind the joint. The hamstring muscles often compensate for the gluteus maximus weakness resulting in a near normal gait pattern but most often these muscles are affected together.\n\nSee also\n Superior gluteal nerve\n Inferior gluteal artery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Gluteus Maximus Lurch / Inferior Gluteal Nerve This video is a demonstration of gluteus maximus lurch caused by damage to the inferior gluteal nerve.\n\nNerves of the lower limb and lower torso\n\n The piriformis muscle is part of the lateral rotators of the hip, along with the quadratus femoris, gemellus inferior, gemellus superior, obturator externus, and obturator internus. The piriformis laterally rotates the femur with hip extension and abducts the femur with hip flexion. Abduction of the flexed thigh is important in the action of walking because it shifts the body weight to the opposite side of the foot being lifted, which prevents falling. The action of the lateral rotators can be understood by crossing the legs to rest an ankle on the knee of the other leg. This causes the femur to rotate and point the knee laterally. The lateral rotators also oppose medial rotation by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. When the hip is flexed to 90 degrees, piriformis abducts the femur at the hip and reverses primary function, internally rotating the hip when the hip is flexed at 90 degrees or more. (Netter's Clinical Anatomy, 2010)\n\nBy size: brevis means short; longus means long; major means large; maximus means largest; minor means small, and minimus smallest. These terms are often used after the particular muscle such as gluteus maximus, and gluteus minimus. ; By shape: deltoid means triangular; quadratus means having four sides; rhomboideus means having a rhomboid shape; teres means round or cylindrical, and trapezius means having a trapezoid shape. Examples are the pronator teres, and the pronator quadratus. ; By action: abductor moving away from the midline; adductor moving towards the midline; depressor moving downwards; elevator moving upwards; flexor moving that decreases an angle; extensor moving that increase an angle or straightens; pronator moving to face down; supinator moving to face upwards; internal rotator rotating towards the body; external rotator rotating away from the body. There are a number of terms used in the naming of muscles including those relating to size, shape, action, location, their orientation, and their number of heads.\n\nThe piriformis muscle and the gluteus maximus muscle have different functions in the human musculature. \n\nThe piriformis muscle is pear-shaped and lies deep to the gluteus medius muscle. It is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and plays a role in various phases of normal gait. This muscle also has an intermittent action and is important for its contribution to maintaining balance while walking. Tight hamstrings can sometimes be associated with low back pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the gluteus maximus muscle is the largest and most superficial muscle in the gluteal region. It is responsible for attaining an upright posture and arises from various structures including the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, and ligaments. The fibers of the gluteus maximus run inferolaterally and attach distally to the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity of the femur. This muscle can extend the thigh from a flexed position when the pelvis is fixed, aid in strong lateral rotation of the thigh, and contribute to strong abduction at the hip. It also helps rotate the pelvis posteriorly on the femur heads when the thigh is stabilized. The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is important for stabilizing the femur on the tibia.\n\nIn summary, the piriformis muscle is involved in gait and maintaining balance, while the gluteus maximus muscle is responsible for posture, thigh extension, lateral rotation, abduction, and stabilizing the femur on the tibia.\n\nMedial fascial compartment of thigh, adductor ; Posterior fascial compartment of thigh, flexion, hamstring ; Anterior fascial compartment of thigh, extension In cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate compartments, divided by fascia, each containing muscles. These compartments use the femur as an axis and are separated by tough connective tissue membranes (or septa). Each of these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply, and contains a different group of muscles.  Anterior compartment muscles of the thigh include sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles- rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis. Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Medial compartment muscles are pectineus, adductor magnus, adductor longus and adductor brevis, and also gracilis. Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the large buttock and thigh muscle?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation. The growing follicle passes through the following distinct stages that are defined by certain structural characteristics: In a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from primordial to preovulatory follicle, belongs to the stage of ootidogenesis of oogenesis. In addition, follicles that have formed an antrum are called antral follicles or Graafian follicles. Definitions differ in where this shift occurs in the staging given above, with some stating that it occurs when entering the secondary stage, and others stating that it occurs when entering the tertiary stage. Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. During the late preovulatory stage, the oocyte continues meiosis and becomes a secondary oocyte, arrested in metaphase II. \n\nAfter ovulation, several physiological changes occur in the female reproductive system. One significant change is the transformation of the ruptured follicle into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes hormones such as progesterone and estrogen, which play essential roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.\n\nProgesterone and estrogen stimulate the thickening of the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. This thickening prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. If fertilization occurs, progesterone helps maintain the endometrium and supports the early stages of pregnancy. However, if fertilization does not occur, the levels of progesterone decrease, leading to the shedding of the endometrium during menstruation.\n\nThe ovulation process, which marks the release of an egg from the follicle, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). This surge induces the release of the mature egg, which then travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, potentially for fertilization.\n\nThese physiological changes in the female reproductive system after ovulation are crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the preparation of the uterus for potential pregnancy.\n\nThe hypothalamus and pituitary gland play crucial roles in regulating the menstrual cycle and facilitating ovulation. The hypothalamus, a region in the brain, monitors the hormone output of the ovaries and synchronizes the normal menstrual cycle. After the monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). This hormone stimulates the pituitary gland, also located in the brain, to release two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).\n\nFSH and LH have distinct roles in the menstrual cycle and ovulation. FSH stimulates the ovary to start producing estrogen, mainly estradiol, and also stimulates the maturation of multiple follicles (fluid-filled structures containing eggs) in the ovary. Among these follicles, one will become dominant and continue its maturation process.\n\nWhen the dominant follicle is fully mature, LH triggers its release from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. The released egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus for potential fertilization. After ovulation, the follicle quickly transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing the hormone progesterone, which prepares the uterine lining for potential implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\nThe rise in progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle thickens the uterine lining and inhibits further ovulation by suppressing the production of FSH and LH. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels. This drop in progesterone triggers the shedding of the uterine lining, resulting in menstruation and the start of a new menstrual cycle.\n\nIn summary, the hypothalamus regulates the hormone output of the ovaries through the secretion of GnRH, while the pituitary gland releases FSH and LH in response to GnRH. FSH stimulates estrogen production and follicle maturation, while LH triggers ovulation and the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then produces progesterone, which prepares the uterus for potential implantation.\n\n Ovarian pregnancy refers to an ectopic pregnancy that is located in the ovary. Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy. An untreated ovarian pregnancy causes potentially fatal intra-abdominal bleeding and thus may become a medical emergency.\n\nUnderstanding your menstrual cycle is a critical step in getting pregnant. In order to achieve pregnancy, ovulation (release of the egg from the ovary) must occur. Therefore, one of the main questions women ask is, “How do I know I am ovulating?” The answer to this is fairly simple– in general, women who have regular menstrual cycles can be fairly certain that they are ovulating. We know this because in order for a period to come regularly there are certain events that must occur in the ovary and uterus.\nFirst, several of the immature eggs present in the ovary at the beginning of the cycle will begin developing and growing. The older a woman is, the less eggs are available every month. During the first 9 or 10 days of the cycle, one of the eggs is selected by the ovary to be the “dominant” egg that will eventually mature completely and be released. While it is maturing, the ovary produces estrogen which tells the brain that the ovary is working and also causes thickening of the uterine lining getting ready for implantation of a fertilized egg. Once this egg reaches maturity within its follicle (fluid filled cavity), a surge of hormones from the brain called LH (luteinizing hormone which can be measured by an ovulation predictor kit) causes release of the egg from its follicle. Once the egg is released, the now empty follicle is called a corpus luteum cyst and has the sole purpose of producing the hormone progesterone which acts as the glue keeping the uterine lining intact in preparation for an embryo implanting. The egg will then be picked up by one of the fallopian tubes and hopefully become fertilized by sperm in the tube and then travel into the uterus where it will implant into the thickened uterine wall.\nIf the egg is successfully fertilized by a sperm and does successfully implant into the wall, the tissue releases human chorionic gonadotropin HCG hormone (the hormone of pregnancy) which causes pregnancy tests to turn positive. If pregnancy does not occur, then the corpus luteum in the ovary stops producing progesterone after approximately 14 days and the lack of progesterone in the uterus causes the lining of the uterus to shed – the beginning of a woman’s period.\nHow Many Days Out of the Month is a Woman Fertile?\nMany people often ask, “How many days out of the month is a woman fertile?” The answer is varies from person to person, however, typically women ovulate for about 5-6 days every month. Ovulation usually occurs 12-15 days before a woman’s menstrual period begins. Often women track their ovulation using a calendar based on their last menstrual cycle. Other techniques for tracking ovulation include basal body temperature, hormone monitoring, and the cervical mucus method.\nCan You Only Get Pregnant on your Fertile Days?\nAlthough it is most likely that women will conceive during ovulation, it is not always the case. Sperm can live in the woman’s reproductive tract for up to five days. If ovulation occurs within a few days after the sperm has been released into the reproductive tract, pregnancy can occur.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These pacemaker cells generate electrical impulses that stimulate the contraction of the heart muscle. The impulses travel through the conduction system of the heart, specifically the atrioventricular (AV) node, bundle of His, Purkinje fibers, and the myocardium, causing the heart to contract in a coordinated manner.\n\nThe SA node is often referred to as the \"natural pacemaker\" of the heart because it initiates the electrical signals that regulate the heart's rhythm. It generates electrical impulses at a regular rate, which is typically around 60 to 100 times per minute in a healthy adult at rest. The impulses from the SA node spread throughout the atria, causing them to contract, and then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, resulting in their contraction as well. This coordinated contraction and relaxation of the heart's chambers allow for efficient pumping of blood throughout the body.\n\nVarious factors can influence the heart's rhythm. The autonomic nervous system plays a significant role in modulating the heart rate. The sympathetic nervous system releases epinephrine and norepinephrine, which increase heart rate and force of contraction, preparing the body for increased activity or stress. On the other hand, the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which slows down the heart rate and promotes relaxation.\n\nAdditionally, hormonal factors such as adrenaline, thyroid hormones, and electrolyte imbalances can also affect the heart's rhythm. Certain medical conditions, such as arrhythmias, heart block, or heart diseases, can disrupt the normal rhythm of the heart and may require medical intervention to restore normal function.\n\nIn summary, the rhythm of the heart's contractions is primarily determined by the pacemaker cells in the SA node, which generate electrical impulses that regulate the coordinated contraction of the heart's chambers. The autonomic nervous system, hormones, and medical conditions can also influence the heart's rhythm. Regular cardiovascular exercise has been shown to have positive effects on heart health and can help regulate the heart's rhythm in the long term.\n\n If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum. If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers are occasionally capable of acting as the default or \"escape\" pacemaker. The reason Purkinje cells do not normally control the heart rate is that they generate action potentials at a lower frequency than the AV or SA nodes.\n\n If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. These cells form the Atrioventricular node (or AV node), which is an area between the left atrium and the right ventricle within the atrial septum, will take over the pacemaker responsibility. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker. Further down the electrical conducting system of the heart is the Bundle of His. The left and right branches of this bundle, and the Purkinje fibers, will also produce a spontaneous action potential at a rate of 30-40 beats per minute, so if the SA and AV node both fail to function, \n\nThe part with the highest autonomy in the human body is the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the sinus node or the sinus pacemaker. The SA node is a small group of specialized cells located in the right atrium of the heart. It serves as the natural pacemaker of the heart, initiating the electrical signals that regulate the heart's rhythm. \n\nThe SA node has the highest autonomy because it is responsible for initiating the electrical impulses that control the heart's contraction rate. These electrical signals travel through the heart's conduction system, causing the atria to contract and subsequently stimulating the atrioventricular (AV) node. From there, the signal is transmitted to the ventricles, leading to their contraction and pumping blood to the rest of the body. \n\nThe SA node has its own intrinsic rhythm, independent of external signals. However, it can also be influenced by various factors, such as the autonomic nervous system, hormones, and body temperature. These factors can increase or decrease the heart rate by modifying the SA node's electrical activity. For example, the sympathetic nervous system can increase heart rate, while the parasympathetic nervous system can slow it down.\n\nUltimately, the autonomy of the SA node allows it to regulate the heart's rhythm independently, making it the part with the highest autonomy in the body.\n\n  The contraction of cardiac muscle (heart muscle) in all animals is initiated by electrical impulses known as action potentials. The rate at which these impulses fire controls the rate of cardiac contraction, that is, the heart rate. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. Cardiac arrhythmias can cause heart block, in which the contractions lose any useful rhythm. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The testes are responsible for producing sperm and testosterone. Within the testes, there are two main compartments - the intralobular compartment containing Sertoli cells and developing sperm cells, and the interlobular/interstitial compartment containing Leydig cells and a capillary plexus.\n\nSpermatogenesis is the process by which sperm cells are formed within the testes. It involves a series of cell divisions and differentiations. Spermiogenesis then follows, which is the maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa.\n\nThe Sertoli cells within the testes play crucial roles in supporting and nourishing the developing sperm cells. They provide structural support, help in hormone production and release, and create a blood-testis barrier.\n\nTestosterone, the primary male sex hormone, is synthesized by Leydig cells within the testes. It is essential for the development and maintenance of male reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics. Testosterone can be converted to either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone peripherally.\n\nIn the male hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the maturation of Sertoli cells, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone.\n\nThe female reproductive system consists of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. The ovaries are responsible for producing eggs and female sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone. Ovaries contain numerous follicles, in different stages of development, which release eggs during ovulation. After ovulation, the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum.\n\nThe stages of follicular development in the ovary include primordial follicles, primary follicles, secondary follicles, mature or Graafian follicles, and the ruptured follicle during ovulation. The process of oogenesis involves the progression of female germ cells from oogonia to primary oocytes, which are arrested in prophase I until puberty.\n\nThe steroidogenic pathways in the ovaries involve the conversion of cholesterol to androgens, which are then converted to estrogen or progesterone.\n\nIn the female hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. FSH promotes follicular development, while LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum.\n\nDuring the menstrual cycle, the uterine endometrium undergoes cyclic changes. It thickens during the proliferative phase in response to estrogen stimulation and prepares for potential implantation. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the endometrium sheds during menstruation.\n\nFertilization occurs when a sperm penetrates and fertilizes an egg in the fallopian tube. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage and develops into an embryo. The placenta forms and provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo/fetus.\n\nThe mammary glands develop in response to hormonal changes during puberty and pregnancy. They produce milk to nourish newborns after birth.\n\nIn summary, the male reproductive system includes the testes, while the female reproductive system includes the ovaries. Both systems have structures involved in gamete production, hormone secretion, and the potential for fertilization and gestation.\n\nThe stages of reproduction include sex determination during fetal development, sexual maturation during puberty, conception, pregnancy, lactation, and child rearing, and the cessation of reproductive capability at menopause. Each of these stages involves the interplay of multiple hormones.\n\nDuring the menstrual cycle, which is approximately 28 days, there are dynamic hormonal changes that occur. In the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are secreted pulsatively, stimulating the maturation of the ovarian follicle. As a result, estrogen and progesterone levels gradually increase.\n\nThe increase in estrogen and progesterone levels leads to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Combined with accelerated GnRH secretion, this triggers the LH surge and rupture of the mature follicle. The rupture of the follicle marks the release of an egg from the ovary, which is known as ovulation.\n\nAfter ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Progesterone prepares the uterus for possible pregnancy by thickening the endometrial lining, making it suitable for embryo implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum disintegrates, leading to a decrease in hormone levels.\n\nHormones also play a crucial role in other stages of reproduction. During fetal development, sex determination occurs under the influence of hormone signaling. During puberty, the hormones LH, FSH, estrogen, and testosterone are responsible for the physical changes associated with sexual maturation.\n\nIn conception, hormones such as LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After conception, various hormones including progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prolactin support the development of pregnancy, maintenance of the pregnancy, and initiation of lactation.\n\nFinally, the stage of menopause is characterized by a decline in hormone production, particularly estrogen and progesterone. This leads to the cessation of reproductive capability and the end of menstrual cycles.\n\nOverall, hormones play a vital role in each stage of reproduction by regulating the development and function of reproductive organs, controlling the menstrual cycle, supporting pregnancy, and facilitating the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation and menopause.\n\n Either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (such as Lupron) may be used in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) using an infusion pump to simulate endogenous hormone production. GnRH stimulates the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the anterior pituitary in the body. This set of therapy is reserved for a subset of women with infertility and have produced ovulation rates of 90% and pregnancy rates of 80% or higher.\n\nThe hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads play crucial roles in regulating sex hormones. The hypothalamus, located in the brain, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the bloodstream. GnRH then stimulates the pituitary gland, which is a small gland located at the base of the brain.\n\nIn response to GnRH, the pituitary gland releases two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH then travel through the bloodstream to the gonads, which are the testes in males and ovaries in females.\n\nIn males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an androgen hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics. FSH, on the other hand, promotes the production of sperm by stimulating the cells in the testes called Sertoli cells. Together, testosterone and sperm production are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in males.\n\nIn females, FSH acts on the ovarian follicles, promoting the development of eggs. The follicles then produce estrogen, which is responsible for the development of female sexual characteristics. LH surge, which occurs midway through the menstrual cycle, triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Progesterone prepares the uterus for potential pregnancy.\n\nOverall, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. FSH and LH then regulate the production of sex hormones in the gonads, such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, which play essential roles in maintaining reproductive functions in both males and females.\n\n by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation. Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, inhibits the follicular growth and maintains the pregnancy. The endocrine system coincides with the menstrual cycle and goes through thirteen cycles (and thus thirteen LH spikes) during the course of normal folliculogenesis. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A stable binary hydride, and the simplest pnictogen hydride, ammonia is a colourless gas with a distinct pungent smell. It is a common nitrogenous waste, particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to 45 percent of the world's food and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products. It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water. Although common in nature – both terrestrially and in the outer planets of the Solar System – and in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form. In the United States it is classified as \n\n In atmospheric chemistry,  is a generic term for the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for air pollution, namely nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide. These gases contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain, as well as affecting tropospheric ozone. gases are usually produced from the reaction among nitrogen and oxygen during combustion of fuels, such as hydrocarbons, in air; especially at high temperatures, such as in car engines. In areas of high motor vehicle traffic, such as in large cities, the nitrogen oxides emitted can be a significant source of air pollution. gases are also produced naturally by lightning. The term is chemistry shorthand for molecules containing one nitrogen and one \n\n Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.288% by mass of the Earth's atmosphere. Air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.\n\n  Ammonia is both a metabolic waste and a metabolic input throughout the biosphere. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N2 gas. Therefore, nitrogen fixation is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing legumes, benefit from symbiotic relationships with rhizobia that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.\n\n Petroleum extraction disrupts the equilibrium of earth's carbon cycle by transporting sequestered geologic carbon into the biosphere. The carbon is used by consumers in various forms and a large fraction is combusted into the atmosphere; thus creating massive amounts of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as a waste product. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. Since the industrial age began circa 1750–1850 with growing wood and coal use, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane have increased about 50% and 150%, respectively, above their relatively stable levels of the prior 800,000+ years. Each is currently increasing at a rate of about 1% every year, since about half of the added carbon has been absorbed by Earth's land vegetation and ocean sinks. The growth in annual emissions has also been so rapid that the total amount of fossil carbon extracted in the last 30 years exceeds the total amount extracted during all prior human history.\n\nQuestion: What is the second most common gas in the atmosphere?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer. ; Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber, also known as an algae turf scrubber.  Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS). Scientists developed the \n\n One of the reasons the lake cannot support many fish is because of severe pollution from phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, as well as lack of circulation to the deeper parts of the lake. This allows a detritus sludge to form that is devoid of oxygen, not allowing the organic compounds to break down efficiently. The phosphorus, nitrogen and ammonia collect in the lake water and the lake bed from polluted streams that run into the lake after passing through farm fields, barnyards and subdivisions. As it is now, the 2.4 mi-long lake is murky. The sun warms the top layer of lake water and makes it suitable for warm-water fish \n\nNutrient and sediment runoff from container nurseries can have several potential consequences on downstream water bodies. The runoff from these nurseries contains significant amounts of nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and sediment (total suspended solids), which can contribute to eutrophication of the receiving streams or water bodies.\n\nEutrophication is the process where excessive nutrients in the water promote excessive plant and algal growth, leading to a decrease in oxygen levels and overall degradation of water quality. This can have several negative effects on downstream water bodies, including:\n\n1. Oxygen depletion: The excessive growth of algae and plants fueled by the nutrients can lead to oxygen depletion in the water. This can harm aquatic organisms, such as fish and invertebrates, that rely on dissolved oxygen for survival.\n\n2. Disruption of aquatic ecosystems: Eutrophication can disrupt the balance of aquatic ecosystems by altering the natural habitat and food chain. The excessive growth of algae can block sunlight from reaching other aquatic plants, affecting their growth and survival. Additionally, the decomposition of the excessive plant biomass can further deplete oxygen levels, leading to fish kills and other negative impacts.\n\n3. Algal blooms and water discoloration: The high nutrient levels can result in algal blooms, where large quantities of algae rapidly grow and cover the surface of the water. These blooms can lead to water discoloration, unpleasant odors, and the production of toxins harmful to humans and aquatic life.\n\n4. Decreased water clarity: Sediment runoff from nurseries can cause increased turbidity and decreased water clarity. This can negatively impact underwater vegetation by limiting sunlight penetration and inhibiting their growth.\n\nTo mitigate the potential consequences of nutrient and sediment runoff, it is important for container nurseries to implement best management practices such as erosion control measures, proper nutrient management, and appropriate stormwater management systems. These practices can help reduce the amount of runoff and minimize the impact on downstream water bodies.\n\nSurface runoff from farm fields during heavy rainstorms can have several potential consequences. One major concern is the erosion of topsoil. When heavy rains occur, the water can wash away the fertile top layer of soil, which is essential for plant growth and agriculture. This can lead to reduced crop productivity and loss of valuable nutrients.\n\nAdditionally, surface runoff can carry agricultural fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can contribute to water pollution, leading to eutrophication (excessive nutrient enrichment) and harmful algal blooms. These blooms can deplete oxygen levels in the water, causing harm to aquatic organisms and disrupting the balance of ecosystems.\n\nMoreover, surface runoff may transport sediment and other pollutants such as bacteria or pathogens from livestock waste into streams, rivers, or lakes. This can pose risks to human health if these contaminated waters are used for drinking or recreational purposes.\n\nTo mitigate these consequences, various best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented on farms. These include contour plowing, strip cropping, cover crops, and buffer zones along water bodies. These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality.\n\nOverall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.\n\nReference:\n- Surface Runoff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff\n\n which nutrients are added to a water body from any of a wide variety of polluting inputs including untreated or partially treated sewage, industrial wastewater and fertilizer from farming practices. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal and aquatic plant growth. The visible effect of eutrophication is often nuisance algal blooms that can cause substantial ecological degradation in water bodies and associated streams. This process may result in oxygen depletion of the water body after the bacterial degradation of the algae. Approaches for prevention and reversal of eutrophication include: minimizing point source pollution from sewage, and minimizing nutrient pollution from agriculture and other nonpoint pollution sources. Shellfish in estuaries, seaweed farming and geo-engineering in lakes are also being used, some at the experimental stage.\n\nQuestion: What is the term for nutrient enrichment of lakes?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The species is also a popular pet in Russia, as many pet parrots were brought back from Cuba by Russian soldiers following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Despite increased availability in recent times, the Cuban amazon is still one of the highest-priced of all amazons. Several colour mutations have been observed in captive-bred stock. In the Cayman Islands, Cuban amazons (locally known as Cayman parrots) are sometimes removed from the wild and illegally kept as pets. In 2020, the authorities held an amnesty during which parrot owners could legally register their pets, which were then given health checks and fitted with microchips and leg bands in order to identify and distinguish them from wild birds. 326 parrots were registered during this amnesty.\n\n rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 km of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1911) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy. Although a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through \n\n the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash ...

All this work created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a 700 km \"outer wall\" from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a 1000 km network of \"inner walls\" north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications 1400 km in length and 440 km in diameter. Some of these walls had inner moats (from 10 to 60 m in width), beacon towers, battlements, parapets, and outward-facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall—features that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors.\n\nQuestion: Five-legged creatures have damaged which 1250 mile long wonder of the world?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm. The most common forms of radioactive decay are: Other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy \n\nThe substance with the largest half-life is radium. Radium is a radioactive element that was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre in 1898. It has a very long half-life, which refers to the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay into a different element.\n\nRadium-226, the most common isotope of radium, has a half-life of approximately 1,600 years. This means that it takes about 1,600 years for half of the radium-226 atoms to decay into other elements. Due to its long half-life, radium decays very slowly, making it one of the most persistent radioactive elements found in the environment.\n\nRadium is commonly found in small quantities in the Earth's crust and is a decay product of uranium and thorium. It emits alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and is known for its ability to glow in the dark.\n\nIt's important to note that due to its radioactivity, radium can present health risks if not handled properly. Exposure to high levels of radium can increase the risk of cancer and other health issues. Therefore, it is crucial to follow safety protocols and guidelines when working with or around radium.\n\n the total energy of the alpha. By some estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the recoil nucleus is part of an atom that is much larger than an alpha particle, and causes a very dense trail of ionization; the atom is typically a heavy metal, which preferentially collect on the chromosomes. In some studies, this has resulted in an RBE approaching 1,000 instead of the value used in governmental regulations. The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is radon, a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock. If the gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung. These particles continue to \n\n Naturally occurring krypton in Earth's atmosphere is composed of five stable isotopes, plus one isotope (78Kr) with such a long half-life (9.2×1021 years) that it can be considered stable. (This isotope has the second-longest known half-life among all isotopes for which decay has been observed; it undergoes double electron capture to 78Se). In addition, about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are known. Traces of 81Kr, a cosmogenic nuclide produced by the cosmic ray irradiation of 80Kr, also occur in nature: this isotope is radioactive with a half-life of 230,000 years. Krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near-surface water, but 81Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) groundwater. 85Kr is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half-life of 10.76 years. It is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium, such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors. 85Kr is released during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors. Concentrations at the North Pole are 30% higher than at the South Pole due to convective mixing.\n\n Naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive isotopes; (from the radioactive family of ) and  (a granddaughter of ). decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been identified, the most stable being with a half-life of 21.772 years, actinium-225 with a half-life of 10.0 days and  with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which \n\nQuestion: Which radioactive substance sometimes occurs naturally in spring water?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The figure Alfraganus used based on these measurements was 56 2/3 miles, giving an Earth circumference of 20400 mi. In contrast to his predecessors who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048) developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top which yielded simpler measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location. Al-Biruni's method's motivation was to avoid \"walking across hot, dusty deserts\" and the idea came to him when he was on top of a \n\n circumference of the Earth 40,000 kilometres. In order to measure this distance accurately, the French Academy of Sciences commissioned Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain to lead an exhibition to attempt to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in Dunkerque and Montjuïc castle in Barcelona to estimate the length of the meridian arc through Dunkerque. The length of the first prototype metre bar was based on these measurements, but it was later determined that its length was short by about 0.2 millimetres because of miscalculation of the flattening of the Earth, making the prototype about 0.02% shorter than the original proposed definition of the metre. Regardless, this length became the French standard and was progressively adopted by other countries in Europe. This is why the polar circumference of the Earth is actually 40,008 kilometres, instead of 40,000.\n\n  Abu Rayhan Biruni (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute Earth's circumference, by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for Earth's circumference. His estimate of 6,339.6 km for Earth's radius was only 31.4 km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0 km. In contrast to his predecessors, who measured Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top. This yielded more accurate measurements of Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location. Biruni's method was intended to avoid \"walking across hot, dusty deserts\", and \n\n calculate Earth's circumference to within 7920 km of the correct value of around 40000 km, and possibly as accurately as 180 km. The rate of change in the angle blocked by Earth as altitude increases would be different for a disk than for a sphere. The amount of surface blocked would be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, but this is not observed. Surveys from all over Earth show that its shape is everywhere locally convex, confirming that it is very close to spherical.\n\n Earth's circumference is the distance around Earth. Measured around the Equator, it is 40075.017 km. Measured around the poles, the circumference is 40007.863 km. Measurement of Earth's circumference has been important to navigation since ancient times. The first known scientific measurement and calculation was done by Eratosthenes, who achieved a great degree of precision in his computation. Treated as a sphere, determining Earth's circumference would be its single most important measurement. Earth deviates from spherical by about 0.3%, as characterized by flattening. In modern times, Earth's circumference has been used to define fundamental units of measurement of length: the nautical mile in the seventeenth century and the metre in \n\nQuestion: What is the approximate circumference of the earth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its primary focus was coordinating \"international research on global-scale and regional-scale interactions between Earth's biological, chemical and physical processes and their interactions with human systems.\" The International Council of Scientific Unions, a coordinating body of national science organizations, launched IGBP. It looked at the total Earth system, the changes that are occurring, and the manner in which changes are influenced by human actions. IGBP aimed to describe and understand how the physical, chemical and biological processes regulate the Earth system.

The aerial high point and finish is an \"eagle's nest\", 35 metres high, from where there are good views over the biosphere reserve. To return to the ground there is a 45 metre long slide. In its first 3 years 467,000 people experienced the walkway. The Water Experience Path (Wasser-Erlebnis-Weg) was opened in 2006. The ca. 2 kilometre long route along the Saarbach comprises 14 stations, at which various aspects of water are presented, e.g. hydropower, water creatures and water quality. Also in 2006 the second floor of the main building of the Biosphere House was opened with an exhibition with an interactive history on the subject of waterbodies and stream valleys (Gewässer und Bachtäler).\n\nTesting CRP levels in the blood may be useful as way to assess cardiovascular disease risk, as elevated CRP levels are correlated with a higher incidence of coronary artery disease.C-reactive protein (CRP): An acute phase protein produced by the liver that increases during systemic inflammation.ATP (adenosine triphosphate): A nucleotide, produced by the mitochondria inside cells, that is responsible for the chemical energy that drives otherwise uphill biochemical reactions in the body. axons: A thin branch that transmits electrical impulses away from neurons (brain cells) to other neurons, muscles, or glands. bioflavonoids: Bioflavonoids are a class of water-soluble plant pigments that are naturally found in fruits and vegetables.

Once cadmium is absorbed it generally remains stored in the body for many years. Long-term exposure to cadmium is associated with kidney problems. High exposure can lead to obstructive lung disease and has been linked to lung cancer. Studies show that cadmium may also cause osteoporosis and other bone defects, as well as increased blood pressure and other health problems. The giant dark clouds of lead, mercury, and cadmium particles that have descended upon our precious and fragile world are a truly serious problem indeed—but the problem looms larger still. The Biosphere 2 Project\n\nFrom September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993 a courageous group of eight men and women—including the late UCLA longevity researcher Roy Walford—set off on a path of ecological discovery in the Oracle, Arizona desert called the Biosphere 2 project. This visionary project lead to the creation of the largest artificial, self-sustaining ecosystem ever built and was truly a masterpiece of human engineering. For two years and twenty minutes, inside a completely sealed, glass-enclosed 3.15 acre environment—composed of miniature replicas of all the earth's environments, and housing 3,800 species of plants and animals, designed to function together as a single system—these eight people had to grow all their own vegetables, raise all their own livestock, and live so that a hundred percent of their waste was recycled. In other words, the animals and plants in Biosphere 2 had to produce all of their own biological resources without polluting one another out of existence.

The project is based on the modular principle and is continually being developed: Originally the Biosphere House was a single-storey building that opened in March 2000 as an information centre for the biosphere reserve. An important part of the centre is a multi-faceted multimedia exhibition. In March 2002, two years after its opening, the nature experience centre (Naturerlebniszentrum) was added. This consists of an exhibition room with adjacent accommodation and a restaurant, as well as an interactive circular path. This is 1,500 metres long and has 14 way stations with interesting information about the region; it is also pram- and wheelchair-friendly.

Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from geologists. The former use it in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of gypsum and the fine-grained banded type of calcite. Geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type. Chemically, gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium, while calcite is a carbonate of calcium. The two types of alabaster have similar properties. They are usually lightly colored, translucent, and soft stones. They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts. The calcite type is also denominated \"onyx-marble\", \"Egyptian alabaster\", and \"Oriental alabaster\" and is geologically described as either a compact banded travertine or \"a stalagmitic limestone marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown\". \n\nA gypsum product refers to any material that is made primarily from gypsum, a soft mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate. Gypsum products are widely used in various industries, including construction, dentistry, and art. They are known for their versatility, durability, and fire-resistant properties. Some common examples of gypsum products include gypsum plaster, gypsum board (also known as drywall or plasterboard), and dental gypsum materials used for making molds and casts in dentistry. These products are essential in different applications, such as creating decorative finishes on walls and ceilings, constructing partitions, and fabricating dental restorations. The unique properties of gypsum make it a highly useful material in a variety of industries.\n\n Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula CaSO4*2H2O. It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk chalk, and drywall. A massive fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, has been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England. Gypsum also crystallizes as translucent crystals of selenite. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines gypsum as hardness value 2 based on scratch hardness comparison.\n\n Sticks of processed \"chalk\" are produced especially for use with blackboards in white and also in various colours. White chalk sticks are made mainly from calcium carbonate derived from mineral chalk rock or limestone, while coloured or pastel chalks are made from calcium sulphate in its dihydrate form, CaSO4·2H2O, derived from gypsum. Chalk sticks containing calcium carbonate typically contain 40–60% of CaCO3 (calcite).\n\nGypsum is a versatile material that finds its application in various industries. One of its primary uses is in the field of medicine for creating casts and dies. Gypsum casts are commonly used to immobilize fractured bones during the healing process. They help provide support and stability to the injured area, allowing the bone to heal properly. Gypsum is an ideal material for this purpose as it is lightweight, easy to work with, and can be molded to fit the specific shape and size of the patient's body part.\n\nGypsum is also utilized in dentistry for creating dental casts and dies. Dental casts are used to create accurate replicas of a patient's teeth and jaw, which are essential for procedures such as orthodontic treatment, prosthetic fabrication, and dental restoration. Gypsum dies, on the other hand, are used to produce precise and customized dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges.\n\nIn addition to the medical and dental field, gypsum is used in various other industries. It is commonly used in construction for making plaster of Paris, which is a type of gypsum plaster used for wall and ceiling finishes. Gypsum is also used in soil amendment to improve soil structure and enhance its fertility. Furthermore, it has applications in the production of fertilizers, cement, and even as a filler in certain food and pharmaceutical products.\n\nOverall, gypsum plays a crucial role in the medical field by allowing for the creation of casts and dies that aid in the healing and treatment of injuries. Its versatility extends beyond medicine, finding uses in construction, agriculture, and various other industries as well.\n\nQuestion: Which common mineral is used to make casts, moulds, blackboard chalk and plaster of Paris?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.\n\n photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light. In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"\n\n a (mostly) stationary aether (1892, 1895). However, in Lorentz's model the aether was completely immobile, like the electromagnetic aethers of Cauchy, Green and Maxwell and unlike Fresnel's aether. He obtained Fresnel's dragging coefficient from modifications of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, including a modification of the time coordinates in moving frames (\"local time\"). In order to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo \"length contraction\" by a factor of in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Lorentz' theory became the basis for much research in the next decade, and beyond. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory.\n\n cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?\" In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light. James Clerk Maxwell developed a model to explain electric and magnetic phenomena using the aether, a model that led to what are now called Maxwell's equations and the understanding that light is an electromagnetic wave. However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been carried out in the late 1800s like the Michelson–Morley experiment in an attempt to \n\n particle hypothesis of light—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted. By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in atomic theory, and thus quantum mechanics emerged. In 1926, Gilbert N Lewis termed the particles photons. QED models them as the electromagnetic field's messenger particles or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions. Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or electromagnetic, whose two theories misaligned. Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous. At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.

Yadav et al projected that the maximum structural sizes was somewhere around 260 h/Mpc, while others gave values of 70-130 h/Mpc. More recent calculations suggest values within 370 Mpc. However, U1.11 was twice as large as the presiding scale, and other structures are found that were larger than the said scale. (Some structures exceed the scale by a factor of 8, such as Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model.\n\n the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, cosmic microwave background radiation, is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand. Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations. Michael Rowan-Robinson emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: \"It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.\" Bondi and \n\n If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). Some versions of the multiverse hypothesis therefore provide a simple explanation for any fine-tuning. The multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the anthropic principle and has been of particular interest to particle physicists, because theories of everything do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. UNC-Chapel Hill professor Laura Mersini-Houghton claimed that the WMAP cold spot could provide testable empirical evidence for a parallel universe, but this was later refuted as the WMAP cold spot was found to be nothing more than a statistical artifact. Variants of this approach include Lee Smolin's notion of cosmological natural selection, the Ekpyrotic universe, and the Bubble universe theory.\n\n Stephen Hawking and Thomas Hertog proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today. On their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's \"fine-tuned\" physical constants, as the current universe \"selects\" only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.\n\n The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the CMB, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law. The theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location. These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine-structure \n\nQuestion: What is the name of the theory that the universe appears the same wherever and whenever viewed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? ; Firewalls: Does a firewall exist around a black hole? ; Final parsec problem: Supermassive black holes appear to have merged, and what appears to be a pair in this intermediate range has been observed, in PKS 1302-102. However, theory predicts that when supermassive black holes reach a separation of about one parsec, it would take billions of years to orbit closely enough to merge - more than the age of the universe. \n\n an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his hoop conjecture, which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference can be spun must be a black hole. As a tool to be used in both enterprises, astrophysics and theoretical physics, Thorne and his students have developed an unusual approach, called the \"membrane paradigm\", to the theory of black holes and used it to clarify the \"Blandford-Znajek\" mechanism by which black holes may power some quasars \n\n The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which photons that move on tangents to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. Their orbits would be dynamically unstable, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon. While light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon. For a Kerr black hole the radius of the photon sphere depends on the spin parameter and on the details of the photon orbit, which can be prograde (the photon rotates in the same sense of the black hole spin) or retrograde.\n\n The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can pass only inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred. As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass. At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are \n\n  A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking \n\nQuestion: From which areas of space can there be no escape?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two. During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools. Six hours and thirty-nine minutes after landing Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and Eagle was depressurized. Eagles hatch was opened at 02:39:33.

During the Apollo 11 mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969.

Bean made a precision landing of Apollo 12 within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 uncrewed lunar probe, which had landed in April 1967 on the Ocean of Storms.

Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later.

One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions, where the commander had never performed the spacewalk.

It has a higher density than the geologically dead Rhea, the largest inner moon, but lower than that of active Enceladus. While the majority of Dione's surface is heavily cratered old terrain, this moon is also covered with an extensive network of troughs and lineaments, indicating that in the past it had global tectonic activity. The troughs and lineaments are especially prominent on the trailing hemisphere, where several intersecting sets of fractures form what is called \"wispy terrain\". The cratered plains have a few large impact craters reaching 250 km in diameter. Smooth plains with low impact-crater counts are also present on a small fraction \n\n in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring, within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining fifty-nine, with mean diameters ranging from 4 to 213 km, are irregular satellites, whose orbits are much farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or debris from the breakup of such bodies after \n\n The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has 83 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings – of which only 13 have diameters greater than 50 kilometers – as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are \n\n  There are 80 known moons of Jupiter, not counting a number of moonlets likely shed from the inner moons. All together, they form a satellite system which is called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 76 known moons \n\n compounded by its retrograde orbit. The smaller moon Proteus would show a disk about half the size of the full Moon. Surprisingly, Neptune's small inner moons all cover, at some point in their orbits, more than 10′ in Neptune's sky. At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31′ for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7–13′; Thalassa, 8–14′; Despina, 14–22′; Galatea, 13–18′; Larissa, 10–14′; Proteus, 12–16′; Triton, 26–28′.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies. Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction. An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from \n\n Voids are affected by the way gravity causes matter in the universe to \"clump together\", herding galaxies into clusters and chains, which are separated by regions mostly devoid of galaxies, yet the exact mechanisms are subject to scientific debate. Astronomers have previously noticed that the Milky Way sits in a large, flat array of galaxies called the Local Sheet, which bounds the Local Void. The Local Void extends approximately 60 Mpc, beginning at the edge of the Local Group. It is believed that the distance from Earth to the centre of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc. The size of the Local Void was calculated due to an isolated dwarf galaxy located inside it. The bigger and emptier the void, the weaker its gravity, and \n\n the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.\n\n The stellar halo is a nearly spherical population of field stars and globular clusters. It surrounds most disk galaxies as well as some elliptical galaxies of type cD. A low amount (about one percent) of a galaxy's stellar mass resides in the stellar halo, meaning its luminosity is much lower than other components of the galaxy. The Milky Way's stellar halo contains globular clusters, RR Lyrae stars with low metal content, and subdwarfs. Stars in our stellar halo tend to be old (most are greater than 12 billion years old) and metal-poor, but there are also halo star clusters with observed metal content similar to disk stars. The halo stars of the Milky Way have an observed radial velocity dispersion of about 200 km/s and a low average velocity of rotation of about 50 km/s. Star formation in the stellar halo of the Milky Way ceased long ago.\n\n  The Solar System orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center.

Albert Einstein called this the equivalence principle, and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.\n\n this principle, a uniform gravitational field acts equally on everything within it and, therefore, cannot be detected by a free-falling observer. Conversely, all local gravitational effects should be reproducible in a linearly accelerating reference frame, and vice versa. Thus, gravity acts like a fictitious force such as the centrifugal force or the Coriolis force, which result from being in an accelerated reference frame; all fictitious forces are proportional to the inertial mass, just as gravity is. To effect the reconciliation of gravity and special relativity and to incorporate the equivalence principle, something had to be sacrificed; that something was the long-held classical assumption that our space obeys the laws of Euclidean geometry, e.g., that the Pythagorean theorem is true experimentally. Einstein \n\n General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in \n\nThe term \"theory of relativity\" refers to two theories formulated by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction.\n\nOn the other hand, general relativity, presented by Einstein in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational forces. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. General relativity has been successful in explaining phenomena such as the bending of light around massive objects like stars.\n\nIt is important to note that while \"relativity\" primarily refers to these two theories by Einstein, there is also Galilean relativity, which predates them. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion.\n\nThe term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other.\n\nReferences:\n- The theory of relativity , or simply relativity, refers specifically to two theories of Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.\n- However, \"relativity\" can also refer to Galilean relativity.\n- The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later general relativity) uses the principle of rela\n\n a more general geometry, pseudo-Riemannian geometry, to allow for the curvature of space and time that was necessary for the reconciliation; after eight years of work (1907–1915), he succeeded in discovering the precise way in which space-time should be curved in order to reproduce the physical laws observed in Nature, particularly gravitation. Gravity is distinct from the fictitious forces centrifugal force and coriolis force in the sense that the curvature of spacetime is regarded as physically real, whereas the fictitious forces are not regarded as forces. The very first solutions of his field equations explained the anomalous precession of Mercury and predicted an unusual bending of light, which was confirmed after his theory was published. These solutions are explained below.\n\nQuestion: Which force is nothing more than the bending of space and time?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.50. The distance to this star, as determined from an annual parallax shift of 19.06 mas, is around 171 light years. It is currently moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −21 km/s, and will come within 44.58 pc in about 685,000 years ago. This is an evolved G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G7IIIb Fe–1, where the suffix notation indicates an underabundance of iron found in the spectrum. At the age of 2.4 billion years it has become a red clump giant, meaning it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. It has an estimated 1.94 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating 44.7 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,017 K.\n\n Gamma Scuti, Latinized from γ Scuti, is a single, white-hued star in the southern constellation of Scutum. The apparent visual magnitude of 4.67 indicates this is a dim star but visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 10.21 mas as seen from Earth, this star is located about 319 light years from the Sun. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A2:V. At the age of 237 million years, it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 222 km/s. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. The star has an estimated 2.91 times the mass of the Sun and 4.1 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.\n\n UY Scuti (BD-12°5055) is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scutum. It is considered one of the largest known stars by radius and is also a pulsating variable star, with a maximum brightness of magnitude 8.29 and a minimum of magnitude 10.56. It has an estimated radius of 1708 solar radius, thus a volume nearly 5 billion times that of the Sun. It is approximately 2.9 kpc from Earth. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would at least engulf the orbit of Jupiter.\n\n Psi Capricorni, Latinized from ψ Capricorni, is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Capricornus. It is a yellow-white hued star that is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.13. The distance to this star is approximately 47.9 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +20 km/s. The closest approach to the Sun occurred some 467,000 years ago at a separation of 6.003 pc.

It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength between 490 and 520 nm, between the wavelengths of green and blue. In the subtractive color system, or CMYK color model, which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta and yellow. In the additive color system, or RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from grey. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light. Colors in the cyan color range are teal, turquoise, electric blue, aquamarine, and others described as blue-green.\n\n spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. This discovery was the foundation of additive colors, and of the RGB color model. He showed that it was possible to create magenta by combining red and blue light; to create yellow by mixing red and green light; and to create cyan, or blue-green, by mixing green and blue. He also found that it was possible to create virtually any other color by modifying the intensity of these colors. This discovery led to the system used today to create colors \n\n Humans are able to see an array of colours because light in the visible spectrum is made up of different wavelengths (from 380 to 760 nm). Our ability to see in colour is due to three different cone cells in the retina, containing three different photopigments. The three cones are each specialized to best pick up a certain wavelength (420, 530 and 560 nm or roughly the colours blue, green and red). The brain is able to distinguish the wavelength and colour in the field of vision by figuring out which cone has been stimulated. The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation. Primates are the only mammals with colour vision. The Trichromatic theory was proposed in 1802 by Thomas Young. According to Young, the human visual system is able to create any colour through the collection of information from the three cones. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected.\n\nYellow is not a primary color. In the traditional subtractive color model used in painting and printing, the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by blending or mixing other colors together. With the primary colors, it is possible to create a wide range of other colors by blending them together in different proportions. Yellow is not a primary color because it can be created by mixing red and green together. This is why, in the RGB (red, green, blue) additive color model used in digital devices and screens, yellow is created by combining red and green light.\n\n The RGB color model, invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a computer monitor or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary–secondary combinations are red–cyan, green–magenta, and blue–yellow. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray. In some other color models, such as the HSV color space, the neutral colors (white, grays, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary colors (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the CIE 1931 color space a color of a \"dominant\" wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the complementary wavelength to produce a neutral color (gray or white).\n\nQuestion: What are the three primary colours of light?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Mantaro and Apurímac rivers join, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn meets the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, forming what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon.

The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus—some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogotá, Cali, Arequipa, Medellín, Bucaramanga, Sucre, Mérida, El Alto and La Paz.

Helium-4 is created by radiogenic production (by decay of uranium/thorium-series elements). The continental crust has become enriched with those elements relative to the mantle and thus more He4 is produced in the crust than in the mantle.

It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust. Nearly all of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas. The name \"argon\" is \n\nHelium is an inert gas and is the second lightest element in the periodic table. It has a variety of properties that make it unique. Firstly, helium is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, which means that it does not have any distinctive smell, taste, or color. It is also a non-toxic gas, which makes it safe to use in various applications.\n\nOne of the most well-known properties of helium is its low density. This gas is lighter than air, which enables objects to float in air when filled with helium. This property makes helium useful for filling balloons and airships. \n\nAnother important property of helium is its high thermal conductivity. Helium is an excellent conductor of heat and is used in various cooling applications, including cooling nuclear reactors and MRI machines. Due to its unique ability to conduct heat, helium is also used in cryogenics to cool superconducting magnets in particle accelerators and other research equipment. \n\nHelium has a low boiling point, which is one of the reasons why it is commonly used as a coolant. It remains a gas, even at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. This property makes helium suitable for use in various cryogenic applications, such as cooling superconducting materials and liquefying gases.\n\nIn terms of its chemical properties, helium is an unreactive element and is considered inert. It does not readily form compounds with other elements, which is why it is often referred to as a noble gas. This inert nature of helium makes it valuable for use in welding and other applications where non-reactivity is desired.\n\nOverall, helium has several unique properties, including its low density, high thermal conductivity, low boiling point, and inert nature. These properties make it useful in various industries and applications, from balloons to scientific research.\n\n Helium (from ἥλιος) is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting point are the lowest among all the elements. Helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe (hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant). It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and in \n\nQuestion: What is the second lightest chemical element?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The circumference of a circle is.\n\n This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of Conon of Samos. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an approximation of the value of pi, showing that it is greater than 223⁄71 and less than 22⁄7.\n\n Muramatsu Shigekiyo (村松 茂清) was a Japanese mathematician and curator in the Edo period. He is known for being the first to calculate the volume of a sphere using very thin slices, and to use inscribed and circumscribed polygones to approximate the circumference of a circle, and hence π. And by using a 32768-gon, he calculated its perimeter as 3.141592648... He published his value of pi to 22 decimal places in his 1663 book Sanso (Stack of mathematics), but only 8 were correct. Later, in 1681, Seki Takakazu used the same method with a 131072-gon, and got pi correct to 11 decimal places.\n\nMādhava's sine table constructed by 14th century Kerala mathematician-astronomer Mādhava of Saṅgama·grāma employs the Kaṭapayādi system to enlist the trigonometric sines of angles. ; Karaṇa·paddhati, written in the 15th century, has the following śloka for the value of pi (π) Transliteration anūnanūnnānananunnanityai ; ssmāhatāścakra kalāvibhaktoḥ ; caṇḍāṃśucandrādhamakuṃbhipālair It gives the circumference of a circle of diameter, anūnanūnnānananunnanityai (10,000,000,000) as caṇḍāṃśucandrādhamakuṃbhipālair (31415926536).

This resulted in the fragrance Un Jardin en Méditerranée, commissioned through Ellena's employer at the time, German fragrance firm Symrise. The next brief in the series called for a fragrance on the theme of \"river\". Its development represented a turning point for Hermès and the perfume industry as a whole. Ellena came on board as an in-house perfumer, reflecting a rise in the marketing of the artist behind the scent: just before joining Hermès, Ellena had created L'Eau d'Hiver for Éditions de Parfum Frédéric Malle, which distinguished itself as the first company to place the perfumer's name on the bottle, positioning the brand as \n\n The perfume's concentration is eau de toilette. Inspired by Ellena’s walk through a grove of mango trees with green fruit in an island garden on the Nile (a scouting trip in search of possible ingredients around which to construct the fragrance), the final version of Jardin sur le Nil contains notes of green mango, lotus, hyacinth, grapefruit, bulrush, calamus, sycamore, and incense. It was marketed as a unisex scent and continued to draw \"best of\" recommendations as a fragrance for men and women years after its first release, particularly for wear in the summer. In the Los Angeles Times, Denise Hamilton described it as \"The fragrance that catapulted green mango into the olfactory mainstream\" with a \"mouth-watering tart fruit note set noses everywhere aquiver.\" The perfume’s green-tinted glass bottle was also inspired by the green mango.\n\n In 2015, Vodianova was photographed by Steven Meisel for the 2015 Pirelli Calendar; this was her fourth appearance in Pirelli since 2003. She returned as the face of Calvin Klein's Euphoria fragrance shot by Inez and Vinoodh, ten years since her first exclusive contract with Calvin Klein. Vice President of Calvin Klein Fragrances, Coty Inc, Friedemann Schmid, commenting on her return to the brand, said \"Natalia Vodianova truly embodies the sensual glamour and sophistication of the Euphoria woman\".

Since 2005, bingo halls have seen a marked decline in revenues and the closure of many halls. The number of bingo clubs in Britain has dropped from nearly 600 in 2005 to under 400 as of January, 2014. These closures are blamed on high taxes, the smoking ban, and the rise in online gambling, amongst other things. Bingo played in the UK (90-ball bingo) is not to be confused with bingo played in the US (75-ball bingo), as the tickets and the calling are slightly different. In Quebec, this game is called Kinzo. In India, it is known as Tambola.\n\n In the game of bingo in the United Kingdom, callers announcing the numbers have traditionally used some nicknames to refer to particular numbers if they are drawn. The nicknames are sometimes known by the rhyming phrase 'bingo lingo' and there are rhymes for each number from 1 to 90, some of which date back many decades. In some clubs the 'bingo caller' will say the number, with the assembled players intoning the rhyme in a call and response manner, in others, the caller will say the rhyme and the players chant the number. In 2003, Butlins holiday camps introduced some more modern calls devised by a Professor of Popular Culture in an attempt to bring fresh interest to bingo. Since the introduction of the electronic random number generator (RNG) in bingo halls in the UK, the usage of the nicknames or bingo calls above in mainstream bingo has dramatically decreased.\n\nQuestion: What number in Bingo is sometimes referred to as Heinz varieties?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today. \"God save our gracious Queen!Long live our noble Queen!God save The Queen!Send her victoriousHappy and gloriousLong to reign over usGod save the Queen!

In Wales, \"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau\" is sometimes accompanied by the hymn, \"Guide Me, O thou Great Redeemer\" (also referred to as \"Bread of Heaven\" from repeated words in its first verse), especially at rugby matches. ; Northern Ireland currently uses \"God Save the Queen\" but previously used \"Danny Boy/Londonderry Air\". The United Kingdom's national anthem is \"God Save the Queen\" but its constituent countries and Crown Dependencies also have their own national anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, each has a number of anthems which are played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. \n\nNot on this land alone ; But be God's mercies known ; From shore to shore. ; Lord, make the nations see ; That we in liberty ; Should form one family ; The wide world o'er. \"God Save the Queen\" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was added as a second. \"God Save the Queen\" is now most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day. The Māori-language version was written by Edward Marsh Williams under the title, \"E te atua tohungia te kuini\". There is a special New Zealand verse in English which was once commonly sung to replace the second and third verses:\n\n \"Advance Australia Fair\" is the national anthem of Australia. Written by Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" was reinstated in January 1976, with \"Advance Australia Fair\", returning in 1984. This followed a plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family. The 1984 version of \"Advance Australia Fair\" has lyrics modified from McCormick's original and verses trimmed down from four to two. In January 2021 the lyrics were changed again.\n\n melody was also used for the national anthem 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918 and as \"The Prayer of Russians\", the imperial anthem of Russia from 1816 to 1833. In Switzerland, it is known as \"Rufst du, mein Vaterland\". Beyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders.

The Iron Cross was established in 1813 during the war against Napoleon I as a decoration for courageous common soldiers. It was renewed in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and in World War I. It also appeared in the canton of the war flag of the German Empire. The royal standard of Prussia showed the Iron Cross charged with the shield and crown of the small state arms surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Black Eagle.

This was officially recorded in the 1906 revision of the Convention. However, according to jurist and Red Cross historian Pierre Boissier, no clear evidence of this origin has been found; the concept that the design was chosen to complement the country in which the convention at which it was adopted was held, was also promoted later to counter the objections of Turkey that the flag was a Christian symbol.\n\nQuestion: What colour is the cross on the national flag of Switzerland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stalin hoped to prevent the creation of a western German state aligned with the U.S., or, failing that, to consolidate control over eastern Germany. After the blockade began on June 24, 1948, the commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this \n\n Churchill, to discuss relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Participants included Churchill, US president Dwight D. Eisenhower and French premier Joseph Laniel. In 1957 a second summit conference was held. The British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to demonstrate they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the Suez Canal. Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President John F. Kennedy. The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from construction of the Berlin Wall.

The first team to reach zero advances to the Final Throw.\n\n After each of the first three rounds, the professionals face each other in a standard game of darts; the first to count down from 501 to zero wins, scoring 10 points for their team, and a double is required to close out. A team earns a bonus of £500 or £1,000 for a score of 180 or a nine-dart finish by their professional, respectively. The team keeps these bonuses regardless of the final outcome of the game.\n\n The player competes in 501 darts against other darts players waiting in a championship tournament with normal darts rules applying, subtracting your score from 501 to zero whilst finishing on a double. Beginning at the quarter finals, the player must win a best of three match to advance through the tournament. Win another match in the semi final stage to advance to the final and face the World Champion Jammy Jim. In the final match however, the player needs to win just one leg against him to win the tournament.

Each shot consists of exactly three darts, and 60 is the maximum that can be scored with any one dart. Thus 180 is the maximum score from a shot, and nine throws are the minimum necessary to win.

Although playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as \"doubling in\", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's World Grand Prix uses this format. The minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common nine-dart finish consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat.

The Scottish Cup was first competed for in the 1873–74 season. Football in Scotland did not become a professional sport until the 1890s. This meant that clubs in this early period were generally organised by a management committee, or a board of directors if the club had been incorporated. The position of team manager was not introduced in Scottish football until the 1890s, or even later in some instances. Willie Maley, with Celtic in 1899, was the first team manager to win the competition. This list gives details of the winning club and their manager in each season since then. Maley is also the most successful manager in the history of the competition, winning 14 Scottish Cups during his long tenure.\n\n and the League Cup once. In European competition, teams such as Juventus, Porto, Valencia, and Barcelona all visited Glasgow to face Celtic and returned home defeated. He led Celtic to their first European final in 33 years, albeit losing narrowly after extra time. Celtic also commenced an unbeaten run of 77 home matches, which spanned from 2001 to 2004 and notched up an SPL record for the most consecutive wins in a single season. His win percentage of 75% is the highest of any manager in the clubs history. In conclusion, O'Neill's tenure as manager at Celtic was the club's most successful period since the time of Jock Stein.\n\n The 1966–67 season of the European Cup Winners' Cup club football tournament was won by Bayern Munich in a final victory over Rangers, who had eliminated holders Borussia Dortmund. It was the fourth time in six years that the final required at least extra time to decide the winners.\n\n Celtic Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Glasgow, which has regularly taken part in European competitions since its first appearance in the 1962–63 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Since then, the club has competed in every UEFA organised competition, with the exception of the UEFA Super Cup and the defunct Intertoto Cup. The club became the first British team and only Scottish team to date to win the European Cup, by beating Inter Milan in the 1967 final. The team that defeated Inter at the final held at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon have since become known as \"The Lisbon Lions\". During the 1960s, Celtic also twice reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup before \n\n Celtic are the only team to have won the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League), Europe's premier competition. Celtic won this cup in 1967 becoming the first British team to do so. Their victory is an important one in football history with the competition being won with a team comprising no players born more than thirty miles (48 km) from the home of the club, Celtic Park. The most successful teams over the years have been the Old Firm: Rangers and Celtic. With Rangers having won more major trophies than any other team in professional football. Glasgow is therefore home to three major football stadia. With Celtic Park (60,411 seats), Ibrox Stadium (50,817 seats) and Hampden Park (51,866 seats).\n\nQuestion: What was the first British football team to win the European Cup?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Fairbanks is the only large city in the region. Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain in North America, and is also located here.\n\n Denali State Park is a 325,240 acres State Park in Alaska [1](Alaska). It is located on the south eastern border of Denali National Park and Preserve formerly known as Mt. McKinley National Park, a much larger and more popular park in the area. Denali State Park is in the southern portion of Alaska. Denali State Park is situated between Fairbanks and Anchorage Alaska. Alaska’s Highway 3, George Parks Highway, connects Fairbanks and Anchorage and runs directly through Denali State Park. This highway provides access to many different hiking routes and look out points which allow visitors to see Denali and many different parts of the natural environment only found in Alaska. One of these points include Kesugi Ridge in the Peters Hills area. A very popular trail which is known for its incredible views of the Alaska Range and \n\n around it. The Alaska Range runs just north of Denali State Park and inside of Denali National Park, making the national park a more well known tourist destination. Denali State Park is in sight of Mount Denali. Denali is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation 20,310 feet above sea level. Since it rises roughly 18000 ft base to peak it is the largest mountain situated entirely above sea level. To the east, the state park borders the Susitna River, which feeds into the Gompertz Channel near Anchorage, then into the ocean. There are several other rivers in the park and the surrounding area which are visited by tourists. Denali State Park is home to many different terrains, animals, plants, and opportunities to safely and respectfully enjoy these parts of a natural wild environment.\n\n are many different views of Alaska looking in either direction. The tundra on the surrounding plateau of the ranges and in the park offer a unique environment for plants and animals. This terrain also offers many small lakes which are easy to hike to and visit. Following regularly used trails will allow visitors to view many of the park's natural beauties during their trip. Rivers in the area allow for clearwater canoeing and rapids for various levels of canoers and kayakers. This area is also known for its salmon fishing during season.

Visitors are attracted to Alaska by various experiences often tied to the natural and vast characteristics of the landscape, wildlife, and culture of the state. There are many guided activities that provide a way for visitors to access these experiences and for local and multi-national companies alike to conduct business. Guided activities include sightseeing tours, whale watching, glacier viewing, flightseeing, wildlife viewing, hiking, ziplining, kayaking/rafting, and fishing. Fishing alone accounts for $652,498,723 in annual spending by non-residents including purchases of licenses, guides, equipment, and repair. A top destination for tourism in Alaska includes the State's National Park system, featuring 24 units. Annually these national parks collectively are visited by 2.6 million people and contribute a $1.1 billion economic benefit.\n\nQuestion: What is the most popular natural attraction in Alaska?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist. In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.\n\nThe oxygen transport mechanisms between larval and adult amphibians differ in several key aspects. \n\nFirstly, in aquatic amphibians, the exchange of gases from the blood to the surrounding water primarily occurs through their skin. This is in contrast to terrestrial amphibians, which rely on lungs for gas exchange. \n\nSecondly, larval and adult amphibians have different hemoglobin compositions. No globin chains are shared between larval and adult amphibians. Adult hemoglobin starts appearing in frogs during tail regression and becomes the only hemoglobin found three weeks after metamorphosis. Adult amphibians generally have higher hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes (PCVs) compared to larval forms.\n\nThirdly, during metamorphosis, there are changes in the phosphate regulation of hemoglobin in adult amphibians compared to larval forms. Metamorphosis in newts and salamanders may not result in a transition in hemoglobin affinity like in frogs and toads. However, when newts and salamanders switch from aquatic to aerobic respiration at metamorphosis, both larval and adult hemoglobins exhibit the same affinity for oxygen. The reduced oxygen affinity of the blood in adult amphibians is often achieved by an increased erythrocyte concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\nLastly, toads, which primarily rely on aerobic respiration, tend to have higher hemoglobin and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations and lower blood oxygen affinity compared to frogs, which primarily rely on anaerobic respiration.\n\nThese differences in oxygen transport mechanisms reflect the varying physiological adaptations amphibians undergo during their life cycle and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.\n\nPost-metamorphic changes in activity metabolism of anuran species, such as frogs and toads, are influenced by several factors, particularly in relation to their life histories. The length of the larval stage and the size of a frog at metamorphosis are significant factors in the ontogenetic changes that occur after metamorphosis.\n\nSpecies like Bufo americanus (American toads) and Rana sylvatica (wood frogs) have relatively short larval periods of 2-3 months and metamorphose at smaller body masses of 0.25 g or less. These species exhibit rapid improvements in endurance and aerobic capacity during the period immediately following metamorphosis. This increase in performance is associated with changes in oxygen transport capacity, including increases in hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and heart mass relative to body mass.\n\nOn the other hand, species like Rana clamitans (green frogs) spend longer periods as larvae (3-10 months) and weigh more (3 g) at metamorphosis. Green frogs do not show immediate post-metamorphic increases in performance compared to toads and wood frogs.\n\nSpecies like Rana palustris (pickerel frogs) fall between wood frogs and green frogs in terms of larval duration and size at metamorphosis. They also exhibit intermediate post-metamorphic physiological changes.\n\nThe timing of dispersal from their natal ponds also differs among these species. American toads and wood frogs tend to delay dispersal, allowing them to undergo rapid growth and development after metamorphosis. On the other hand, green frogs disperse as soon as they leave the water, even before fully absorbing their tails.\n\nThe smaller body sizes of newly metamorphosed toads and wood frogs impose limitations on their behaviors. Their brief larval periods allow them to take advantage of transient aquatic habitats but restrict their activities during the post-metamorphic phase.\n\nIn summary, the post-metamorphic changes in activity metabolism of anuran species are influenced by factors such as the length of the larval stage, size at metamorphosis, and species-specific life history traits. These factors play a role in shaping the physiological changes and behavioral patterns observed after metamorphosis.\n\n A true toad is any member of the family Bufonidae, in the order Anura (frogs and toads). This is the only family of anurans in which all members are known as toads, although some may be called frogs (such as harlequin frogs). The bufonids now comprise more than 35 genera, Bufo being the best known.\n\n The order Anura (from the Ancient Greek a(n)- meaning \"without\" and oura meaning \"tail\") comprises the frogs and toads. They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them, shorter forelimbs, webbed toes with no claws, no tails, large eyes and glandular moist skin. Members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs, while those with warty skins are known as toads. The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule. Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the \"true toads\". Frogs range in size from the 30 cm Goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of West Africa to the 7.7 mm Paedophryne amauensis, first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012, which is also the smallest known vertebrate. Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live \n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a frog and a toad?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cards are played out to form a layout of sequences going up and down in suit from the agreed starting card (e.g. a Seven or an Unter). The game is won by the player who is first to empty their hand. The game is a cross between dominoes and patience and is suitable for children who have learnt the various card values.\n\n of a second box, cards or dominoes can be used to represent tiles 13–24. A Double 12 Dominoes set can also be used with four dice for this variant and other domino sets can be used by themselves to, in the case of the Double 18 set, provide for the use of six dice by themselves without the counting box. ; Thai style (Jackpot) – Always roll two dice, but only cover one tile matching one of the dice or their sum.

Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Texas 42 is a domino game more similar in its play to a \"trick-taking\" card game. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles. Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four \n\n tiles have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle. The traditional domino set contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the \"double six\"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided dice, but because blank ends having no spots are used, seven faces are possible, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set. However, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are \"extended\" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots, \n\n Dominoes is a family of tile-based games played with gaming pieces, commonly known as dominoes. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends. Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called pips or dots) or is blank. The backs of the tiles in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a deck or pack.

Instead, the National Police Foundation conducts and translates scientific research, training, technical assistance and evaluation to advance policing. In the United Kingdom, the Police Foundation (UK) describes itself as \"the UK's policing think tank\". In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) partnered with the Target Corporation to hold a series of training workshops around the U.S. to \"provide business leaders, elected officials, police chiefs, and foundation board members and staff with the basic tools to establish and grow a police foundation\". These workshops were conducted by representatives of the New York City Police Foundation.\n\n On August 18, 2011, the Secretary General of INTERPOL, Ronald K. Noble, announced that Elliott will be appointed to a three-year term as Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations, effective November 21, 2011. He previously served as a Delegate for the America's with INTERPOL's Executive Committee. Elliott's responsibilities will include working to facilitate and enhance co-operation between INTERPOL and the United Nations and its agencies on matters of terrorism, transnational organized crime and international police cooperation. As head of INTERPOL's UN office, the Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations assists both organizations to develop key INTERPOL-UN partnerships to combat international crime and works with senior officials at the UN to identify resource-sharing opportunities.\n\n The policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \"tantamount to abduction\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\".\n\n  The National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet, previously Kriminalpolitisentralen), commonly known as Kripos, is a special agency of the Norwegian Police Service. Based at Bryn in Oslo and established in 1959, it is a national unit that works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assisting unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, and is responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. It is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. Kripos represents four percent of the Norwegian police force, with nearly 500 employees.\n\n The idea of the organization known today as Interpol was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is \"\"Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters\".

In the past 50 years of spaceflight, more than 400 people have flown in space, but only 26 have been American physicians. In 1973, Dr. Joseph Kerwin was the first U.S. physician selected for astronaut training, serving as the Science Pilot for the Skylab2 mission to the first U.S. orbital space station. Like Dr. Kerwin, when physicians have flown, they have served as scientists, engineers, spacewalkers, and project managers. Rarely has a physician-astronaut served as the on-board medical provider.\nJapanese astronaut Koichi Wakata performs an ultrasound scan using the Human Research Facility (HRF) Ultrasound2 on Expedition 38.\nSurprisingly, few serious medical emergencies in space have been reported. While documented conditions have included urosepsis, renal colic, cellulitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmia, only 17 of these nonfatal severe medical events have been reported during spaceflight between 1961-1999.1 The relatively benign nature of medical problems in space flight is likely due to shorter missions, selection of healthy astronauts, on-board medications, and countermeasures to environmental effects and prolonged microgravity.2 The comprehensive profiling process includes an evaluation of astronauts' physiological and psychosocial well-being, medical history, and extensive laboratory and genetic markers. Astronauts also undergo simulations and classroom activities to prepare for these missions and the extraordinary events they may encounter.\nWhen emergencies have occurred, they have been managed by both Earth-based medical teams and the assigned crew medical officer on board. The training of the crew medical officer includes limited medical instruction (less than 60 hours of training) and minor surgical skills such as suturing.2 That being said, medical kits on board include a large variety of supplies and medications, from stool softeners and Foley catheters to antipsychotics and tracheostomy tubes. Astronauts are additionally faced with the challenges of medical resuscitation in a microgravity environment, where usual physiologic conditions and advanced life support protocols may not even be relevant.\nThus, the medical training of physician-astronauts will become a valuable asset as plans for increased space travel and extended duration missions become reality. Furthermore, the physician with a background in emergency medicine seems ideally suited for such endeavors.\nMae Jemison, MD, (a general practitioner) floats in zero gravity at the Spacelab Japan Science module aboard STS-105, Endeavour.\nWith recent aerospace successes, such as the launch of the Orion spacecraft in December 2014, the Curiosity mission in Mars, and unmanned missions to comets and asteroids, the future of space flight seems promising. Plans for commercial space flight to the International Space Station (ISS), interplanetary expeditions, a return to the moon, colonization of neighboring planets, and establishment of bases are underway. Extended time in space inevitably leads to questions on how the Human Space Flight (HSF) program can support in-flight emergencies, particularly when a return to Earth may not be practical. For example, one study estimates that the risk of an emergency medical event during a 7-member space flight to Mars would be about 1 emergency event per trip. This may seem negligible until put in the context of a 6-month return to Earth.1,3 Thus, the capability to administer advanced care for illness and injury will undoubtedly be a prerequisite for interplanetary travel and prolonged human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.2 Additionally, as space vehicles move further from Earth's orbit, telemetric medical support and traditional communication traveling at the speed of light will have a longer delay (eg, in the case of Mars, two-way radio contact will require a minimum of 44 minutes).2 Given such delays, the current practice of relying on Earth-based medical consultation and a crew medical officer without extensive medical training may no longer be enough.\nThe preparation for medical emergencies in future missions will require using experience from previous missions, submarines expeditions, remote habitats, stations in extreme environments like Antarctica, and simulations. Other medical events unique to space also must be anticipated, particularly higher incidence of space radiation, injuries from increased extravehicular activities, space debris, and increased susceptibility for infection.\nAstronaut Luca Parmitano collects fundoscopic images with the help of astronaut Chris Cassidy for the Ocular Health experiment.\nFuture space travelers are unlikely to be as fit and healthy as past astronauts, adding to the likelihood of increased medical incidents in space. As NASA redirects its scope beyond low Earth orbit, the goal of commercial space travel is being pursued by private agencies. Despite the fatal October 2014 crash of Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo, Virgin continues with the development of a vehicle for customers wishing to undertake suborbital travel. The ISS medical community has issued standards for spaceflight participants (“space tourists”) to the station. The Federal Aviation Administration has also issued regulations on operating space taxis, including general security, training, and minimum health restrictions for potential customers. Despite these restrictions, the space tourist will be less healthy and less equipped to handle emergencies than previous space travelers who spent years preparing for a mission.\nAlthough a Soyuz spacecraft docked on the ISS can be used for evacuation today, space emergency medical systems and emergency departments may soon adopt more visible roles as more tourists fly and as extended missions become a reality. International space agencies will need to provide advanced medical care for acute illness and injury and manage the safe return of astronauts.\nOnly 5 EM-trained American physician-astronauts have flown in space: Thomas Marshburn, MD; Anna Fisher, MD; William Hendrick Fisher, MD; Scott Parazynski, MD; and Kjell Lindgren, MD.4 The emergency medicine training experience has many qualities that make emergency physicians the best potential medical providers for the future of human space flight: comfort with rapid assessment and treatment, resuscitation expertise, ability to perform a wide range of advanced procedures, exposure to diverse pathologies, and creativity in resource limited settings. Given that the models for extended missions are based in part on experience from extreme environments and remote settings, training in wilderness medicine will also complement the skillset necessary for future space endeavors.\nAstronaut Franklin R. Chang-Diaz performs an eye exam on astronaut Ellen S. Baker, MD, MPH, on the middeck of the Earth-orbiting space shuttle Atlantis.\nThe HSF program will be faced with many challenges in clinical management as space exploration progresses to longer missions, interplanetary travel, and extraterrestrial colonization. It is now suggested that a physician be included in every spaceflight crew on long-duration space flights in order to enhance mission safety.6 Physician-astronauts will be a valuable asset to these missions because of their adaptability to be scientists, engineers, managers, and clinicians who can manage space emergencies and provide long-term crew health monitoring. Because of the training and experience, emergency physicians seem the ideal clinical specialists for providing these medical services.\nSummers RL, et al. Emergencies in Space.

They announced a mid-December date for the contest. However, on 2 July 2019, Morley and Vanessa Ponce, the reigning Miss World, appeared on ITV's Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan. Morley officially announced that the pageant will be held on Saturday, 14 December 2019, at ExCeL London and that Miss World 2020 will be held in Thailand in order to celebrate Miss World's 70th anniversary. The 2019 opening ceremony was held in London on 20 November. Contestants then competed in a series of fast track events around London.\n\n is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing\". In 1951, Eric Morley organized the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, referred to it as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening \n\n Originally the Festival Bikini Contest, Miss World was organized by Eric Morley as a mid-century advertisement for swimwear at the Festival of Britain. Håkansson wore a bikini during the crowning ritual, after which she was condemned by the Pope, and some countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced with more modest swimwear. While bikinis were eventually reintroduced to Miss World, Håkansson remains the only winner to have received her crown while wearing a bikini.\n\n In 1951, Eric Morley organised a bikini contest as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations that he called the Festival Bikini Contest. The event was popular with the press, and was dubbed \"Miss World\" by the media. The swimsuit competition was intended as a promotion for the bikini which had only recently been introduced onto the market, and which was still widely regarded as immodest. When the 1951 Miss World pageant winner, Kerstin \"Kiki\" Hakansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, it added to the controversy. The pageant was originally planned as a Pageant for the Festival of Britain, but \n\n Europe, under de Waleffe, was first held at the Paris Opera with participants from 18 countries. The first contest under de Waleffe did not occur until February 1929. The contest was interrupted by the onset of World War II but was later re-established, after de Waleffe died, by Roger Zeiler and Claude Berr who founded the Mondial Events Organization (MEO). Most contestants won their respective national contests for Miss World & Miss Universe, and participated as supplemental training for their respective competitions. Berr died in 1981 and in 2003, Roger Zeiler sold the license for the pageant to Endemol France, part of the Dutch television production company Endemol.

Its opening changed the local area from a gentrified London suburb to industrial, with several works and units opening around Ferry Lane to the northwest. The Victoria line station opened on 1 September 1968. It was the only station on the line with any new structures above ground level. The station was re-sited by British Rail on 14 December 1981, to provide better interchange with the Underground station.\n\n \"up\" escalator. A second entrance at the east end includes the main Victoria line ticket hall, and is accessed via subways on each side of High Road just north of the junction with Seven Sisters Road. There are three Victoria line platforms at Seven Sisters: with one platform (platform 4) reserved for services which terminate at the station to return to the depot or reverse back into central London, although a connection is available for trains to continue to Walthamstow Central. The section of Victoria line between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park stations is the longest between adjacent stations in deep level tunnels on the London Underground network. During the planning phase of \n\n The Central London Rail Study of 1989 proposed standard (British Rail) structure gauge tunnels linking the existing rail network as the \"East–West Crossrail\", \"City Crossrail\", and \"North–South Crossrail\" schemes. The east–west scheme was for a line from Liverpool Street to Paddington/Marylebone with two connections at its western end linking the tunnel to the Great Western Main Line and the Metropolitan line on the Underground. The City route was shown as a new connection across the City of London linking the Great Northern Route with London Bridge. The north–south line proposed routing West Coast Main Line, Thameslink, and Great Northern trains through Euston and King's Cross/, then under the West End via, and Victoria towards  and. The report also recommended a number of other schemes including a \"Thameslink Metro\" route enhancement, and the Chelsea–Hackney line. The cost of the \n\n By the Railways Act 1921, the main line railway companies of Great Britain were grouped into four companies, effective at the beginning of 1923. The LSWR was now part of the Southern Railway. Due to the Waterloo & City's status as part of one of the \"Big Four\" railway companies, it was not taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) at the latter's formation in 1933, making the W&C the only tube railway in London not to fall under the control of the LPTB. Despite this anomaly, the line was included on most versions of the Underground map produced by the LPTB and its successors up until the line's absorption into the London Underground network in 1994. In 1934, the LPTB proposed that the Waterloo & City should have a new intermediate station at Blackfriars, connecting with the District line station there. They further proposed that the Waterloo & City line should be extended to Liverpool Street station and Shoreditch, the trains there continuing over the East London Railway to New Cross and New Cross Gate. It is not clear whether the scheme had been costed, but nothing came of it.\n\n refurbished externally in 2006 – it houses signalling equipment for the Victoria line. The Victoria line was built to give as many interchanges as possible with Underground and British Rail lines, with, wherever possible, cross-platform connection between different lines heading in the same direction. To this end, at Highbury & Islington the northbound Northern City Line platform was reallocated to the southbound Victoria line to give a direct link between the two southbound platforms; a new northbound platform was constructed for each line; the northbound running NCL tunnel was diverted to its new platform; and the southbound Victoria line tunnel was joined to the old northbound NCL tunnel.

In its entirety it premiered on MTV.com. The video also premiered as the 'New Joint' on BET's 106 & Park on March 20, 2008. The song peaked at No. 6. The video features the members of Danity Kane in a futuristic theme. The pink special effects are used to represent the setting of being within an actual heart. Throughout the video, choreography is done along with the music and the girls are shown in a futuristic room with screens of them performing the choreography, which they see while laying down on a futuristic bed.

The video was MTV's second-most played video for the week ending August 1, and remained a popular video on the channel for over two years. The video was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 2000 MVPA Awards, but lost to Foo Fighters' \"Learn to Fly\".

On 27 February 2000, it became the one-millionth video to be aired on MTV. It also opened MTV Classic in the UK and Ireland. The video marked the closing of MTV Philippines before its shutdown on 15 February 2010 at 11:49 PM. MTV co-founder Bob Pittman said the video \"made an aspirational statement.

The exchanges between the two are far from cordial: Sir Humphrey reproaches Vermine for his greed and ruthlessness, especially for his role in bankrupting a gentleman named Brookall. Vermine in turn notes that Sir Humphrey himself wronged Brookall in a more personal way, seducing, impregnating, and then abandoning the man's sister. Dryground expresses his remorse over his past actions; he says that his \"project\" in mortgaging his estate involves reparations to Brookall, and he proposes an arranged marriage between the \n\n The play deals with Larry Doyle, originally from Ireland, but who has adopted English cultural customs and manners to fit in in England and Tom Broadbent, his English business partner. They are civil engineers who run a firm in London. They go to Roscullen, where Doyle was born, to develop some land. Doyle has no illusions about Ireland while Broadbent is taken with the romance of the place. Broadbent, a lively man who is seemingly not always aware of the impression he makes, becomes a favourite of the people. Before the play is over, it is clear he will marry Nora Reilly, the woman waiting for Doyle (who is more than happy to let her go) and become the area's candidate for Parliament after Doyle refuses to stand. Doyle has also 'called in' all his loans given \"so easily\" to the locals against their homes and intends (as he had planned all along) to make the village into an amusement park. Another major character is the defrocked priest Peter (Father) Keegan, the political and temperamental opposite of Broadbent, becomes suspicious of him upon his arrival and warns the locals against him.\n\n The story takes place on February 14, 1895. It is about two gentlemen pretending to be people other than themselves. Interwoven in their storylines are two romance-stricken ladies, each possessing an unusual allegiance to the manliness of the name Ernest. London man-about-town Jack Worthing, who hides behind the name Ernest, is an aristocrat from the country with uncertain lineage. His friend, Algernon Moncrieff, is of moderate means and has also created an imaginary character, Bunbury. Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax, has caught the eye of Jack. Jack's ward in the country, Cecily Cardew, has caught the eye of Algernon. Lady Bracknell rules the roost with her heavy-handed social mores. The story begins in \n\n of the clergyman Dr. Chasuble (\"Metaphorically Speaking\"). Jack, meanwhile, has decided to put his life as Ernest behind him. He is forced to abandon his intention to declare that his brother Ernest has died in Paris by the presence of Algernon in the role of \"Ernest\", who threatens to expose Jack's double life if the latter doesn't play along. Lane, the valet, and Cecily's maid Effie, lament the way the upper classes make love so difficult (\"You Can't Make Love\"); as servants, they find it much easier together.

Hammer found that under certain conditions of vacuum and voltage he observed a blue glow around the positive pole in a vacuum bulb and a blackening of the wire and the inside of the glass bulb at the positive pole. Hammer's discovery was first called \"Hammer's Phantom Shadow,\" but when Edison patented the electric light bulb in 1883 this thermionic emission became known as the \"Edison Effect,\" and was patented on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031).

In order to measure this flow, he made a special bulb with a third electrode, to which he could attach an instrument to measure the current. He reasoned that if the current would flow between the two ends of the filament, it would also flow to this third electrode. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. \n\n filament for his new lamp, but this solution was not perfect. After being heated to incandescence for a few hours, carbon from the filament would be deposited on the inside walls of the bulb, turning it black. Hammer noticed the carbon seemed to be coming from the end of the filament that was attached to the negative terminal of the DC power supply, and seemed to be flying through the vacuum onto the walls of the bulb, a phenomenon that Edison observed in 1875. On February 13, 1880, Edison determined that not only was carbon flying through the vacuum, but that it carried a charge. That is, \n\n finance during his time at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; \"to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development.\" Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. The company became known as Consolidated Edison. Trask was an original trustee of the Edison Electric Light Company, the predecessor to the General Electric Company, being for many years a member of the executive committee. \n\n While working for the inventor Thomas Edison at Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Hammer was in charge of testing early electric light globes in 1880 through 1881. In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). The exclusion of air was essential to maximize the life of the filament.

As a result, the floor of the pulp and the furcation of the tooth is moved apically down the root. The underlying mechanism of taurodontism is the failure or late invagination of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, which is responsible for root formation and shaping causing an apical shift of the root furcation. The constriction at the amelocemental junction is usually reduced or absent. Taurodontism is most commonly found in permanent dentition although the term is traditionally applied to molar teeth. In some \n\n Bruxism, which is an abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterised by jaw clenching and tooth grinding, is also a causative factor in the development of dental issues, including tooth mobility. Although it cannot cause periodontium damage in itself, bruxism is known to be able to worsen attachment loss and tooth mobility if periodontal disease is already present. Moreover, the severity of tooth mobility caused by bruxism also varies depending on the teeth grinding pattern and intensity of bruxism. However, the tooth mobility is typically reversible and the tooth returns to normal level of mobility once the bruxism is controlled.\n\n Tooth affected by this condition has a higher risk of developing caries and periradicular pathology. The thin layer of the infolding enamel could be chipped off easily, providing entrance for microorganisms into the tooth canal. This can cause abscess formation, displacement of dental structures (i.e. teeth). Preventive measures should be taken.\n\nAcrophobia is a specific phobia characterized by an intense and irrational fear of heights. People with this phobia experience anxiety and distress when exposed to heights or situations where they perceive a risk of falling from a high place. This fear can vary in severity, with some individuals feeling anxious when standing on a balcony or looking out of a window on a tall building, while others may feel extreme panic even at the thought of being in high places.\n\nAcrophobia is a common phobia and can have a significant impact on a person's daily life. It can lead to avoidance of situations such as climbing stairs, crossing bridges, or riding elevators, which can limit their freedom and restrict their activities. Additionally, acrophobia can also cause physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom or panic attack.\n\nThe exact cause of acrophobia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of environmental, genetic, and psychological factors. Traumatic experiences or accidents involving heights can contribute to the development of this phobia. Some studies suggest that a predisposition to anxiety disorders or a family history of phobias may increase one's likelihood of developing acrophobia.\n\nTreatment for acrophobia often includes a combination of therapy techniques. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is commonly used and aims to help individuals overcome their fear by challenging negative thoughts and beliefs, gradually exposing them to heights in a controlled and supportive manner, and teaching relaxation techniques to manage anxiety. Virtual reality and exposure therapy are also effective approaches used to expose individuals to virtual height situations in a safe and controlled environment.\n\nIn conclusion, acrophobia is an intense and irrational fear of heights that can significantly impact a person's life. It is treatable through various therapy techniques, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy. If you or someone you know is struggling with acrophobia, it is recommended to seek professional help from a mental health specialist.\n\nThanatophobia is a term used to describe an intense and persistent fear of death. It is a specific phobia that can cause significant distress and impair an individual's daily functioning. People with thanatophobia often have an overwhelming fear of their own death or the death of loved ones. This fear may be triggered by thoughts of dying, witnessing death, or being in situations related to mortality, such as hospitals or funerals.\n\nSymptoms of thanatophobia can vary from person to person but may include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, nausea, and a sense of impending doom. Individuals with this phobia may also experience intrusive thoughts or nightmares about death, leading to avoidance behaviors to circumvent situations or discussions related to death.\n\nThe exact causes of thanatophobia are not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a near-death experience, may also contribute to the development of this phobia.\n\nTreatment for thanatophobia typically involves a combination of therapy and, in some cases, medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is often used to help individuals challenge and reframe their irrational thoughts and beliefs about death. Exposure therapy may also be used, gradually exposing the person to feared death-related stimuli to reduce anxiety over time. Additionally, relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness, can be helpful in managing anxiety symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that if experiencing significant distress or impairment due to fear of death, it is advisable to seek professional help from a mental health provider, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. They can offer a personalized treatment approach and support to address the impact of thanatophobia on an individual's life.\n\nQuestion: Taphephobia is the fear of losing your teeth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He owned Bofors, a major armaments manufacturer, which he had redirected from its original business as an iron and steel mill. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life. Nobel's will expressed a request, to the surprise of many, that his money be used for prizes in physics, \n\n In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. One French newspaper condemned him for his invention of military explosives—not, as is commonly quoted, dynamite, which was mainly used for civilian applications—and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated, Le marchand de la mort est mort (\"The merchant of death is dead\"), and went on to say, \"Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.\" Nobel read the obituary and \n\n detonator in 1863, and in 1865 designed the blasting cap. On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful \n\n Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as \"dynamite\". Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance \"Nobel's Safety Powder\", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for \"power\" (δύναμις). Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, \n\n Alfred Bernhard Nobel (, ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24.

The city's economy accounts for most of the economic activity in both the states of New York and New Jersey. Manhattan is the world's leading center of banking, finance, and communication. It is home to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wall Street. Many of the world's largest corporations are headquartered in Manhattan. The borough contained over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2015, making it the largest office market in the United States. Midtown Manhattan, with nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) that same year, is the largest central business district in the world. New York City is distinctive for its high concentrations of \n\n in the early 20th century millions from Eastern Europe like Poland and Russia, both of Ashkenazi origin. In the late 20th century, a smaller wave of Russian Jews and Ukrainian Jews settled in the Brighton Beach section in Brooklyn, and New York has many Israeli-American residents. New York contains the largest Puerto Rican population in the contiguous United States, concentrated in parts of New York City such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. New York also has the largest Dominican population in the country, concentrated in New York City's Upper Manhattan and the Bronx. New York City is home to many with roots \n\n The demographics of Queens, the second-most populous borough in New York City, are highly diverse. No racial or ethnic group holds a 50% majority in the borough. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (behind Brooklyn), with approximately 2.3 million residents in 2013, approximately 48% of them foreign-born; Queens County is also the second most populous county in New York State, behind neighboring Kings County, which is coterminous with the borough of Brooklyn. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States; and if each New York City borough were an independent city, Queens would also be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Some say Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.\n\n Population New York State has a primarily urban population. The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn). The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the \n\n   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2010, New York was the third largest state in population after California and Texas, with a population of 19,378,102, an increase of over 400,000 people, or 2.1%, since the year 2000. The population change between 2000–2006 includes a natural increase of 601,779 people (1,576,125 births minus 974,346 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 422,481 people out of the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 820,388 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of about 800,213.

When Welsh culture adopted the name, it evolved into variations of traditionally Welsh names: Ieuan, Iowan, Ioan, Iwan, or even Siôn (note how the letter 'J' was originally being pronounced as 'i', akin to how J is pronounced in the Latin alphabet). The sound generated from ‘Si-‘ in Siôn is a Welsh approximation of the English ‘J’ sound that doesn’t exist natively to the language (refer to Irish Seán), equivalent to the English ‘Sh’ such as in “shed.” It may exist as an anglicisation of these names during periods in which many Welsh were changing their names and ridding their patronymic names (“Ap Rhys” to “Prys” and then “Price” in English, or attaching an ‘-s’ to the end of a given name to signify an old patronym: “Owain” to “Owen” to finally “Owens”), or English speakers transliterating these names to a more conventional spelling through mishearing. They may also come from the English patronymic “Johns,” or “Johnson” (“son of John”).\n\n The name was adopted into the Irish language most likely from Jean, the French variant of the Hebrew name Yohanan. As Gaelic has no letter J (a consonant derived from the vowel I that has not been adopted into all languages that use the Latin alphabet; English also lacked the J until the latter 17th Century, with John having previously been spelt Iohn), an S was substituted, as was the normal Gaelic practice in adapting Biblical names that in other languages contain J (Sine/Siobhàn for Joan/Jane/Anne/Anna; Seonaid/Sinéad for Janet; Seumas/Séamus for James; Seosamh/Seòsaidh for Joseph, and so on). In 1066, the Norman duke, William the Conqueror conquered England, where the Norman French name Jahan/Johan came to be pronounced Jean, and spelled \n\n This is a list of cities, towns, unincorporated communities, counties, and other places in the U.S. state of Arizona, which start with the letters I and J. This list is derived from the Geographic Names Information System, which has numerous errors, so it also includes many ghost towns and historical places that are not necessarily communities or actual populated places. This list also includes information on the number and names of counties in which the place lies, its lower and upper ZIP code bounds, if applicable, its U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reference number(s) (called the GNIS), class as designated by the USGS, and incorporated community located in (if applicable).\n\n The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound (acrophony), continue to be used to varying degrees in Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic. The names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and Z, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as Y Graeca \"Greek Y\" (pronounced I Graeca \"Greek I\") and zeta (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term zed for Z in all forms of English other than American English.

The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history. Tennis fans who were present at Armstrong Stadium to enjoy all the contests that day were able to do so on a single admission. When both Serena and Venus Williams made the tournament finals together for the first time in 2001, organizers switched the women's singles championship match to prime time to attract more television viewers. In the process, they also began charging separate admission for each of the two sessions on the last Saturday of the fortnight.\n\n On September7, 1979, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 30,000 viewers tuned in to witness the launch of ESPN. Simultaneously, ESPN debuted its first SportsCenter telecast with anchors Lee Leonard and George Grande. The first words spoken were from Leonard who informed viewers: \"If you're a fan, if you're a fan, what you'll see in the next minutes, hours, and days to follow may convince you you've gone to sports heaven.\" The first score Grande announced was Chris Evert's victory over Billie Jean King at the US Open. SportsCenter lasted a half-hour, consisting mainly of videotaped highlights. Following the conclusion of the telecast, the network aired a men's professional slow-pitch softball game from Lannon, Wisconsin with Joe Boyle working play-by-play, former Yankees \n\n NBC broadcast the game on station W2XBS with one camera and Bill Stern was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just one month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised sporting event. Sports broadcasting continued. Less than one month later (October 22) the now defunct Brooklyn \"Football\" Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–14, at Ebbets Field for the first televised professional football game. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game.

It was written by the Spice Girls, Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, whilst produced by the latter two. It was released as the only single from the album on 5 November 2007 by Virgin Records. The song was the first commercial single release to feature the group's original lineup since Geri Halliwell left in 1998. It was also the official Children in Need single of 2007. It is their last studio single to date. \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\" is a midtempo ballad song, which lyrically talks about the group reuniting, and about their friendship throughout two decades together. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it a \"classic\" from the group, while others \n\n As part of Virgin's strategy to make the group an international act, \"Wannabe\" was released in Japan and Southeast Asia two weeks before its British release. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as Space Shower. The single was released by Toshiba EMI on 26 June 1996, and sold 100,000 copies by October 1996. \"Wannabe\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number three, six days after its physical release, with sales \n\n intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was \n\n As the Spice Girls' debut single, \"Wannabe\" has been credited for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in \"Spicemania\" in the late 1990s. Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band. The Metro's Jon O’Brien concluded that: \"From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding in the space of just two minutes and 52 seconds.\" Digital Spy's Lewis Corner agreed, adding: \"It's hard to imagine any other pop act managing to make this much of an impact so quickly and \n\n \"Wannabe\" is the debut single by English girl group the Spice Girls.

These keys are easily interchanged using enharmonic equivalents. Enharmonic means that the notes sound the same, but are written differently. For example, the key signature of D major, with five flats, contains the same sounding notes, enharmonically, as C major (seven sharps). After C comes the key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A). The \"eighth sharp\" is placed on the F, to make it F. The key of D, with nine sharps, has another sharp placed on the C, making it C. The \n\nD E  F  G , A B C  D. Modern notation for enharmonic notes requires two special symbols for raised and lowered quarter tones or half-semitones or quarter steps. Some symbols used for a quarter-tone flat are a downward-pointing arrow ↓, or a flat combined with an upward-pointing arrow ↑. Similarly, for a quarter-tone sharp, an upward-pointing arrow may be used, or else a sharp with a downward-pointing arrow. Three-quarter flat and sharp symbols are formed similarly. A further modern notation involves reversed flat signs for quarter-flat, so that an enharmonic tetrachord may be represented: or The double-flat symbol is used for modern notation of the third tone in the tetrachord to keep scale notes in letter sequence, and to remind the reader that the third tone in an enharmonic tetrachord (say F, shown above) was not tuned quite the same as the second note in a diatonic or chromatic scale (the E expected instead of F).\n\n is true for key signatures with flats; The key of E (four sharps) is equivalent to the key of F (again, one fifth below the key of C, following the pattern of flat key signatures). The last flat is placed on the B, making it B. Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called theoretical keys: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted). There does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures: \n\n temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. The top of the circle shows the key of C Major, with no sharps or flats. Proceeding clockwise, the pitches ascend by fifths. The key signatures associated with those pitches also change: the key of G has one sharp, the key of D has 2 sharps, and so on. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the top of the circle, the notes change by descending fifths and the key signatures change accordingly: the key of F has one flat, the key of B has 2 flats, and so \n\n In music, flat (Italian bemolle for \"soft B\") means \"lower in pitch\". Flat is the opposite of sharp, which is a raising of pitch. In musical notation, flat means \"lower in pitch by one semitone (half step)\", notated using the symbol which is derived from a stylised lowercase 'b'. For instance, the music below has a key signature with three flats (indicating either E major or C minor) and the note, D, has a flat accidental.  Under twelve-tone equal temperament, D for instance is enharmonically equivalent to C, and G is equivalent to F. In any other tuning system, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. In intonation, flat can also mean \"slightly lower in pitch\" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is \"flat\" with respect to the other. Furthermore, the verb flatten means to lower the pitch of a note, typically by a small musical interval.\n\nQuestion: What are the only two musical notes which have no flats?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Especially in the southwestern part of the country, the predominant variety of noodles are Spätzle, made with a large number of eggs, and Maultaschen, traditional stuffed noodles reminiscent of ravioli. Besides noodles, potatoes are common. Potatoes entered the German cuisine in the late 17th century, and were almost ubiquitous in the 19th century and since. They most often are boiled (in salt water, Salzkartoffeln), but mashed (Kartoffelpüree or Kartoffelbrei) and pan-roasted potatoes (Bratkartoffeln) also are traditional. French fries, called Pommes frites, Pommes (spoken as \"Pom fritz\" or, respectively, \"Pommes\", deviating from the French pronunciation which would be \"Pom freet\" or \"Pom\") or regionally as Fritten in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either ketchup or mayonnaise, or, as Pommes rot/weiß (lit. fries red/white), with both. Also common are dumplings (including Klöße as the term in the north or Knödel as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including Schupfnudeln, which are similar to Italian gnocchi. Salads, also modern variations, as well as vegetarian dishes are becoming more and more popular in Germany.\n\n In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (Paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch (from \"Hungarian\")) and salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). Potato chips made from ground potatoes are called Stapelchips rather than Kartoffelchips for legal reasons, according to the definitions in the Lebensmittelbuch (Codex Alimentarius). In Ireland, the two most popular flavors are cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar. \n\n Julien. The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). (Roughly 0.4, 0.3 and 0.15 inch respectively.) Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words). Often served with ketchup or \n\n fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. Street foods in Victorian London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns, and jellied eels. Mumbai, India has more than a half a million of street food vendors.  Street food culture in China was first developed in the Tang Dynasty and continued to evolve over millennia. Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary tourism. Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced \n\n French fries (North American English), chips (British English), finger chips (Indian English), French-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually in a deep fryer. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. Chips can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, oven chips, uses less or no oil.\n\nQuestion: From which country do French fries originate?

Due to this, she received the last rites of the Church. She recovered, but the illness left her weak. The strength which had formerly sustained her in her work in the fields was no more. Mary was now thin and frail; a shell of her formerly robust self. She took an apprenticeship as a seamstress in the town and worked diligently at the craft. Like John Bosco, the skills which she learned in her youth, she was able to pass on to those who would come after her. After she recovered from her illness, in the month of October, Mary was walking in her village and was suddenly astounded to see before her a large building with a courtyard and many \n\nWithin two weeks she noticed a distinct improvement in her moods and general outlook on life.We talked about seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a depressive illness caused by a lack of exposure to natural light, and Mary decided to purchase a full-spectrum light; her health insurance company eventually reimbursed her.Mary was thin, almost emaciated looking, with a pale complexion, dark circles under her eyes, and a distinct moaning quality to her voice (all Water qualities). Her physical symptoms were also Water-related; in addition to lupus and chronic urinary tract infections, she had a history of lower back pain and stiffness, especially in the mornings and after exertion, and extreme fatigue in the late afternoon (Water's hours). I also noted an affinity to Fire in her history of panic attacks and heart palpitations, her tendency to become agitated and anxious when she was stressed, and her exceptionally serious demeanor (indicating a deficiency in Fire). When I tried to get her to laugh by telling a joke, she became very cross with me. \"This is serious,\" she said, tears in her eyes. \"Please—can't you help me?\" RESTORING HARMONY\n\n **Lifestyle:** A deeply spiritual person—before she became a social worker, she had considered joining a religious order—Mary often had trouble separating her own problems from other people's miseries. \"The Chinese would say that the gates to your heart are stuck open,\" I said, \"and you are being consumed by emotions. You need to bring more Fire into your Water, which is simply another means of saying that you need more joy and light in your life.\" Bringing more light into her life was important both literally and figuratively. As Mary talked about her problems, she expressed a long-standing hatred for winter, explaining that her lupus symptoms often intensified during the winter months, when she suffered from mood swings and periodic bouts of depression as well.

Mary felt she was out of control. While giving evidence to the examiner for the Central Board of His Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the Employment of Children in Factories, the overseer said: \"Her mother has told me to take her to myself, and have her earnings, and keep her on bread and water, and put a lock of straw in one corner of the room for her to lie on.\" Her mother, on cross examination said: \"I told him to take her, and he might have her earnings, and let her lie in one corner of his room all night, to frighten her. I never said a lock of straw.\"\n\n On a dark and rainy night, a woman (Lotta Losten) comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, which causes a long-haired, humanlike silhouette to become visible at the other end of the hallway. Surprised, the woman turns the light back on and the silhouette vanishes. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it is inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning.

The hallway light clicks back on and she sees it is on again and the door is only slightly ajar again. She is relieved, but unfortunately suddenly sees a monstrous humanoid with all-white eyes and an open mouth at her bedside table.

Some writing systems have two major types of allographs for each letter: an uppercase form (also called capital or majuscule) and a lowercase form (also called minuscule). Upper- and lowercase letters represent the same sound, but serve different functions in writing. Capital letters are most often used at the beginning of a sentence, as the first letter of a proper name or title, or in headers or inscriptions. They may also serve other functions, such as in the German language where all nouns begin with capital letters. In practical terms, tests have proven that lowercase words are easier to read. They also take up less space on the page, a considerable benefit when materials such as paper and ink were scarce and valuable. The terms uppercase and lowercase originated in the days of handset type for printing presses. Individual letter blocks were kept in specific compartments of drawers in a type case. Capital letters were stored in a higher drawer or upper case.\n\n The first word processing device (a \"Machine for Transcribing Letters\" that appears to have been similar to a typewriter) was patented by Henry Mill for a machine that was capable of \"writing so clearly and accurately you could not distinguish it from a printing press\". More than a century later, another patent appeared in the name of William Austin Burt for the typographer. In the late 19th century, Christopher Latham Sholes created the first recognizable typewriter although it was a large size, which was described as a \"literary piano\". The only \"word processing\" these mechanical systems could perform was to change where letters appeared on the page, to fill in spaces that were previously left on the page, or to skip over lines. It was not until decades later that the introduction of electricity and electronics into \n\n shorthand systems. In contrast, Personal Shorthand uses only the 26 letters of the alphabet, without any special symbols, positioning, or punctuation, and it can therefore be written cursively, printed, typed, or even entered in a computer without special typefaces or graphics. Given years of practice, symbol shorthand writers could sometimes acquire skills of 150 or even 200 words per minute, which might have qualified them for demanding positions such as court reporting, typically dominated today by machine shorthands. Due to the extensive time necessary, few achieved such a level. Most symbol shorthand writers in secretarial positions wrote between 80 and 140 \n\n The English word antidisestablishmentarianism (, also, US also ) is notable for its unusual length of 28 letters and 12 syllables, and is one of the longest words in the English language. It has been cited as the longest word in the English language (excluding coined and technical terms), although some dictionaries do not recognize it because of its low usage in everyday lexicon. The longest word found in a major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, but this is a technical term that was coined specifically to be the longest word. The word became known in the public realm in the United States via a popular television show in the 1950s, The $64,000 Question, when a young contestant correctly spelled it to win. A slightly longer but less commonly accepted variant can be found in the Duke Ellington song \"You're Just an Old Antidisestablishmentarianismist\".\n\nThe longest words typable with only the left hand using conventional hand placement on a QWERTY keyboard are tesseradecades, aftercataracts, and the more common but sometimes hyphenated sweaterdresses. Using the right hand alone, the longest word that can be typed is johnny-jump-up, or, excluding hyphens, monimolimnion and phyllophyllin. ; The longest English word typable using only the top row of letters has 11 letters: rupturewort. The word teetertotter (used in North American English) is longer at 12 letters, although it is usually spelled with a hyphen. ; The longest using only the middle row is shakalshas (10 letters). Nine-letter words include flagfalls; eight-letter words include galahads and alfalfas. ; Since the bottom row contains no vowels, no standard words can be formed. ; The longest words typable by alternating left and right hands are antiskepticism and leucocytozoans respectively. ; On a Dvorak keyboard, the longest \"left-handed\" words are epopoeia, jipijapa, peekapoo, and quiaquia. Other such long words are papaya, Kikuyu, opaque, and upkeep. Kikuyu is typed entirely with the index finger, and so the longest one-fingered word on the Dvorak keyboard. There are no vowels on the right-hand side, and so the longest \"right-handed\" word is crwth. \n\nQuestion: What is the longest word can be typed using only the top row of letters on a typewriter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Similar evacuations were carried out on the floors occupied by Fiduciary Trust, on the 90th, 94th–97th floors, as well as in the offices of Fuji Bank (on floors 79–82), CSC (floor 87) and Euro Brokers on floor 84, which occupied the floors directly above the 78th floor Skylobby. Executives such as Eisenberg instructed their employees to take the stairs down to the 78th floor Skylobby, where they could take an express elevator to the ground level and exit the building. Many were aided \n\n Though the building is physically 68 stories tall,  the top floor is numbered 78. According to one of Macklowe's lawyers, this is because the base of the building has high ceilings. Macklowe said Donald Trump had inspired him to label the top floor with a higher number than the physical number of stories the building had. Floor number 13 is skipped, and floor 17 (containing mechanical equipment) is not labeled on the building's condominium offering plan. Floor numbers 18 through 29 are skipped completely. The first residential story, floor 30, would have been labeled as floor 18 under traditional counting methods and if the mechanical story was counted as one floor. The building has 653000 ft2 of office, retail, and residential space in total.\n\n traffic necessitates a second lift the alternate floors strategy is sometimes still applied, not only for the doorway reduction but also, provisionally upon the passengers preferring no particular floor beyond capacity, it tends toward halving the total delay imposed by the stops en-route. Sometimes, two elevators are divided so that all floors are served, but one elevator only serves odd floors and the other even, which would often be less efficient for passengers, but cheaper to install because the group control of elevators was more complex than single control.

An arrangement often found in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half the total number of floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; for example a lift of a 24-storey building would only stop at 12 levels, with staircases used to access the \"upper\" or \"lower\" level from each intermediate landing.

He climbs up a flight of stairs to the top floor, opens the unlocked door to the apartment, and is shocked to see his father making love to his fiancée. Dazed and utterly confused, he tumbles backwards, hits the low banister and falls down the stairwell. The MP runs down the stairs completely naked, finding Martyn dead, sprawled out on the ground floor. He kneels on the floor and clutches Martyn's body to him until the police arrive.

However, it may have been as early as 1906 when an amateur club with the same name was formed. There were players called Storrs and Manwood who played in the 1906 and 1909 teams, and a player called Rhodes who played in the amateur's first game; a Herbert Rhodes was a significant benefactor of the 'later' Celtic.

In 1906 they won the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup for the first time, but two years later the young Owls gained their revenge by pipping Denaby to the Midland League title. They won the Senior Cup for a second time in 1910 but resigned from the Midland League in 1913 to rejoin the Association League after falling on hard times and finishing bottom of the league for two years running. This came just a year after they had moved to their new home \n\n luck again in the local football scene, quickly rising to become one of the strongest clubs in the Craigavon area. Irish Football League membership remained elusive during these years, partly due to the presence of Glenavon down the road at a time when the IFA was trying to reach out to new footballing towns.

The club was a foundation team of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and in 1897 became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which was renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.

Scotland won 26 of the 51 British Home Championships held before the Second World War, sharing nine of those titles. The 7–2 defeat by the Scots in 1878 stood England's record loss until 1954. Another particularly notable Scotland win against England was a 5–1 win at Wembley against England in 1928, which led to that team being dubbed the Wembley Wizards. However, the Scottish eleven in that match never played together again, and soon a dispute with the English authorities over the release of players in 1930 led to the SFA only selecting home-based players for some time.

Established in 1927, Midway served as Chicago's primary airport until the opening of O'Hare International Airport in 1955. Today, Midway is one of the busiest airports in the nation, the second-busiest airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and the state of Illinois, and serving 20,844,860 passengers in 2019. Midway is a base for Southwest Airlines, which carries over 95% of the passengers at the airport.

Various instrument approaches to all runways are available, including an on-site VORTAC and instrument landing system (ILS). The complex is served by a 24-hour fixed-base operator, Signature Flight Services. Starting in late 2018, the Mobile Airport Authority began renovating an underutilized building partially occupied by Airbus into a low cost carrier passenger airport facility called Terminal 1. After its opening on May 1, 2019, Terminal 1 houses two boarding gates and five ticket counters. Frontier Airlines Flight 410 from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was the first scheduled revenue flight, arriving at the facility on May 1. In the summer of 2019, the authority plans to take over the remaining space in the building to completely build out Terminal 1. After this build-out, Terminal 1 will have four gates and additional holding and concession space. The total square footage will be around 50,000 square feet. Terminal 1 is located at the southern terminus of Michigan Avenue in the Brookley complex, less than a mile south of Interstate 10.\n\nChicago O'Hare International Airport (partial) ; Patten Industries Heliport \n\n Chicago is served by O'Hare International Airport, the world's busiest airport measured by airline operations, on the far Northwest Side, and Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second-busiest by total passenger traffic. Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. Gary/Chicago International Airport and Chicago Rockford International Airport, located in Gary, Indiana and Rockford, Illinois, respectively, can serve as alternative Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway.

The first provinces were named mueang (เมือง, township) as those developed from the historical city-states. There were both mueang directly dependent from Bangkok (thus similar to the modern province), as well as mueang under the supervision of a more powerful neighbouring mueang, or part of the semi-independent tributary states. In 1906 the transition to the term changwat started, which was finalised in 1916. After the abolition of the monthon, a new subdivision named \"region\" (ภาค, Phak) was established. At first there were four regions with changing \n\n with it being 9.9% Malay in that year&ndash;an absolutely gigantic increase from 1990, when it was only 2.8% Malay. Both Sisaket and Surin had Khmer-speaking percentages of over 25.0% in both 1990 and 2000, with Surin even having a Khmer-speaking majority of over 60.0% in 1990, albeit with it falling just short of a Khmer-speaking majority in 2000. Meanwhile, Buriram had almost no Khmer speakers in 1990 but saw its Khmer percentage explode and increase to over 25.0% of its total population by 2000. Some Thai provinces also had Vietnamese-speaking, Laotian-speaking, Burmese-speaking, Peguan-speaking, Chinese-speaking, and/or Japanese-speaking minorities in 1990 and/or 2000, but these minorities were always a single-digit \n\n Nearby Southeast Asian countries have similar styles of boxing martial arts. At an ASEAN meeting in 1995, Cambodia suggested that the boxing style made popular from Thailand, Muay Thai, be referred to as \"Sovannaphum boxing\" or \"SEA Boxing\", which represented Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Sovannaphum means \"golden land\" in Khmer and is written as Suwannabhumi in Thai. The name refers to mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian language of Pali. The aim was to unite the styles of Southeast Asian boxing under a universal term and to avoid a politically incorrect misnomer. Thailand would not compromise, stating that each Southeast Asian country has its own boxing style and that Thailand was responsible for making its boxing style an international sport. When the sport debuted at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, Cambodia did not enter the Muay Thai event in protest of the name used to refer to the sport. At recent Southeast Asian Games, Southeast Asian boxing has been known by the ethnic neutral term of \"Muay\".\n\n Relations between Portugal and Thailand date as far as the 16th century. Portugal was the first European nation to make contact with the Ayutthaya Kingdom, in 1511. The Portuguese became dominant foreign traders, and established a presence in the capital. Portuguese traders introduced firearms as well as New-World goods from the Columbian Exchange, influencing Thai cuisine, language and culture. Although Portugal's overseas influence gradually declined from the 17th century, it maintained ties with Siam. The Portuguese Embassy in Bangkok, established in 1820, is the oldest diplomatic mission in the country. In contrast to other European powers, against whose colonial aspirations Siam struggled during the 19th century, Siam's relationship with Portugal was largely friendly. Both countries elevated their missions to embassy status in 1964, and Thailand established a resident embassy in Lisbon in 1981. Today, the two countries share a small amount of trade, tourism and cultural activities.\n\n The Malaysian Siamese or Thai Malaysians are an ethnicity or community principally exists in Northern Peninsular Malaysia which is a relatively homogeneous cultural region to Southern Burma and Southern Thailand but was separated by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Siam.

In 2014, there were nearly 70,000 people self-identifying as \"Siamese\" or \"Thai\" who held Malaysian nationality.

Belgium was one of the countries hit hardest by the war; almost the whole of the country was occupied by Germany, and over 43,000 Belgians, including 30,000 civilians, had died as a result. Belgium sought compensation, and had its eye on any and all of its neighbours; in November 1918, Lord Hardinge, the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, told the Dutch ambassador in London, \"The Belgians are on the make, and they want to grab whatever they can.\" From early 1919, Belgium engaged in a propaganda campaign to promote its vision of annexation. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Belgian delegation argued in favour of the international community allowing Belgium to annex Luxembourg. However, fearing loss of influence over the left bank of the Rhine, France \n\n Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to annex Luxembourg into its empire. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality. In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the thrones of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden deterioration in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary was supported by the German Empire, while Serbia had the backing of the \n\n  The Greater Region of Luxembourg is characterized by a very high number of daily commuters: in 2007&ndash;08 there were 164,000 altogether, of whom 132,000 worked in Luxembourg. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the European Development Pole in the cross-border area of Longwy in France, Rodange in Luxembourg and Athus in Belgium. The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. More than half of them come from Lorraine and almost three-quarters (73.4%) work in Luxembourg. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing. The other subregions have more out-commuters than in-commuters. Lorraine provides the highest number of workers for the neighbouring regions (89,478 as of 2009).\n\n The most important developments for the people of SaarLorLux have been the launch of the Euro and the signing of the Schengen Agreement. The launch of the Euro gave the citizens of the border region the possibility to trade across the border without the need for advanced arithmetic operations to calculate the price, when one German mark was about three French francs and about twenty Luxembourgian francs or Belgian francs. The Euro negates the need for SaarLorLux to have currency of its own. The Schengen agreement brought the removal of border posts and border checks. Today, for citizens of the European Union the neighbouring village across the border can be reached the same way as a village in one's own country. Although this agreement was signed on a river boat on the river Moselle near Schengen, at the border triangle of Lorraine, Luxembourg and Saarland, it was not created especially for the use of the region, but the whole of the founding members: the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic, and now 28 European States.\n\n Bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany, Luxembourg has a population of over half a million people in an area of 2,586 km2. A representative democracy and constitutional monarchy ruled by a Grand Duke, it is the world's only remaining Grand Duchy. The country has a highly developed economy, with the world's highest GDP per capita. Its strategic importance dates back to a Roman era fortress and Frankish count's castle site in the Early Middle Ages. The City of Luxembourg, the capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the European Union and an important financial centre.

The series is based on the Scrooge McDuck character and the Uncle Scrooge comic books created by Carl Barks. The series stars Scrooge, his great-nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie and Webby Vanderquack, and several characters created for the series. While Huey, Dewey, and Louie originated in Donald Duck animated short subjects in the 1930s, their characterization on DuckTales approximated that of Barks' comics. Although Donald Duck was a major player in the Uncle Scrooge comics, he appeared as a guest star in a few DuckTales episodes. The series aired in syndication. It premiered during the week of September 14–18, 1987 with an edited two-hour television movie version of the five-part serial \"Treasure of the Golden Suns\". (The airdate varied by market – WSYT aired it on September 18, while WSBK-TV aired it on September 20). Subsequently, \n\n Della Duck (voiced by Paget Brewster ) is the mother of Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck, the twin sister of their uncle Donald Duck, and the niece of Scrooge McDuck. While the character had previously appeared in Disney comics, the 2017 Ducktales series marks her first on-screen appearance in any official animated media. Before the events of the series, she used to go adventuring with her brother and uncle, and just like how Donald mostly wears a sailor shirt, Della typically sports a pilot's outfit. Her sons grew up without knowing their mother and the first season sees the ducklings – initially Dewey and Webby - \n\n the one most eager to find out what happened to their mother Della; and Louie, wearing a green hoodie, is the youngest, laid-back and money-obsessed brother, and a skilled entrepreneur, jokingly described as the \"evil triplet\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the boys are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during \"Woo-oo!\", but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure, and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat, Donald and the boys move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.\n\n Donald Duck (voiced by Tony Anselmo) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"The Wise Little Hen\", the nephew of Scrooge McDuck, the older twin brother of Della Duck, and the uncle of her sons Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck. In the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys. After leaving his nephews with Scrooge in order to serve with the US Navy, he makes occasional appearances while crossing paths with the rest of the Ducks during their adventures. In the first-season finale, he returns to Duckburg \n\n Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck (all voiced by Russi Taylor in the 1987 series, DuckTales the Movie, and DuckTales: Remastered; Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck, the sons of his sister Della Duck, friends of Webby, and the grand-nephews of their uncle Scrooge McDuck. They were originally created for the comics by Ted Osborne and Al Taliaferro in 1937. In the 1987 series, the boys are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy. All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the Junior Woodchucks scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits – a cap and jumper – with the \n\nQuestion: What are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was composed by Holly Knight and Heart band member Nancy Wilson. \"There's The Girl\" was released in a remixed version as the third single from Heart's ninth studio album, Bad Animals. Knight is known as a very successful songwriter who was responsible for penning many hit singles during the 1980s. Like Heart's 1986 #1 single \"These Dreams\", the lead vocals on \"There's the Girl\" were performed by Nancy Wilson, rather than Ann Wilson, the usual lead singer for the group (though most fans did not realize this until the video was released or they saw the song performed live). The single climbed to #12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and was also a Top-40 single on the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #34. The song made appearances in late 1987 episodes of the daytime soap operas All My Children and The Young and the Restless.\n\n The song charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts in 1997, peaking at number 50 on the former and number 3 on the latter. Although it first appeared on the Hot Country Songs charts at that time, it was not officially released as a single to the country format until a year later. The song was the follow-up to her single \"A Broken Wing,\" to which \"Valentine\" originally served as the b-side. Upon its official release, \"Valentine\" peaked at number 9.\n\n When Valentine was 9 years old, he and his brother formed the band The Newtrons. Early on he founded the CityBoyZ Muzik label and signed hip-hop artist Bailey, and subsequently released the song “Go Dumb” which was originally a record from his Hide Ya Breezy mixtape. Valentine’s 2011 album The Testimony featured artists Keri Hilson, Tank, Twista, Gucci Mane and LeToya Luckett. The album accumulated over 17 thousand records sold and reached the iTunes top 10 for R&B/Soul. Valentine recorded “My Girl” with Chris Brown for In My Zone 2. Valentine’s production company, Song Dynasty, includes his brother Bobby Newt, his friend Texx and the singer Tank. The team has written and produced songs for artists such as Jamie Foxx, Keyshia Cole and Ron Isley. They recently produced Now or Never, Tank's first Atlantic Records project. The album’s second single, “Emergency,” held the number 5 spot on the Billboard music charts. They wrote the song “Regret” for R&B singer LeToya Luckett featuring Ludacris, which also peaked at #78 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and #8 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\n \"Valentine\" is a song co-written and performed by American recording artist Jim Brickman, with a guest vocal from Martina McBride. It first appeared on his 1997 album Picture This, and later on McBride's album Evolution.\n\n \"Valentine\" is a song by British band T'Pau, which was released in 1988 as the fifth single from their debut studio album Bridge of Spies. It was written by Ronnie Rogers and Carol Decker, and produced by Roy Thomas Baker. It reached No. 9 in the UK and remained on the charts for eight weeks. A promotional video was filmed to promote the single, directed by Brian Grant. The single's B-side, \"Giving My Love Away\", was exclusive to the single. For the 12\" vinyl and CD versions of the single, a bonus cover version of \"I'm a Believer\" was included, which featured Rogers on lead vocal. Speaking to Songfacts in 2015, Decker revealed of the song: \"I wrote it about an ex of mine. We would bump into each other after we split and he'd moved on and had a nice girlfriend. We'd smile and say \"Hi,\" but I was still crazy about him so I always had to hide how I felt, and be cool and casual.\" In 1993, the song re-entered the charts and reached No. 53 when it was re-issued to promote the compilation Heart and Soul – The Very Best of T'Pau.\n\nQuestion: Who had a top ten hit in 1988 with Valentine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Examples of more frequent characters in English are the vowels, m, r, s, t...etc. In other languages such as Chinese, characters are morphemes that are individual words. More than 100,000 words in Chinese are made of the same 5,000 characters. As people process the first character of the word, they make a mental prediction of what the word is before reading the rest of the characters. If the character and other preprocessing information indicates that the word is short and familiar, the reader is more likely to skip the entire word. The character frequency may be more important when reading than the frequency of the word as a whole. In a study \n\n The following list, of about 350 words, is based on documented lists of the top 100, 200, or 400 most commonly misspelled words in all variants of the English language, rather than listing every conceivable misspelled word. Each word is followed by examples of misspellings:\n\n Commonly misspelled English words (UK: misspelt words) are words that are often unintentionally misspelled in general writing. A selected list of common words is presented below, under Documented list of common misspellings. Although the word common is subjective depending on the situation, the focus is on general writing, rather than in a specific field. Accepted spellings also vary by country or region, with some rejecting the American or British variants as incorrect for the region. Within a particular field of study, such as computer graphics, other words might be more common for misspelling, such as \"pixel\" misspelled as \"pixle\" (or variants \"cesium\" and \"caesium\"). Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in slang, abbreviations, or in song lyrics, etc. In general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling \"\" for \"consensus\" found in numerous webpages. Other common misspellings include \"\" (for \"equipment\"), \"\" (for \"independent\"), \"readible\" (for readable), or \"usible\" (for usable or useable).\n\n caused by just 20% of the bugs. 20% of the world creates roughly 80% of worldwide GDP. 80% of healthcare expenses in the US are caused by 20% of the population. Zipf's law, described as an \"empirical statistical law\" of linguistics, is another example. According to the \"law\", given some dataset of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency rank.

In the game, the player controls Pac-Man as he must eat all of the dots while avoiding the colored ghosts that chase him in the maze. Eating large flashing \"Power Pellets\" will allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points, which lasts for a short period of time. A new feature to this game allows Pac-Man to jump over the ghosts to evade capture. It is the ninth title in the Pac-Man video game series and was the last one developed for arcades up until the release of Pac-Man \n\n Pac-Man (パックマン) is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the video game franchise of the same name. Created by Toru Iwatani, he first appeared in the arcade game Pac-Man (1980), and has since appeared in more than 30 licensed sequels and spin-offs for multiple platforms, and spawning mass amounts of merchandise in his image, including two television series and a hit single by Buckner & Garcia. He is the official mascot of Bandai Namco Entertainment. Pac-Man's most common antagonists are the Ghost Gang — Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde that are determined to defeat him to accomplish their goals, which change throughout the series. Pac-Man also has a voracious appetite, being able to consume vast amounts of food in a short timespan, and can eat his enemies by consuming large \"Power Pellets\". He \n\n  The core gameplay of Jr. Pac-Man is similar to its predecessors. The player controls the eponymous Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie), and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze, while four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Tim) chase him around the maze and attempt to catch him. Eating an power pellet turns the ghosts blue, briefly allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze is presented and the gameplay continues. The mazes are now two times the width of the monitor and scroll horizontally. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and five of them have six power pellets instead of four, but none of them have tunnels that wrap around from one side \n\n Pac-Mania is an isometric maze game. The player controls Pac-Man, a yellow circular creature that must eat all of the pellets in each stage while avoiding the five colored ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde and Sue.

Clearing the stage of pellets will allow Pac-Man to move to the next. New to this game is the ability to jump over the ghosts, allowing Pac-Man to evade capture.

This game features a name error in which Blinky and Clyde's names are swapped. Alongside retaining identical gameplay from the original game, a few new gimmicks have been added as well. The game features 23 rounds in total split into 6 worlds, each with their own unique maze similar to Ms. Pac-Man, with the last round taking the form of a boss fight.

It bears large medial and lateral condyles, which are important for articulation and stability at the knee joint. These condyles serve as points of attachment for ligaments and tendons, providing support and facilitating movement of the lower limb.\n\nAdditionally, the distal end of the femur has a large head on a slightly angled neck. This head forms part of the hip joint, connecting with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. The angled neck of the femur allows for efficient weight-bearing and distribution of forces during movements such as walking or running.\n\nAnother significant feature of the distal femur is the presence of a large trochanter. The trochanter serves as an attachment point for various muscles of the hip, including the gluteal muscles. These muscles are essential for stabilizing the hip joint and facilitating movements such as hip extension and rotation.\n\nOverall, the features of the distal end of the femur contribute to its role in supporting body weight, enabling movement, and maintaining stability at the knee and hip joints.\n\nThe hip’s unique anatomy enables it to be both extremely strong and amazingly flexible, so it can bear weight and allow for a wide range of movement.\nRotation - pointing toes inward (internal rotation) or outward (external rotation) and then moving the straightened leg in the direction of the toes.\nThe hip is located where the top of the femur bone, or thighbone, fits into the pelvis.\nThe femur bone is the longest bone in the body, extending from the knee to the hip. At the top of the femur bone is the greater trochanter, that boney knob that people often refer to as their hip, and the bulbous \"femoral head\" which makes contact with the pelvis and forms the ball of the ball and socket joint. It is covered with articular cartilage, which serves to decrease friction.\nThe femoral head fits into the acetabulum, the round socket of the pelvic bone.\nBoth the femoral head and the acetabulum are lined with articular cartilage.\nArticular cartilage is an extremely slippery, strong, flexible material that covers a bone at the site of the joint.\nWhen the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum, the articular cartilage allows the two surfaces to glide against each other.\nArticular cartilage also acts as a shock absorber, cushioning bones against impacting each other (e.g. while jumping).\nWhen articular cartilage is damaged or thinned, its ability to protect against friction and impact are impeded.\nRead more about What Is Cartilage?\nA strong piece of cartilage, called the labrum, rings the outer edge of the acetabulum. The labrum deepens the socket joint, making the joint more stable, but its elasticity allows for flexibility.\nOver time the smooth articular cartilage that makes up the surfaces of the hip joint may be damaged or blemished by normal wear and tear or from trauma. This process is referred to as arthritis.\nThe hip has several ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvis and tendons connecting the bones to many surrounding muscles. Tightness of these ligaments and tendons can cause hip instability and pain.\nStrong and flexible ligaments and tendons provide structure to the hip, reducing strain on the joint, so most hip osteoarthritis therapies will including stretching and strengthening of these structures.\nA synovial membrane encapsulates the entire hip joint. This membrane produces synovial fluid, a viscous substance that lubricates and circulates nutrients to the joint.\nWhen the hip is at rest, the synovial fluid is stored in the cartilage, much like water in a sponge.\nWhen the hip rotates or bears weight the synovial fluid is squeezed out. Therefore, joint use is necessary to keep the hip joint lubricated and healthy.\nSmall sacs of synovial fluid, called bursae (singular is \"bursa\") surround all major joints, including the hip joint. Bursae help protect the muscles, bones and tendons from friction as the hip moves. When the bursae are inflamed, the condition is called hip bursitis.\nHamstrings, a group of muscles that comprise the back of the thigh and extend to just below the knee.\nTogether, these muscles support the hip joint, so exercises to relieve hip osteoarthritis symptoms will focus on these muscles as well as muscles of the core.\nWhen the hip joint becomes inflamed and painful, the pain may be felt in the groin but may also be referred into the back, buttocks and down the front or back of the leg.\nIt is important to note that the degree of anatomical problems (such as the degree of hip joint deterioration) that can be seen on a hip x-ray does not always correlate with the level of pain.\nFor example, a patient could have hip x-rays that show moderate right hip arthritis and mild arthritis on the left, but he or she may only have pain on the side showing mild hip arthritis.\nThis counterintuitive result is due to the fact that the pain felt from arthritis is usually due to inflammation in the joint and not the arthritis itself. This concept applies to all the joints in the body and is important to understand because treating the inflammation will often treat the pain and dysfunction and can often help someone put off surgery or avoid it all together.\n\n A long bone is one that is cylindrical in shape, being longer than it is wide. However, the term describes the shape of a bone, not its size, which is relative. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), as well as in the fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move when muscles contract. They are responsible for the body's height.\n\n In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.\n\n The femur is the only bone in the thigh and serves as an attachment site for all muscles in the thigh. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. By most measures, the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body. The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphysis or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Studies have shown that most people, regardless of handedness, use their dominant hand for tasks that require accuracy. This means that anaesthetists, who often need to perform precise actions during procedures, should prioritize using their dominant hand.\n\nMedical equipment is typically designed for right-handed individuals, which can pose challenges for left-handed anaesthetists. In a study conducted in Korea, it was found that only 6% of participants were left-handed and 8% were ambidextrous. The majority of participants were right-handed or ambidextrous individuals who used their right hand for tasks requiring accuracy.\n\nTo address this issue, workplace adjustments should be made to accommodate anaesthetists' dominant hands. Ideally, equipment should be designed in a way that is neutral and effective for both left-handed and right-handed individuals. For example, placing the reservoir bag and common gas outlets at the center of the machine can allow easier access for both groups.\n\nBy optimizing workplace adjustments to suit anaesthetists' dominant hands, it can help enhance their overall performance and potentially improve patient outcomes during procedures.\n\nReference:\n- Hand dominance and hand use behavior reported in a survey of 2437... (Jung)\n- Hand dominance and implications for left-handed operation of controls (Garonzik)\n\nThe human hands serve several important functions. They are the primary organs for physically manipulating the environment, allowing us to perform a wide range of tasks with varying levels of precision. From wielding a club to threading a needle, our hands enable us to engage in both rough motor skills and fine motor skills.\n\nOne crucial function of the hands is their ability to provide tactile feedback. The fingertips contain a high concentration of nerve endings, making them incredibly sensitive to touch. This allows us to explore and interact with objects in our surroundings, enhancing our sense of touch.\n\nIn terms of handedness, each hand is predominantly controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain. This means that individuals have a preferred hand choice for single-handed activities like writing or using utensils. Handedness is determined by genetic factors and reflects an individual trait.\n\nIt's important to note that while handedness is common, it is not universal. Some individuals may be ambidextrous, meaning they can use both hands equally well for various tasks. The exact mechanisms behind handedness determination are still not fully understood and continue to be an area of research in neuroscience.\n\nOverall, the human hands play a vital role in our daily lives by enabling us to interact with our environment and experience the world through touch.\n\n Organizational ambidexterity refers to an organization's ability to be efficient in its management of today's business and also adaptable for coping with tomorrow's changing demand. Just as being ambidextrous means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both exploration and exploitation techniques to be successful.\n\nAmbidextrous techniques in cardiac surgery.\nAmbidexterity is the state of being equally adept in the use of both the left and right hands. It is advantageous in surgeons, but the degree of ambidexterity found among them varies greatly. It is a very desirable attribute in laparoscopic surgery. It provides the surgeon with additional options for performing critical surgical steps when positioning and space are constrained, as is often the case in cardiac surgery and even more so in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Mentoring for ambidexterity training can be initiated as early as during medical school.  In this tutorial we demonstrate ambidextrous surgical techniques such as the 'all in one hand' technique of using two forceps in one hand, Gilbert's technique of left internal mammary harvest, and a proximal anastomosis technique in aortocoronary bypass.\n\nQuestion: What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As Maid Marian has died and Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) is perpetually away battling in the Crusades, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her.

Footage of him would later be posthumously used in 2006's Superman Returns.\n\n purposes if juvenile, lesser-known, or first-time performers appear in a larger role: e.g., Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were both credited before the title in Superman (1978), while Christopher Reeve, the then-unknown actor who played the title character and protagonist, was not, even though Brando only appears in the introduction while Hackman was the main antagonist. Similarly in Apocalypse Now, Brando was billed first though he only appears at the end as the film's chief antagonist, while Robert Duvall was billed second despite a brief supporting role that earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, and Martin Sheen who portrayed the main character was billed third. It \n\n was blended, balanced and added back in. Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and mad scientist Dr. Totenkopf. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival BBC footage of the actor and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar technique was used two years later in Superman Returns (2006) with Marlon Brando. Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from mid-2004, one week before Spider-Man 2, to September. He courted the Internet press and finally made an appearance at the San Diego Comic-Con with key cast members in an attempt to generate some advance buzz.\n\n Kirk Alyn played Superman in two low-budget 1940s serials, but failed to find work afterward because he was too closely identified with the role. As a result, he was relegated to voiceovers, commercials, and uncredited screen roles. He later appeared as Lois Lane's father in the 1978 Superman film. Alyn had Alzheimer's disease later in his life and died in 1999 at the age of 88.\n\n to be common practice to give top billing based on a person's level of fame, regardless of the significance of their role in the film.

Made on a budget of $500, the film was shown at a local cinema and generated a profit of $1. \"I counted the receipts that night\", Spielberg has recalled, \"And we charged a dollar a ticket. Five hundred people came to the movie and I think somebody probably paid two dollars, because we made one dollar profit that night, and that was it.\" Although Firelight is Spielberg's first film made, it is not seen as his directorial debut. The film widely seen as his feature-length directorial debut is Duel (1971), although \"L.A. 2017\", his long-form episode of The Name of the Game, precedes it. Only three minutes and forty seconds of footage has been made public, about 3% of the original length. Spielberg returned to its subject matter for his third major film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).\n\n I had directed Schindler I wouldn't be able to do Jurassic Park.\" The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable. Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"blood money\", and believed the film would flop. The film was a box office success, bringing in over $320 million and is considered a historic motion picture that poignantly captured the Holocaust. Sheinberg saw significant opportunity in the music industry and led MCA Music Entertainment's (later renamed Universal Music Group) acquisition of Motown in 1988 for $61 million and Geffen Records in 1990 for $550 million. In 1982, Sheinberg was quoted \n\n Lucas and Spielberg had intended to make a trilogy of Indiana Jones films since Lucas had first pitched Raiders of the Lost Ark to Spielberg in 1977. After the mixed critical and public reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise to Lucas, with the intent to invoke the film with the spirit and tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Throughout the film's development and pre-production, Spielberg admitted he was \"consciously regressing\" in making the film. Due to his commitment to the film, the director had to drop out of directing Big and \n\n Steven Spielberg in 1991. After seeing the television film Wildflower, Spielberg hired Kamiński to shoot Class of '61, a television film in which Spielberg served as producer. He twice won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in the 1990s, for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. He has been nominated four additional times for Amistad, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, War Horse and Lincoln. In 2010, he was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by the AFI Conservatory. Kamiński became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) in 1994, but resigned in 2006. Kamiński was married to actress Holly Hunter from 1995 until 2001. He married ABC reporter Rebecca Rankin in 2004. They divorced in 2010.\n\n Janusz Zygmunt Kamiński (born June 27, 1959) is a Polish cinematographer and director of film and television, who started his career in the United States. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his work on Schindler's List (1993). He has established a partnership with Steven Spielberg, working as a cinematographer on his films since 1993. He won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan (1998). In recent years, Kamiński has also moved into the field of directing, first with the horror film Lost Souls, and later television series like The Event and The Divide. In 2019, the American Society of Cinematographers included Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, both shot by Kamiński, on the list of the best-photographed films of the 20th century.\n\nQuestion: Who directed the films Thelma and Louise, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This version depicts Netley as semi-literate, and horrified by Gull's plans. In the 2001 film adaptation of From Hell, starring Johnny Depp, Netley was played by Jason Flemyng.

The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional Sherlock Holmes who uncovered the conspiracy in Murder By Decree and instead concentrates on the real-life Whitechapel detective Frederick Abberline, as assisted by Sergeant George Godley. The series is constructed as a Whodunit in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that Prince Albert Victor, Richard Mansfield, George Lusk, Henry Llewellyn or Theodore Dyke Acland could be Jack the Ripper. Before Jack the Ripper was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the Scotland Yard files on the Ripper \n\n story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' Jack the Ripper series. Using historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, Jack the Ripper was written by Derek Marlowe and David Wickes and directed by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited Masonic/Royal Family conspiracy theory as the 1978 film Murder By Decree; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film From Hell. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by Thomas E. A. Stowell who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of The Criminologist.

In the 1988 made-for-TV mini-series Jack the Ripper, which followed the same conspiracy theory as Murder by Decree, he was played by Hugh Fraser. The mini-series shows his final act as commissioner ordering lead detective Fred Abberline to suppress his findings on the investigation in order to protect the royal family from scandal. In the 2001 film From Hell he was played by Ian Richardson.\n\nQuestion: Which serial killer is the subject of the films A Study In Terror, Murder By Decree and From Hell?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The soundtrack also includes \"Face to Face\", a song written by the band Siouxsie and the Banshees and Elfman, that was used to promote the movie. Two versions of the music video were made (the other added shots from the movie), and a club version, remixed by 808 State, was released. Elfman added chorus to the main theme making it similar but not as dark as the original.\n\n Batman Returns is a 1992 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Denise Di Novi and Burton, based on the DC Comics character Batman. The sequel to the 1989 film Batman, it is the second installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series, and stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Michael Murphy, and Vincent Schiavelli. In Batman Returns, Batman faces the Penguin, who plots to kill all of Gotham City's firstborn sons, while dealing with Max Shreck, a corrupt tycoon who allies with the Penguin to bring Gotham City under his control, and Catwoman, who seeks vengeance against Shreck.

It is the third book of Robinson's \"RAF Quartet\", which began with Piece of Cake in 1983 and continued with A Good Clean Fight in 1993. Skull Skelton, a character in those earlier novels, is one of the protagonists of Damned Good Show. Like all of Robinson's novels, Damned Good Show points out the inadequacies of the pre-war establishment and the many hurdles that Bomber Command had to overcome during the course of the war, such as inadequate aircraft—in this case the Handley Page Hampden, and the inaccuracy of the night-time bombing raids on Germany.\n\n Toast: The Story of a Boy's Hunger, a moving and award-winning autobiography focused on his love of food, his childhood, his family relationships (his mother died of asthma when he was nine) and his burgeoning homosexuality. Slater has called it \"the most intimate memoir that any food person has ever written\". Toast was published in Britain in October 2004 and became a best-seller after it was featured on the Richard & Judy Book Club. As he told The Observer, \"The last bit of the book is very foody. But that is how it was. Towards the end I finally get rid of these two people in my life I did not like [his father and stepmother, who had been the family's cleaning lady]—and to be honest I was really very jubilant—and thereafter all I wanted to do was cook.\"\n\n 1956 the book was made into the British film Soho Incident (released in the United States as Spin a Dark Web). In 2008 London Books republished Wide Boys Never Work as part of their London Books classics series. Before then, M. Benny had published, in 1936, the novel 'Low Company', (published by 'P. Davies', of London). His account of his early life was entitled A Magnum for my Mother (1946). To the British public, a magnum just meant a large bottle of champagne. However, in the USA it could suggest a type of handgun, so it was retitled Champagne for Mother (1947).\n\nBachelor Boys: The Young Ones Book (1984) (with Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer) ; Stark (1989), UK No 1 ; Gridlock (1991), UK No 1 ; This Other Eden (1993), UK No 1 ; Popcorn (1996), UK No 1 and Crime Writers' Association of Great Britain Gold Dagger Award for fiction ; Blast from the Past (1998), UK Top 5 ; Inconceivable (1999), UK Top 5 (later made into a film, see below) ; Dead Famous (2001), UK Top 1 ; High Society (2002), UK No 1 and WH Smith's People Choice Fiction Award ; Past Mortem (2004), UK Top 5 ; The \n\n Lost Boys (1992) is a horror novel by American author Orson Scott Card.

The story primarily follows the family's troubles at work, church, and the oldest child Stevie's difficulty fitting in at school, which lead to him becoming increasingly withdrawn. Dealing with themes such as religion and the nature of good and evil, the novel is an expansion of Card's short story \"Lost Boys\".

In poker, this could translate to: \"How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?\". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, \n\n single-deck games better for counters. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the cards every time a deck has been played. Card counting is legal unless the counter is using an external device, but a casino might inform counters that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property. The use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal throughout the United States.\n\n This is a draw game that plays much like a stud game. First five cards are dealt to each player, followed by a betting round, and a draw. Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a rollout phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves. Each player's top card is now revealed, followed by a betting round. Then each player reveals his next card, followed by a betting round. Then a third card is revealed, followed by a betting round, a fourth card, a betting round, and finally a showdown. Players may not change the order of their cards at any time during the rollout phase. This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at high-low split, in which case it is called \"Skinny Minnie\".\n\n Haggis is a shedding card game similar to Tichu, Zheng Fen, and other East Asian climbing games. Haggis has received praise for being the first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start for two to three players, where most previous games required four players or more. The evenly distributed, face card \"bombs\" are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game. The game's designer, Sean Ross, developed Haggis over a period of several years, with first publication in late 2010 by Indie Boards and Cards. The game was named after haggis partly in a nod to Ross' Scottish heritage, but also because the game brought together the \"guts\" (scoring and play mechanisms) of several other climbing games. Haggis was a nominee for \"Best Card Game\" in the 2010 Golden Geek Awards by BoardGameGeek.\n\n Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game allows players to construct a sensei deck in addition to the main playing deck (known as a life deck), which requires the use of a sensei card. The sensei card counts toward the life deck minimum and maximum size, but cards in the sensei deck do not. The sensei card specifies the maximum size of the sensei deck. When cards are exchanged between the two decks, the player must show the sensei cards to all opponents for confirmation, but need not show the cards removed from the life deck. The cards removed must be taken from the top of the life deck, then the sensei cards must be shuffled into the life deck. If the player fails to remove the sensei cards from the life deck before the subsequent game begins, that game is forfeited to the opponent.\n\nQuestion: With which game would you use a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51 mm?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The chorus is much better known than the verses to later generations. The lyrics of the refrain:  The song has become a pop standard with many recordings made. One of the first was made by Dan W. Quinn for Berliner Gramophone in 1895, which is the same year the song was first published. The song was later featured in many films, including Raoul Walsh's The Strawberry Blonde (1941), the title of which was inspired by the lyrics, and Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951).\n\n The song tells of the wedding of two teenagers and their lifestyle afterward. Living in a modest apartment furnished with items bought on sale at Sears, Roebuck and Co., including a \"coolerator\" (refrigerator), the young man finds work and they begin to enjoy relative prosperity. Eventually they purchase a \"souped-up jitney\" (an automobile modified for high performance) and travel to New Orleans, where their wedding had taken place, to celebrate their anniversary. Each verse ends with the refrain, \"'C'est la vie,' say the old folks, 'it goes to show you never can tell.'\" The piano melody was influenced by Mitchell Torok's 1953 hit \"Caribbean\".\n\nThe Girlie Wants a Song ; Music by Milan Kymlicka, Lyrics by Gerald Potterton ; The Birthday Contest Medley ; Music by Milan Kymlicka, Lyrics by Gerald Potterton ; Happy Birthday to You ; Used by permission Warner Bros. Music, Written by Patty Hill and Mildred J. Hill \n\n Mildred Jane Hill, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the oldest of three sisters, Mildred, Patty, and Jessica. She learned music from her father, Calvin Cody, and Adolph Weidig. It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher, like her younger sister Patty. Prof. Robert Brauneis, after extensively researching the Hill family, has concluded that she was not a kindergarten teacher. She moved into music, teaching, composing, performing, and specializing in the study of Negro spirituals. Hill and her sister were honored at the Chicago World's Fair (1893) for their work in the progressive education program at the experimental kindergarten, the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School. She wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor, and her 1892 article \"Negro Music\", suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style, influenced Dvořák in composing the New World Symphony. Hill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Mildred Hill's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n While teaching at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School, the Hill sisters wrote the song \"Good Morning to All\"; Mildred wrote the melody, and Patty the lyrics. The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students. Song Stories for the Kindergarten had over 20 editions, and the words were translated into French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Swedish. \"Happy Birthday to You\" first appeared in print in 1912 using the melody of \"Good Morning to All\" with different lyrics. Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s, with no author identified for the new lyrics, nor credit given for the melody from \"Good Morning to You\". Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company, and a series of court cases (which all settled out of court), the sisters became known as the authors of \"Happy Birthday to You\". In September 2015, a federal judge declared that \"Happy Birthday to You\" is in the public domain.\n\nQuestion: The melody for which famous song was written by sisters and school teachers Patty and Mildred Hill in Kentucky in 1893?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The principal examples of this are \"The Moon Under Water\", commonly used by the JD Wetherspoon chain (and inspired by George Orwell's 1946 essay in the Evening Standard, \"The Moon Under Water\"), and the \"Tap and Spile\" brand name used by the now defunct Century Inns chain. The \"Slug and Lettuce\" is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand; founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, to which he gave humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors.\n\n The ubiquity of heraldic pub names shows how important heraldry has been in the naming of pubs. The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names. Five common colours (heraldic tinctures) are gules (red); sable (black); azure (blue); vert (green); and purpure (purple). The metals are or (gold) and argent (silver), although in practice they are usually depicted as yellow and white.\n\n are popular pub signs and names. ; Red Dragon of Cadwaladr: the symbol of Wales, and a heraldic badge of Henry VII and many other royal figures. ; Red Lion is the name of over 600 pubs. It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. The lion is one of the most common charges in coats of arms, second only to the cross, and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or crest of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of John of Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster; or in the royal arms \n\n  Pub names are used to identify and differentiate traditional drinking establishments. Many pubs (public houses) are centuries old, and were named at a time when most of their customers were illiterate, but could recognise pub signs. The use of signage was not confined to drinking establishments. British pubs may be named after and depict anything from everyday (particularly agricultural) objects, to sovereigns, aristocrats and landowners (shown by their coats of arms). Other names come from historic events, livery companies, occupations, sports, and craftsmen's guilds. One of the most common pub names is the Red Lion. Irish pubs tend to be named after the current or former owner. In Australia a high proportion of older pubs have names ending in \"hotel\", and generally their names reflect hotel naming conventions.\n\n Arms (245) ; 10) Ship (244) An authoritative list of the most common pub names in Great Britain is hard to establish, owing to ambiguity in what classifies as a pub as opposed to a licensed restaurant or nightclub, and so lists of this form tend to vary hugely. The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and CAMRA. According to BBPA, the most common names are:  and according to CAMRA they are:  A more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names.

Kevin eventually became a successful lawyer, but failed to make partner. He was out to his family as well as to the legal world, but struggled with romantic relationships. Several years before the start of the show, Kevin was in a relationship with another man which ended with enough regret that Kevin kept a framed photo of the two of them in his office. Kevin also implied that in his past, he had had problems staying faithful in a relationship and slept around with other random men at times.\n\n After Kevin joined Tommy and Sarah on a road trip to track down the missing pension fund, their car broke down and they were stranded at a military bar. A soldier who flirted with Kevin at the bar agreed to let them stay at his place, and he had a one-night stand with Kevin in the process. They soon found the money their father had hidden away, and the family business was saved. The family harmony was strained when Kevin found out that Kitty was going to work for a senator (Rob Lowe) who had voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In the process, Kevin realized Kitty herself was opposed to gay marriage, although she supported civil unions. A stung Kevin grudgingly accepted her decision, but was infuriated when Kitty began seeing the senator socially. As a result, Kevin and Kitty became somewhat estranged for a time.\n\n Kevin originated in 1990 in the \"Little Brother\" sketches of Harry Enfield's Television Programme as an annoyingly energetic young boy who constantly vexed his older brother with his irritating catchphrases and habit of bursting into his room when he was with a girl, to bother their activities. In the first episode of Harry Enfield and Chums (the follow-up series, in November 1994), Kevin is excited at being nearly thirteen. The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. Unlike the previous sketches which included an older brother, this incarnation of Kevin is implied to be an only child.\n\n room when required to do so.

Firstly, it simplifies the process of reverse complementation, which is a commonly performed manipulation of genetic sequences. This notation aids in quickly identifying the complementary sequence of a given DNA or RNA strand, which is useful in various genetic analyses.\n\nSecondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences.\n\nFurthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine. This highlighting mechanism can be particularly beneficial in genetic research to identify and study regions with high GC content, as these regions often have specific structural and functional properties.\n\nIn addition, the ambigraphic notation supports the derivation of ambiguity characters, which are symbols used to represent multiple possible nucleotides at a given position in a genetic sequence. This flexibility is valuable in cases where the exact nucleotide at a particular position is uncertain or variable.\n\nLastly, the ambigraphic nucleic acid notation can also be helpful in educational settings. Its design aids educators in teaching the fundamentals of molecular genetics, making complex concepts more accessible to students.\n\nIn summary, the advantages of using ambigraphic nucleic acid notation in genetic sequences include simplifying reverse complementation, aiding the visualization of palindromes, highlighting GC-rich regions, supporting ambiguity character derivation, and facilitating education in molecular genetics.\n\nPalindromic DNA refers to a specific sequence of nucleotides within a DNA molecule that reads the same way forwards and backwards. These sequences are known as palindromic sequences and have a symmetrical structure. Palindromic DNA sequences typically consist of complementary base pairs, such as adenine (A) with thymine (T) and guanine (G) with cytosine (C). \n\nPalindromic DNA sequences are important in various biological processes, particularly in DNA replication and in the function of certain enzymes called restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes recognize and bind to specific palindromic DNA sequences, where they can then cut the DNA molecule at that site. This restriction of DNA can be used in genetic engineering techniques, such as the creation of recombinant DNA or for analysis of DNA through techniques like restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).\n\nAdditionally, palindromic DNA sequences can also form structures called palindromic hairpins. In these hairpin structures, the palindromic sequence folds back on itself and base pairs with complementary regions in the DNA, forming a stem-loop structure. Palindromic hairpins can affect various genetic processes, including DNA repair, recombination, and transcription regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, palindromic DNA sequences are symmetrical sequences within DNA that read the same forwards and backwards. They play a crucial role in DNA replication, genetic engineering techniques, and various genetic processes.\n\n Kaibun (回文; literally circle sentence) is a Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. The unit of kaibun is mora, since the Japanese language uses syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Single word palindromes are not uncommon in Japanese. For example, Ku-ku (九九, multiplication table), Shi-n-bu-n-shi (新聞紙, newspaper), to-ma-to (トマト, tomato), etc. So kaibun usually refers to a palindromic sentence, but a passage can be a kaibun too. The topic marker \"wa\" (は) can be treated as \"ha\" and small kana ゃ,ゅ and ょ are usually allowed to be interpreted as big kana や, ゆ and よ. In classics, diacritic marks are often ignored. Rather than saying \"read the same forwards and backwards\", because Japanese is traditionally written vertically, Japanese people describe the word as being the same when read from the top (ue kara yomu) as when read from the bottom (shita kara yomu).\n\n yātayā tarasā cārustanayānaghayā śritaṃ The 34th stanza is the 33rd stanza written backwards, with a different meaning. Finally, the 27th stanza is an example of what has been called \"the most complex and exquisite type of palindrome ever invented\". It may also be thought of as a syllabic Sator Square. Sanskrit aestheticians call it sarvatobhadra, \"perfect in every direction\" — it yields the same text if read forwards, backwards, down, or up: सकारनानारकास- कायसाददसायका । रसाहवा वाहसार- नादवाददवादना ॥ sakāranānārakāsa- kāyasādadasāyakā rasāhavā vāhasāra- nādavādadavādanā. \"\"[That army], which relished battle (rasāhavā) contained allies who brought low the bodes and gaits of their various striving \n\nThe term \"palindrome\" is often associated with a sequence of DNA. In genetics, a palindrome refers to a DNA sequence that reads the same way forward and backward. This means that both strands of the double-stranded DNA molecule have the same sequence when read in opposite directions. Palindromic DNA sequences are significant in molecular biology and genetics because they often serve as recognition sites for DNA-binding proteins, such as restriction enzymes that cut DNA at specific sites. These palindromic sequences play essential roles in various DNA-based processes, including DNA replication, recombination, and repair. They are also valuable in molecular cloning techniques. By utilizing the recognition and binding properties of palindromic DNA sequences, scientists can manipulate and study DNA in laboratory settings.\n\nQuestion: What seven letter word, beginning with the letters 'Ra' is a palindrome?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

James Joyce, author of Ulysses, is another noted word-player. For example, in his Finnegans Wake Joyce's phrase \"they were yung and easily freudened\" clearly implies the more conventional \"they were young and easily frightened\"; however, the former also makes an apt pun on the names of two famous psychoanalysts, Jung and Freud. An epitaph, probably unassigned to any grave, demonstrates use in rhyme. Crossword puzzles often employ wordplay to challenge solvers. Cryptic crosswords especially are based on elaborate systems of wordplay. An example of modern word play can be found on line 103 of Childish Gambino's \"III. Life: The Biggest Troll\".\"H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it\" Rapper Milo uses a play \n\n  Word play or wordplay (also: play-on-words) is a literary technique and a form of wit in which words used become the main subject of the work, primarily for the purpose of intended effect or amusement. Examples of word play include puns, phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms, obscure words and meanings, clever rhetorical excursions, oddly formed sentences, double entendres, and telling character names (such as in the play The Importance of Being Earnest, Ernest being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective earnest). Word play is quite common in oral cultures as a method of reinforcing meaning. Examples of text-based (orthographic) word play are found in languages with or without alphabet-based scripts, such as homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nIn some instances an individual will completely recover from Broca’s aphasia without treatment. When treatment is necessary, the most common treatment is therapy designed to improve an individual's ability to communicate by helping the person to use remaining abilities, to restore language abilities as much as possible, to compensate for language problems, and to learn other methods of communicating.\nThe primary treatment for most causes of Broca’s aphasia is speech therapy, which is begun as soon as the patient's condition allows. There are no drugs available to cure or treat Broca’s aphasia. The speech therapist works with the patient to strengthen his or her remaining language skills and to find ways to compensate for the skills that have been lost. Techniques might include exercising the facial muscles, repetition of words, using flash cards to improve memory of object names, using pictures of objects and activities to communicate with others, completing reading and writing exercises in workbooks, and using computer programs to aid in speech, hearing, and reading comprehension, as well as recall.\nRecovery from aphasia depends upon the severity of the brain injury. More than half of the patients who have symptoms of aphasia after a stroke, infection, head injury, or as a result of a brain tumor will recover. While people who are left handed are more likely to develop aphasia after a brain injury, they tend to recover more fully. This is because they have language centers on the right and left side of the brain so language abilities can be recovered from either side. Surgery is only used to treat the cause of aphasia, such as to reduce pressure from a brain tumor or to reduce swelling from head trauma.\nTap foot, hands or use metronome to create pace and maintain fluency.\nRelaxation may help with overdone effort.\nTaking a deep breath before speaking may help to relax speech muscles.\nUse words meaningful to the patient.\nUse imitation. The clinician starts with short phrases and sentences and gradually expands the length.\nArticulation Therapy stressing placement for sounds.\nBuild on what the patient uses by adding to their utterances.\nImitating the speech of clinician. Start with short sentences and gradually add to the length.\nStart with repetition of words.\nProgress to 2 word phrases.\nProgress to three word sentences and beyond when ready.\nStart slow and work toward normal speech rhythm.\nAnswering questions from a story or picture.\nRequire patient to name pictures or objects.\nProvide prompts and cues to lead patient in the direction of the intended word. These cues may include: the first sound of the word, sentence completion, it rhymes with, function, location, word spelled out loud, and synonym/antonym.\nChoose words that are useful to the patient.\nWork on carryover by giving the caretaker a list of words that were worked on with success in the therapy session as well as techniques used for elicitation.\nWork on categories, associations, word combinations.\nUse pictures that have meaning to the patient. Family picture albums can help with important names.\nWork on production techniques addressed previously.\nUse pictures showing syntactic structures.\nAct out sentences and stories.\nStart with short stories that have a lot of pictures.\nUse materials that have meaning to the patient-for instance, a church bulletin from their church, a grocery add from the paper, a letter from a friend, the horoscope, a section of the paper that they are interested in, a greeting card, etc.\nAsk questions while as they are reading to reinforce meaning.\nUse techniques as you would for a beginning writer. Depending on the level that the patient is functioning, pointing out letters that the clinician sounds out sounding may be the beginning point. After that is mastered, tracing letters, copying letters and then writing letters should be performed. Then the clinician spells words letter by letter, says words and the patient writes them and copies structured sentences. Finally, the patient writes sentences to dictation and writes sentences using words from the clinician.\nTeach survival writing skills. These include: signing forms, writing shopping lists, writing checks, writing notes to friends in cards or letters.\nPractice drills with words used for the above purposes.\nb. Use drawings to show placements of sounds.\ncommunication has little meaning to them.\nf. Repetition drills for sounds, words, phrases and sentences. Start with sounds.\ng. Use of an alternative communication device may be helpful.\nh. Neurobehavioral reorganization approaches to treatment can be taught, such as the use of gestures and melodic intonation therapy.\ni. Many repetitions are needed to stabilize newly acquired responses and make them automatic.\nj. Intensive treatment is required and should consist of massed practice over a long time.\nk. Treatment of prosody should accompany articulation treatment.\nRespiration exercises may be needed.\nModification of muscle tone. Progressive relaxation, shaking and chewing exercises, biofeedback.\nAdjust utterance length to match the patient’s respiratory capacity.\nContrastive stress drills.

The fourth tier was known as the Third Division from 1994 until 2013. The Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League, with the fourth tier becoming known as the Scottish League Two.\n\n The 2017–18 Scottish Challenge Cup, known as the IRN-BRU Cup due to sponsorship reasons, is the 27th season of the competition. The tournament took on a similar format from the previous season, however, two teams from the Republic of Ireland's Airtricity League (Sligo Rovers and Bray Wanderers) entered the competition for the first time taking the total number of participating clubs to 56. This was the second season with two clubs from both Northern Ireland and Wales competing alongside the 30 members of the 2017–18 Scottish Championship, 2017–18 Scottish League One and 2017–18 Scottish League Two, four teams from the 2017–18 Highland Football League and four from the 2017–18 Lowland Football League as well as the Under-20 teams of the teams competing in the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership. The Welsh teams were The New Saints and Connah's Quay Nomads while the Northern Irish teams were Crusaders and Linfield. Dundee United were the defending champions after they beat St Mirren 2–1 in the 2017 final, but were eliminated in the Quarter-finals by Crusaders. Irn Bru replaced Petrofac as the main sponsor of the competition in June 2016.\n\n This is a list of Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) managers, in order of the date of their appointment. The SPFL has 42 member clubs and is split into four divisions; the Premiership (12 clubs), the Championship (10), League One (10), and League Two (10).\n\n The 2020–21 Scottish Premiership was the eighth season of the Scottish Premiership, the highest division of Scottish football (the 124th edition overall of the top national league competition, not including one cancelled due to World War II). The fixtures were published on 6 July 2020, with the season beginning on 1 August, following Scottish Government approval due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. Twelve teams contested the league: Aberdeen, Celtic, Dundee United, Hamilton Academical, Hibernian, Kilmarnock, Livingston, Motherwell, Rangers, Ross County, St Johnstone and St Mirren. Celtic were the defending champions, seeking a record-breaking tenth successive title. On 7 March, Rangers clinched the title (their first in the Premiership, and 55th Scottish championship overall including one shared) after Celtic drew 0–0 away to Dundee United with 6 games remaining. This is the earliest date the Premiership has been won, with Rangers also completing an unbeaten league season on 15 May 2021 after a 4–0 win against Aberdeen.\n\n The 2019–20 Scottish Championship (known as Ladbrokes Championship for sponsorship reasons) was the 25th season in the current format of 10 teams in the second-tier of Scottish football. Ten teams contested the league: Alloa Athletic, Arbroath, Ayr United, Dundee, Dundee United, Dunfermline Athletic, Greenock Morton, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Partick Thistle and Queen of the South. The season began on 3 August 2019 and was scheduled to end on 2 May 2020. On 13 March 2020 all SPFL leagues were indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. On 8 April 2020, the SPFL proposed to end the 2019&ndash;20 season by utilising a points per game ratio to determine the final standings. The plan was approved on 15 April 2020, declaring that the season was over, as Dundee United were declared title winners with Partick Thistle relegated to League One. Partick Thistle joined Heart of Midlothian F.C. (which had been relegated from the Scottish Premiership under similar circumstances) in suing the Scottish Professional Football League on the grounds that their relegation was unfair; Partick was two points behind the second-to-last-place team but had played one less game. Ultimately, the lawsuit failed and Partick and Hearts were indeed relegated.\n\nQuestion: How many scottish football league teams names end in United?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

MacLeod came back to the U.K. in the new year to see Donovan and, a few weeks later, the rest of the band followed. After hearing Donovan's demo tape, the band set up outside his Little Berkhamsted cottage and played their version of the song. Donovan did not like the heavy take on the track they played as he wanted a softer, acoustic arrangement. Soon after, he released his own version of the song which became a hit, his version in the end had a similar arrangement to the Hurdy Gurdy version. Donovan told Keith Altham of the NME (and Hit Parader) in December 1968: \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" was \n\n and \"Colours\" and the \"Universal Soldier\" EP. While \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours\" have appeared in various formats throughout Donovan's catalogue, live versions and re-recordings of \"Turquoise\" are conspicuously absent. The relative lack of success in the United Kingdom was most likely the reason leading to Hickory Records selecting \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" as Donovan's next single in the United States. Hickory Records later released \"Turquoise\" as the b-side to \"To Try for the Sun\" and made it the opening track to their 1966 compilation The Real Donovan. The 45 was one of the records in John Lennon's jukebox. The song was written about Donovan's friend Joan Baez, with whom he claimed he was in love. Baez recorded a version of the song in 1967 (album: Joan). The lyric begins: \n\n Greatest Hits is a compilation album by singer Jason Donovan. The album featured all the hit singles by Donovan while he was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. The collection was released in late 2006 to coincide with the singer's appearance on the TV reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. EMI, the record label, had licensed the songs from PWL Records, but missed lesser hits Donovan had on other labels, such as \"Mission of Love\" and \"All Around the World\", although did include the No.1 single \"Any Dream Will Do\" (all originally released through Polydor). As it is, the album contains ten UK top ten hits - four of them No.1s. The album itself charted at a low No.80, although was almost identical to the Greatest Hits collection released in 1991 as well as a budget-priced compilation available since 1999. Donovan also undertook a UK tour to promote the album (entitled The Greatest Hits Tour).\n\n“''Your smile beams like sunlight ; ''On a gull’s wing; and the leaves ; Dance and play after you; ; Take my hand and hold it ; As you would a flower; ; ''Take care with my heart, Oh darling: ; She’s made of glass.” \"Turquoise\" is a song written and recorded by British singer-songwriter Donovan. The \"Turquoise\" single was released in the United Kingdom on 30 October 1965 through Pye Records (Pye 7N 15984) and charted, peaking at No.30. The \"Turquoise\" single was backed with \"Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)\" and only released in the United Kingdom. \"Turquoise\" was released as the b-side on \"To Try for the Sun\" in the United States. \"Turquoise\" marked a significant drop-off in Donovan's UK chart success compared to the top 10 successes of \"Catch the \n\n Donovan followed up the success of \"Catch the Wind\" with \"Colours\", which featured a similar folk style. The single matched the success of \"Catch the Wind\" in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 4 on the charts. In the United States, \"Colours\" reached No.61, and marked a decline in the artist's popularity relative to \"Catch the Wind\". A different mix of the song (without harmonica) was released on his second album Fairytale. Billboard praised the \"intriguing lyric and melody.\" When Epic Records was compiling Donovan's Greatest Hits, they were either unable or unwilling to secure the rights to the original recordings of \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours\". Donovan re-recorded both songs in the studio with Big Jim Sullivan playing guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards and Clem Cattini on drums, produced by Mickie Most.

In Germany, the first transmission of the show aired on ProSieben, where the theme tune was changed to Texas' 2001 version of \"I Don't Want a Lover\", and featured a different title sequence. Deliberately silly and avoiding repetitive catchphrases, the show's surreal humour proved popular and the series had a regular audience of around 2.5 million viewers in the UK. In 2003 the show's leads announced that they would not be continuing with the format, preferring to quit while the show was a success rather than risk diminishing the quality of the material. The trio reunited for a skit in aid of Comic Relief for Red Nose Day 2017.\n\n & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \"Ain't No Pleasing You\". However, their song \"Margate\" was used in a feature-length episode of the series entitled \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\" in 1989. They also created the theme tune and incidental music for the children television show Bangers and Mash, and recorded the title theme for Crackerjack! used in the 1980s. \"Snooker Loopy\", a comic song about snooker, was released as a single in May 1986 and entered the UK Singles Chart, reaching number six.\n\n The show was created by Victoria Pile after being commissioned by Caroline Leddy of Channel 4 and Peter Fincham at Talkback, who believed that audiences would welcome a female orientated sketch show. The show's title was intended as a spoof of the kind of stories that would feature in annuals aimed at young girls. Originally \"Spot the Pony\", it was changed at Kevin Lygo's suggestion to \"Smack the Pony\" which some people mistakenly assumed was some kind of sexual euphemism. A pilot was filmed featuring Sally Phillips, Fiona Allen and Amanda Holden. When a full series was commissioned Holden dropped out and Doon Mackichan took her place. Holden still appeared in four episodes of the first series.

The series revolved around the sitting room of a working-class family and was set in Manchester, the hometown of Oasis. Although it had modest beginnings, the series soon became popular and its theme became well known. The opening credits of the series edited together the first stanza of the first verse and the second stanza of the first chorus. The end credits, which would cut in immediately after the final joke of the episode – so as to add weight to it – began with the second stanza of the final chorus and would see the song through to the coda.

The main performers on the show were Fiona Allen, Doon Mackichan and Sally Phillips. There were also regular appearances from Sarah Alexander, Darren Boyd and Cavan Clerkin. The show's theme tune was a version of the Dusty Springfield song \"In the Middle of Nowhere\", sung by Jackie Clune. In addition to the three principal cast members, the show was written by many writers, the core of which went on to write Green Wing and Campus. Among the show's regular themes were unsuccessful relationships, competition in the workplace and latent lesbianism, but sketches would also dip into the surreal.

Additionally, a player can gain the advantage of serving only through skillful play (viz. \"laying\" a \"chase\", which ensures a change of end). This is in stark contrast to lawn tennis, where players alternately serve and receive entire games. In real tennis the service can only change during a game, and it is not uncommon to see a player serve for several consecutive games till a chase be made. Indeed, in theory, an entire match could be played with no change of service, the \n\n the point. Instead a \"chase\" is called where the ball made its second bounce and the server gets the chance, later in the game, to \"play off\" the chase from the receiving end; but to win the point being played off, their shot's second bounce must be further from the net (closer to the back wall) than the shot they originally failed to reach. A chase can also be called at the receiving (\"hazard\") end, but only on the half of that end nearest the net; this is called a \"hazard\" chase. Those areas of the court in which chases can be called are marked with lines \n\n A let occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object). Play stops immediately, and the serve must be redone. The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred. Lets occur more often on first serves, as the server is more cautious on the success of a second serve. However, in 1997 men's division 1 tennis rules have been modified to play all lets.\n\n After a fair serve the receiver strikes the ball so that it either directly or indirectly hits the front wall before hitting the floor a second time, goes out of bounds, or strikes the tin. Players thus alternate hitting the ball until one fails to make a fair return. The ball can only be played off the back wall if the ball first hits the back wall. A ball may hit anywhere on the back wall if it first bounces off the floor&mdash;otherwise it must stay below the back wall out line. Unintentional interference results in a \"let\"&mdash;the point is replayed.\n\n A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point. A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. Normally players begin a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss). The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a let; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) \n\nQuestion: What word is given to a point in tennis which has to be replayed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Within the canton features a Lion of Saint Mark against a background of diagonal red, white, and green stripes. Following the outbreak of revolt in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia in 1848 and the declaration of independence of the Republic of San Marco by Venetian separatists, the flag was adopted as a symbol of the new republic. Daniele Manin, President of the Republic, decreed on 21 March 1848 that the flag should come to represent the new republic following the end of Austrian rule. The reinstatement of the Lion of Saint Mark was an outward expression of Venetian independence from Austria. By including the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice, the insurrectionists simultaneously demonstrated continuity with the previous republic alongside newfound independence. The usage of a green-white-red tricolour as the basis of the flag was also significant insofar as it signified greater links between the Republic and the wider Italian independence movement. The flag lasted until 27 August 1849 when the Republic of San Marco was returned to Austrian control following the decisive Battle of Novara.\n\n The flag of a harp on a green background was first used by Owen Roe O'Neil in 1642. The change from blue to green started in the 17th century with Owen Roe O'Neill and Confederate Ireland, The colour green became associated with Ireland from the 1640s onwards. The United Irishmen adopted this flag which already had strong associations with Ireland, The united Irishmen was an Irish nationalist movement associated with both Catholic and Protestant Irish – its leader Wolfe Tone was Anglican Protestant; green was a colour of rebellion in the eighteenth century. Since at least the 17th century Ireland has been known by the poetic name the Emerald Isle due to its abundance of green countryside. This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It consisted of a gold cláirseach on a green background. It was associated with moderate nationalism at a time when the tricolour was confined to more radical movements. It is the same as the modern Flag of Leinster. It was used by the Irish team at the 1930 British Empire Games.\n\n The flag is three units long and two units high. The right two-thirds are red, and the remaining third is sky blue. On the top left corner of the flag is a five-pointed red star. The red in the flag stands for the revolutionary zeal of the youth and the sky blue symbolises their desire for peace. The red star stands for revolutionary idealism and honesty and the five corners of the star represent the solidarity and friendship of the youth of all five continents.\n\n used green in their flags to represent their country's lush vegetation, as in the flag of Jamaica, and hope in the future, as in the flags of Portugal and Nigeria. The green cedar of Lebanon tree on the Flag of Lebanon officially represents steadiness and tolerance. Green is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the \"Emerald Isle\". The color is particularly identified with the republican and nationalist traditions in modern times. It is used this way on the flag of the Republic of Ireland, in balance with white and the Protestant orange. Green is a strong trend in the Irish holiday St. Patrick's Day.\n\n The tricolour of green, white and orange, the official flag of the Republic of Ireland, was originally intended by nationalists to represent the entire island. However, this symbolism is rejected by Ulster unionists, as illustrated by an exchange in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1951: -James McSparran (Nationalist Party): The tricolour is admitted by all nations within the comity of nations to be the national flag of Ireland. -Honorable members: No.-McSparran: We are having interruptions already. It is the national flag of the Irish Republic. -William May (Ulster Unionist Party): That is better. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) flies this flag at matches regardless of whether either or both teams are from Northern Ireland. It is also used for the Ireland international rules football team, selected by the GAA on an all-island basis. The Golfing Union of Ireland covers the whole island and competes under the tricolour in international events such as the World Cup, Alfred Dunhill Cup and the Eisenhower Trophy.\n\nQuestion: Which three colours appear on the flag of the Republic of Ireland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is also the first episode of the show's fourth season, and was broadcast on 10 May 2016. The episode's story begins four months after the events of the previous episode, \"Blood and Fire\". \"First Blood\" saw the introduction of Kate Jenkinson's character Allie Novak, former prison Governor Joan (Pamela Rabe) returning as an inmate and the beginning of a rivalry between central character Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) and Kaz Proctor (Tammy Macintosh). The episode also includes scenes set outside the prison, which follow Franky Doyle (Nicole da Silva), a former inmate who is released on parole. It was the first episode of the show to be filmed at a new rebuilt set. It has received generally positive reviews from television critics. Reviews regarding scenes in which Joan is incarcerated in a glass-walled cell were less favourable.\n\n The Prisoner is a 17-episode British television series broadcast in the UK from 29 September 1967 to 1 February 1968. Starring and co-created by Patrick McGoohan, it combined spy fiction with elements of science fiction, allegory, and psychological drama. Since its debut, the series' enduring popularity has led to its influencing and being referenced in a range of other media, such as the film The Truman Show, and the television shows Lost and The X-Files. The producer of The X-Files called The Prisoner \"the Gone with the Wind of its genre.\" The Guardian wrote that \"Without The Prisoner, we'd never have had cryptic, mindbending TV series like Twin Peaks or Lost. It's the Citizen Kane of British TV – a programme that changed the landscape.\" For references to The Prisoner in other media see The Prisoner in other media.\n\n Prisoner was created by Reg Watson, who had produced the British soap opera Crossroads from 1964 to 1973 and would create Australian soaps The Young Doctors, Sons and Daughters and Neighbours. Inspired by the British television drama Within These Walls, the show was initially conceived as a 16-episode series, with a pilot episode bearing the working title \"Women Behind Bars\". Its storylines focused on the lives of the prisoners and, to a lesser extent, the officers and other prison staff. When the initial episodes met an enthusiastic reception, it was felt that Prisoner could be developed into an ongoing soap opera. The early storylines were developed and expanded, with assistance from the Corrective Services Department.

The series was produced by the Grundy Organisation and was filmed at the then Network Ten Melbourne Studios at Nunawading and on location. It was the first series in Australia to gain an international cult following, particularly in the United States and Canada (as Prisoner: Cell Block H). It also built a large audience in Europe - especially the United Kingdom and Sweden. Sammy Davis Jr., was a major fan and visited the set.

Hughes and Fred Perry won the doubles at the French Championships in 1933 and at the Australian Championships in 1934. Hughes later teamed up with Raymond Tuckey. They won the doubles in Wimbledon in 1936. Hughes reached the semi finals at Roland Garros in 1931, where he beat Vernon Kirby and George Lott before losing to Christian Boussus. Between 1929 and 1936 Hughes was a member of the British Davis Cup team. Hughes had been the only British man to reach the singles final at the Italian championships, capturing the title in 1931 and runner-up the following year, until Andy Murray won the tournament in 2016. Hughes captured the doubles title in both those years too, when the tournament, in its infancy, was played in Milan. He was the editor of the Dunlop Lawn Tennis Annual and Almanack from the late 1940s to the late 1950s. He worked for years in London as the Vice President of Dunlop Sporting Goods World Wide.\n\n At the Australian Open in December 1977, Lloyd became the first British male tennis player in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam singles final. He lost in five sets to America's Vitas Gerulaitis 6–3, 7–6, 5–7, 3–6, 6–2. No other British player reached a Grand Slam final for 20 years, until British-Canadian Greg Rusedski reached the US Open final in 1997. In 1984 he reached the quarter-finals of the US Open. Lloyd never progressed beyond the third round in singles play at Wimbledon. Though he never won a Grand Slam singles title, Lloyd did win three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles partnering Australia's \n\n This a list of career achievements by Andy Murray. At the 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British player since 1977, and the first British man since 1936, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, when he defeated Novak Djokovic in the final in five sets. This title made him the only British male to become a Grand Slam singles champion during the Open Era. On 7 July 2013, Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first British player to win a Wimbledon senior singles title since Virginia Wade in 1977, and the first British man to win the Men's Singles Championship since Fred Perry, 77 years previously.

Koninck was born in Amsterdam, the son of a goldsmith, originally from Antwerp, and was a nephew of Philips de Koninck. Salomon became a pupil of Pieter Lastman, David Colijns, François Venants and Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert. From 1630 he was a member of the Sint Lucasgilde. He moved in the circles of Rembrandt and the academy of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, making many copies of Rembrandt's compositions. His paintings have a warm colour palette and include many \"philosophers\" or scholars. Perhaps one of the better known of these is the Philosopher with an Open Book at the Louvre that was long attributed to Rembrandt and served as companion piece to Rembrandt's Philosopher in Meditation. He married a daughter of Adriaen van Nieulandt and later a sister of Antonie van Stralen. He died in Amsterdam in 1656.\n\n Hendrick Goltzius, or Hendrik, (January or February 1558 – 1 January 1617) was a German-born Dutch printmaker, draftsman, and painter. He was the leading Dutch engraver of the early Baroque period, or Northern Mannerism, lauded for his sophisticated technique, technical mastership and \"exuberance\" of his compositions. According to A. Hyatt Mayor, Goltzius \"was the last professional engraver who drew with the authority of a good painter and the last who invented many pictures for others to copy\". In the middle of his life he also began to produce paintings.\n\n Rienk Jelgerhuis (13 April 1729 – 17 April 1806) was a Dutch painter, engraver and draftsman. Jelgerhuis was born in Leeuwarden. He mainly made his fame as a travelling portrait-painter and has no fewer than 7,763 portraits standing to his credit. He taught his son, Johannes Jelgerhuis, who became an accomplished painter, illustrator and actor. Rienk Jelgerhuis died in Amsterdam.\n\nNovember – The Dutch Gift: a collection including 28 mostly Italian Renaissance paintings and a dozen classical sculptures is presented to the newly restored King Charles II of England by the States-General of the Netherlands. ; To circumvent restrictions placed by the Amsterdam painters' guild on bankrupts trading as painters, Rembrandt's son Titus van Rijn and mistress Hendrickje Stoffels set up a business as art dealers, nominally employing Rembrandt. \n\n Nicolaes Ruts (1573-1638) was born in Cologne and became an Amsterdam Mennonite merchant who frequently traded with the Russian colony at Arkhangelsk. He is notable for having been the subject of a well-known portrait by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn in 1631, at the age of 58. The painting of him was done in oil on a mahogany panel, and measures 46 x 34 in (116.8 x 87.3 cm). In it, Ruts is depicted in a sable-lined tabbaard (Dutch gown), translucent neck ruff, and Russian ushanka hat, holding an illegible note in his ungloved left hand and looking directly at the viewer, his right resting on the back of a red chair. The portrait is stored in the Frick Collection. It is one of Rembrandt's earliest commissioned pieces and helped launch his career as a portrait painter. Ruts was not a particularly successful merchant, and filed for bankruptcy shortly before he died. The portrait may have been commissioned by his daughter Susanna who together with her husband was quite successful in this line of work.\n\nQuestion: Which famous painter's surname was Harmenzoon van Rijn which translated as son of Harmen, of the Rhine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Her last competition in Artistic gymnastics was the National Championship from 1997, where she won five medals: two gold (in floor and all around), two silver (in beam and parallel bars) and one silver (in vault). Despite the fact that she was a talented gymnast, she didn't make it to the 1996 Olympic \n\n to the food.

Gymnastics is responsible for the majority of Romania's Olympic medals, gold, silver, and bronze. The most famous Romanian gymnast is Nadia Comăneci, who was the first gymnast to ever score a perfect 10 at the Olympic Games, during the 1976 Summer Olympics. She also won three gold medals, one silver, and one bronze, all at the age of fourteen. Her success continued in the 1980 Summer Olympics, winning two gold medals and two silver medals. At the 1976 Olympic Games, Teodora Ungureanu did very well too, but did not receive as much fame as Nadia.

However, she was considered for the Olympics in 2000. After her retirement from WAG, Aurelia started with fitness. In this sport, she won 3rd place at the National Championships in 1998. But she wanted to do more, and in parallel Aurelia started with aerobic gymnastics, a young sport at that time. Her first appearance, after only 6 months of training, was at the National Championships, where she took the bronze medal. At the age of 17 (1999), Aurelia was hit by a car when crossing the street. She stayed in the hospital for one month with severe trauma and fractures. Doctors told her she would not be \n\n solemn meetings and made other arrangements to honor their visit. Although in the event finals of the 1958 Worlds Manina, apart from the gold in the team competition, won a silver medal, on vault, she placed 3rd in the all-around to Latynina and Eva Bosáková. She missed the 1960 Summer Olympics due to an injury, but competed in the 1962 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, contributing to the team's gold and winning the bronze on vault. At age 30 she went to the 1964 Summer Olympics and won the team's gold and silver on the balance beam. Finishing her competitive career, Manina seriously injured her ankle during the display competition in Vienna and was not able to continue training afterward. She \n\n to the food. The goal was that she should be in the first six gymnasts at the next National, which she succeeded. After she turned 18, she was called to the national team for a test period. Aurelia worked hard and remain as a member of the national team until after the World Championships in 2004. Her accomplishments in aerobic gymnastics are 5 medals in World Championship (4 gold and 1 silver) and 2 medals in European Championships.

In 1928, she won the silver medal as member of the Italian gymnastics team and was therefore among the first Italian women to win an Olympic medal. She was also the last surviving athlete from 1928 Summer Games. Marangoni died on 18 January 2018 at the age of 102 years. She was the 6th and last youngest medalist from the Olympic Games (12 years and 270 days) until the silver medal in skateboarding from the Brazilian Rayssa Leal in 2021 (13 years and 203 days).\n\n Luigina Giavotti (October 12, 1916 &ndash; August 4, 1976) was an Italian gymnast who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics.

She was the youngest medalist of the Amsterdam Games and also the youngest female Olympic medalist of all time at the age of 11 years and 302 days. Her record cannot be beaten because the current rules for gymnasts in the Olympics say that they must be at least 16 years old in order to compete.\n\nQuestion: In years and days, how old was Luigina Giavotti when she won a silver medal in gymnastics in 1928, and is still the youngest medal winner today?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He managed to register the \"Duff\" trademark in Mexico, as well as the domain name DuffDeMexico.com. Contreras designed the bottle to be identical to the one portrayed on The Simpsons. The bottle can be seen at his website. The beer is currently available at a few bars, but Contreras has stated his intention of selling it at convenience stores and even exporting it to the United States. This case has been featured on several Mexican newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the novelty the beer represents, rather than the legal implications of it. The \"Duff\" trademark was not registered in Mexico before Contreras registered it; however, Mexican intellectual property law recognizes the concept of \"brand notoriety\", which states that if any brand is well known by a specific section of the consumers or the industry due to the commercial activities or advertisement done by its owners, they have the right to claim the ownership of the trademark. Since its inception, the Mexican brand Duff has spread to other countries in Latin-America like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, among others.\n\n In the mid 1990s, the Lion Nathan brewery in Australia produced a beer called Duff. 20th Century Fox brought legal action against the company.

The beer became a collectors' item in the process, with one case selling for US$13,000. Duff Beer UG's beer was introduced in Australia in 2011. On September 8, 2014 another incarnation of Duff which had only been launched in May 2014 for sale through the Woolworths chain was pulled from Australian shelves due to a complaint to Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code adjudication panel.\n\n Duff Beer is a brand of beer that originated as a fictional beverage on the animated series The Simpsons.

An authentic Cullen skink will use finnan haddie, but it may be prepared with any other undyed smoked haddock. This soup is a local speciality, from the town of Cullen in Moray, on the northeast coast of Scotland. It is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners but is also widely served as an everyday dish across the northeast of Scotland. Local recipes for Cullen skink have several slight variations, such as the use of milk instead of water or the addition of single cream. Other variations include mashing the potatoes to make the soup thicker. Cullen skink was traditionally served with bread. It has been described as \"smokier and more assertive than American chowder, heartier than classical French bisque\". Cullen skink appears in many traditional Scottish cookery books and restaurant and hotel menus throughout Scotland, the rest of the UK and abroad. In 2012 a Guardian columnist described the dish as \"the milky fish soup which has surely replaced your haggises and porridges as Scotland's signature dish\".\n\nLoch Ness Monster ; Haggis ; Bagpipes ; Snowdon Aviary \n\n Haggis is a high-level reference programming language used primarily to examine computing science for Scottish pupils taking SQA courses on the subject. Haggis is used as a tool to bridge the gap between pseudocode and typical computer programming. Haggis is not based on any one language but a mixture that is intended to allow a pupil familiar with any of the many languages used in classrooms to easily understand the syntactic construct being used in an example. It has multiple programming paradigms of functional, imperative and object-oriented to suit this purpose. There are three separate language definitions, one for each level at which computing is assessed by the SQA; these are proper subsets of each other, so for example any program contained by the National 5 level language is also well-defined at Higher and Advanced Higher levels. Higher includes the definition of procedures and functions and the use of record types and files, while Advanced Higher includes object-orientation. Online Haggis interpreters have been developed to provide a way for examiners and teachers to check their programs are correctly defined and behave as expected.\n\n Enter the Haggis is a Canadian Celtic rock band based in Toronto. The band was founded in 1995 by Craig Downie, the only remaining original member in the lineup, which currently consists of Downie (highland bagpipes, vocals), Brian Buchanan (vocals, fiddle, guitar), Trevor Lewington (vocals, guitar), Mark Abraham (bass, vocals), and Bruce McCarthy (drums). For about a year, starting in late 2014, they recorded and performed under the name Jubilee Riots, and released their eighth studio album Penny Black under that name, before returning to the original name.\n\n Wild haggis (given the humorous taxonomic designation Haggis scoticus) is a fictional creature of Scottish folklore, said to be native to the Scottish Highlands. It is comically claimed to be the source of haggis, a traditional Scottish dish that is in fact made from the innards of sheep (including heart, lungs, and liver). According to some sources, the wild haggis's left and right legs are of different lengths (cf. Sidehill gouger or Dahu), allowing it to run quickly around the steep mountains and hillsides which make up its natural habitat, but only in one direction.

Jointly with her husband, Joliot-Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for their discovery of artificial radioactivity, making them the second ever married couple (after her parents) to win the Nobel Prize, while adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date. She was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research under the Popular Front in 1936. Both children of the Joliot-Curies, Hélène and Pierre, are also prominent scientists. In 1945, she was one of the six commissioners of the new French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) created by de Gaulle and the Provisional Government of the French Republic. She died in Paris on 17 March 1956 from an acute leukemia linked to her exposure to polonium and X-rays.\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Marie and Pierre Curie, famous for their study of radioactivity, for which they won a Nobel Prize in physics with Henri Becquerel in 1903. Marie Curie is the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences; her second was awarded in chemistry in (1911) for her discoveries of radium and polonium. ; Her parents, Jean Frédéric Joliot-Curie (born Jean Frédéric Joliot) (who was mentored by Marie) and Irène Joliot-Curie (born Irène Curie), won a Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. ; Her brother Pierre Joliot is a noted biophysicist who \n\n1911: Polish-born physicist and chemist Marie Curie became the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which she received \"[for] the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\".  This made her the first person ever to win the Nobel Prize twice.  As of 2021, she is the only woman to win it twice and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. ; 1911: Norwegian biologist Kristine Bonnevie became the first woman member of the Norwegian Academy \n\n most formal scientific education, but they began to be admitted into learned societies during this period. In the later nineteenth century, the rise of the women's college provided jobs for women scientists and opportunities for education. Born in Warsaw, Poland, Marie Curie, paved the way for scientists to study radioactive decay and discovered the elements radium and polonium. Working as a physicist and chemist, she conducted pioneering research on radioactive decay and was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics and became the first person to receive a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Forty women have been awarded the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2010. Seventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine.\n\nQuestion: In which country was Marie Curie born?

For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses.\n\nThe ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. ABO blood types are also present in other primates such as apes and Old World monkeys.\n\nHistory\n\nDiscovery\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). In 1900, he found that red blood cells would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes with sera from different persons, and that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood. He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human blood into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.\n\nThis was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. In his paper, he referred to the specific blood group interactions as isoagglutination, and also introduced the concept of agglutinins (antibodies), which is the actual basis of antigen-antibody reaction in the ABO system. He asserted:\n\nThus, he discovered two antigens (agglutinogens A and B) and two antibodies (agglutinins - anti-A and anti-B). His third group (C) indicated absence of both A and B antigens, but contains anti-A and anti-B. The following year, his students Adriano Sturli and Alfred von Decastello discovered the fourth type (but not naming it, and simply referred to it as \"no particular type\").\n\nIn 1910, Ludwik Hirszfeld and Emil Freiherr von Dungern introduced the term O (null) for the group Landsteiner designated as C, and AB for the type discovered by Sturli and von Decastello. They were also the first to explain the genetic inheritance of the blood groups.\n\nClassification systems\n\nCzech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. He used the Roman numerical I, II, III, and IV (corresponding to modern O, A, B, and AB). Unknown to Janský, an American physician William L. Moss devised a slightly different classification using the same numerical; his I, II, III, and IV corresponding to modern AB, A, B, and O.\n\nThese two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. Moss's system was adopted in Britain, France, and US, while Janský's was preferred in most European countries and some parts of US. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. But it was not followed particularly where Moss's system had been used.\n\nIn 1927, Landsteiner had moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. (There was another confusion on the use of figure 0 for German null as introduced by Hirszfeld and von Dungern, because others used the letter O for ohne, meaning without or zero; Landsteiner chose the latter.) This classification was adopted by the National Research Council and became variously known as the National Research Council classification, the International classification, and most popularly the \"new\" Landsteiner classification. The new system was gradually accepted and by the early 1950s, it was universally followed.\n\nOther developments\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924. Watkins and Morgan, in England, discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type. After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.\n\nGenetics \n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The I designation stands for isoagglutinogen, another term for antigen. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. The gene is located on the long arm of the ninth chromosome (9q34).\n\nThe IA allele gives type A, IB gives type B, and i gives type O. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous (IBi,IAi). The cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.\n\nThe table above summarizes the various blood groups that children may inherit from their parents. Genotypes are shown in the second column and in small print for the offspring: AO and AA both test as type A; BO and BB test as type B. The four possibilities represent the combinations obtained when one allele is taken from each parent; each has a 25% chance, but some occur more than once. The text above them summarizes the outcomes.\n\nHistorically, ABO blood tests were used in paternity testing, but in 1957 only 50% of American men falsely accused were able to use them as evidence against paternity. Occasionally, the blood types of children are not consistent with expectations—for example, a type O child can be born to an AB parent—due to rare situations, such as Bombay phenotype and cis AB.\n\nSubgroups \nThe A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most common (over 99%). A1 makes up about 80% of all A-type blood, with A2 making up almost all of the rest. These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood.\n\nWith the development of DNA sequencing, it has been possible to identify a much larger number of alleles at the ABO locus, each of which can be categorized as A, B, or O in terms of the reaction to transfusion, but which can be distinguished by variations in the DNA sequence. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:\n\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.\n\nCis AB is another rare variant, in which A and B genes are transmitted together from a single parent.\n\nDistribution and evolutionary history \n\nThe distribution of the blood groups A, B, O and AB varies across the world according to the population. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations.\n\nIn the UK, the distribution of blood type frequencies through the population still shows some correlation to the distribution of placenames and to the successive invasions and migrations including Celts, Norsemen, Danes, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans who contributed the morphemes to the placenames and the genes to the population. The native Celts tended to have more type O blood, while the other populations tended to have more type A.\n\nThe two common O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261 nucleotides with the group A allele A01. However, unlike the group A allele, a guanosine base is subsequently deleted. A premature stop codon results from this frame-shift mutation. This variant is found worldwide, and likely predates human migration from Africa. The O01 allele is considered to predate the O02 allele.\n\nSome evolutionary biologists theorize that there are four main lineages of the ABO gene and that mutations creating type O have occurred at least three times in humans. From oldest to youngest, these lineages comprise the following alleles: A101/A201/O09, B101, O02 and O01. The continued presence of the O alleles is hypothesized to be the result of balancing selection. Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first.\n\nOrigin theories \nIt is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction. Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.\n\nHowever, it is more likely that the force driving evolution of allele diversity is simply negative frequency-dependent selection; cells with rare variants of membrane antigens are more easily distinguished by the immune system from pathogens carrying antigens from other hosts. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. The high within-population diversity observed in human populations would, then, be a consequence of natural selection on individuals.\n\nClinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells.\n\nBleeding and thrombosis (von Willebrand factor) \nThe ABO antigen is also expressed on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to human chromosome 9 band q34.2, the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.\n\nABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\nClinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.\nIn addition, another large GWAS study has associated ABO-histo blood groups as well as FUT2 secretor status with the presence in the intestinal microbiome of specific bacterial species. In this case the association was with Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium spp.  Bacteroides of the same OTU (operational taxonomic unit) have been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, thus the study suggests an important role for the ABO histo-blood group antigens as candidates for direct modulation of the human microbiome in health and disease.\n\nClinical marker \nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ABO gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).\n\nAlteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The removal of A and B antigens still does not address the problem of the Rh blood group antigen on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002.\n\nAnother approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.\n\nPseudoscience \n\nDuring the 1930s, connecting blood groups to personality types became popular in Japan and other areas of the world. Studies of this association have yet to confirm its existence definitively.\n\nOther popular but unsupported ideas include the use of a blood type diet, claims that group A causes severe hangovers, group O is associated with perfect teeth, and those with blood group A2 have the highest IQs. Scientific evidence in support of these concepts is limited at best.\n\nSee also \n Secretor status – secretion of ABO antigens in body fluids\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n ABO at BGMUT Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database at NCBI, NIH\n Encyclopædia Britannica, ABO blood group system\n National Blood Transfusion Service\n Molecular Genetic Basis of ABO\n\nBlood antigen systems\nTransfusion medicine\nAntigenic determinant\nHematopathology\nGlycoproteins\nSerology\nGenes on human chromosome 9\n\nThe ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes.

Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction. Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.\n\nHowever, it is more likely that the force driving evolution of allele diversity is simply negative frequency-dependent selection; cells with rare variants of membrane antigens are more easily distinguished by the immune system from pathogens carrying antigens from other hosts. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. The high within-population diversity observed in human populations would, then, be a consequence of natural selection on individuals.\n\nClinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells.\n\nBleeding and thrombosis (von Willebrand factor) \nThe ABO antigen is also expressed on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to human chromosome 9 band q34.2, the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.\n\nABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\nClinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.\nIn addition, another large GWAS study has associated ABO-histo blood groups as well as FUT2 secretor status with the presence in the intestinal microbiome of specific bacterial species. In this case the association was with Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium spp.  Bacteroides of the same OTU (operational taxonomic unit) have been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, thus the study suggests an important role for the ABO histo-blood group antigens as candidates for direct modulation of the human microbiome in health and disease.\n\nClinical marker \nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ABO gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).\n\nAlteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The removal of A and B antigens still does not address the problem of the Rh blood group antigen on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002.\n\nAnother approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.\n\nPseudoscience \n\nDuring the 1930s, connecting blood groups to personality types became popular in Japan and other areas of the world. Studies of this association have yet to confirm its existence definitively.\n\nOther popular but unsupported ideas include the use of a blood type diet, claims that group A causes severe hangovers, group O is associated with perfect teeth, and those with blood group A2 have the highest IQs. Scientific evidence in support of these concepts is limited at best.\n\nSee also \n Secretor status – secretion of ABO antigens in body fluids\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n ABO at BGMUT Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database at NCBI, NIH\n Encyclopædia Britannica, ABO blood group system\n National Blood Transfusion Service\n Molecular Genetic Basis of ABO\n\nBlood antigen systems\nTransfusion medicine\nAntigenic determinant\nHematopathology\nGlycoproteins\nSerology\nGenes on human chromosome 9\n\nThe ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses.\n\nThe ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. ABO blood types are also present in other primates such as apes and Old World monkeys.\n\nHistory\n\nDiscovery\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). In 1900, he found that red blood cells would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes with sera from different persons, and that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood. He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human blood into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.\n\nThis was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. In his paper, he referred to the specific blood group interactions as isoagglutination, and also introduced the concept of agglutinins (antibodies), which is the actual basis of antigen-antibody reaction in the ABO system. He asserted:\n\nThus, he discovered two antigens (agglutinogens A and B) and two antibodies (agglutinins - anti-A and anti-B). His third group (C) indicated absence of both A and B antigens, but contains anti-A and anti-B. The following year, his students Adriano Sturli and Alfred von Decastello discovered the fourth type (but not naming it, and simply referred to it as \"no particular type\").\n\nIn 1910, Ludwik Hirszfeld and Emil Freiherr von Dungern introduced the term O (null) for the group Landsteiner designated as C, and AB for the type discovered by Sturli and von Decastello. They were also the first to explain the genetic inheritance of the blood groups.\n\nClassification systems\n\nCzech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. He used the Roman numerical I, II, III, and IV (corresponding to modern O, A, B, and AB). Unknown to Janský, an American physician William L. Moss devised a slightly different classification using the same numerical; his I, II, III, and IV corresponding to modern AB, A, B, and O.\n\nThese two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. Moss's system was adopted in Britain, France, and US, while Janský's was preferred in most European countries and some parts of US. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. But it was not followed particularly where Moss's system had been used.\n\nIn 1927, Landsteiner had moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. (There was another confusion on the use of figure 0 for German null as introduced by Hirszfeld and von Dungern, because others used the letter O for ohne, meaning without or zero; Landsteiner chose the latter.) This classification was adopted by the National Research Council and became variously known as the National Research Council classification, the International classification, and most popularly the \"new\" Landsteiner classification. The new system was gradually accepted and by the early 1950s, it was universally followed.\n\nOther developments\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924. Watkins and Morgan, in England, discovered that the ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type. After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.\n\nGenetics \n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The I designation stands for isoagglutinogen, another term for antigen. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. The gene is located on the long arm of the ninth chromosome (9q34).\n\nThe IA allele gives type A, IB gives type B, and i gives type O. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous (IBi,IAi). The cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.\n\nThe table above summarizes the various blood groups that children may inherit from their parents. Genotypes are shown in the second column and in small print for the offspring: AO and AA both test as type A; BO and BB test as type B. The four possibilities represent the combinations obtained when one allele is taken from each parent; each has a 25% chance, but some occur more than once. The text above them summarizes the outcomes.\n\nHistorically, ABO blood tests were used in paternity testing, but in 1957 only 50% of American men falsely accused were able to use them as evidence against paternity. Occasionally, the blood types of children are not consistent with expectations—for example, a type O child can be born to an AB parent—due to rare situations, such as Bombay phenotype and cis AB.\n\nSubgroups \nThe A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most common (over 99%). A1 makes up about 80% of all A-type blood, with A2 making up almost all of the rest. These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood.\n\nWith the development of DNA sequencing, it has been possible to identify a much larger number of alleles at the ABO locus, each of which can be categorized as A, B, or O in terms of the reaction to transfusion, but which can be distinguished by variations in the DNA sequence. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:\n\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.\n\nCis AB is another rare variant, in which A and B genes are transmitted together from a single parent.\n\nDistribution and evolutionary history \n\nThe distribution of the blood groups A, B, O and AB varies across the world according to the population. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations.\n\nIn the UK, the distribution of blood type frequencies through the population still shows some correlation to the distribution of placenames and to the successive invasions and migrations including Celts, Norsemen, Danes, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans who contributed the morphemes to the placenames and the genes to the population. The native Celts tended to have more type O blood, while the other populations tended to have more type A.\n\nThe two common O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261 nucleotides with the group A allele A01. However, unlike the group A allele, a guanosine base is subsequently deleted. A premature stop codon results from this frame-shift mutation. This variant is found worldwide, and likely predates human migration from Africa. The O01 allele is considered to predate the O02 allele.\n\nSome evolutionary biologists theorize that there are four main lineages of the ABO gene and that mutations creating type O have occurred at least three times in humans. From oldest to youngest, these lineages comprise the following alleles: A101/A201/O09, B101, O02 and O01. The continued presence of the O alleles is hypothesized to be the result of balancing selection. Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first.\n\nOrigin theories \nIt is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction.

Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.\n\nHowever, it is more likely that the force driving evolution of allele diversity is simply negative frequency-dependent selection; cells with rare variants of membrane antigens are more easily distinguished by the immune system from pathogens carrying antigens from other hosts. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. The high within-population diversity observed in human populations would, then, be a consequence of natural selection on individuals.\n\nClinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells.\n\nBleeding and thrombosis (von Willebrand factor) \nThe ABO antigen is also expressed on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to human chromosome 9 band q34.2, the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.\n\nABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\nClinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.\nIn addition, another large GWAS study has associated ABO-histo blood groups as well as FUT2 secretor status with the presence in the intestinal microbiome of specific bacterial species. In this case the association was with Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium spp.  Bacteroides of the same OTU (operational taxonomic unit) have been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, thus the study suggests an important role for the ABO histo-blood group antigens as candidates for direct modulation of the human microbiome in health and disease.\n\nClinical marker \nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ABO gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).\n\nAlteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The removal of A and B antigens still does not address the problem of the Rh blood group antigen on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002.\n\nAnother approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.\n\nPseudoscience \n\nDuring the 1930s, connecting blood groups to personality types became popular in Japan and other areas of the world. Studies of this association have yet to confirm its existence definitively.\n\nOther popular but unsupported ideas include the use of a blood type diet, claims that group A causes severe hangovers, group O is associated with perfect teeth, and those with blood group A2 have the highest IQs. Scientific evidence in support of these concepts is limited at best.\n\nSee also \n Secretor status – secretion of ABO antigens in body fluids\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n ABO at BGMUT Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database at NCBI, NIH\n Encyclopædia Britannica, ABO blood group system\n National Blood Transfusion Service\n Molecular Genetic Basis of ABO\n\nBlood antigen systems\nTransfusion medicine\nAntigenic determinant\nHematopathology\nGlycoproteins\nSerology\nGenes on human chromosome 9\n\nYou thought knowing your blood type was something people do for fun. It may actually be a window into your health. From heart disease and strokes to certain types of cancer, here’s why your blood type matters.\nUnless you’ve recently given blood, you may not think much about your blood type. The presence or absence of certain molecules called A or B antigens, as well as a protein called the Rh factor, determine which of the eight common blood types you have coursing through your veins. (Groups: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+ or O-.) However, these antigens make a difference beyond just your blood, influencing other body systems like your blood vessels, nerve cells, and blood platelets—which is why your blood type may impact your risk of certain diseases. Here’s why you should know what blood type you have.\nNon-O blood types have 25 to 30 percent higher levels of blood clotting proteins known as von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. In part, because of that difference, these folks also have a 15 percent greater risk of dying from heart disease, reports 2015 research from BMC Medicine. Learn about the 9 things you need to know about heart attacks.\nConsidering that type Os have lower quantities of the proteins that help blood coagulate, they’re also less likely to suffer from blood clots. (The downside is that blood clotting helps prevent excessive bleeding.) That said, there are many things that cause blood clots. “It shouldn’t be assumed that being an O blood type means an individual is ‘protected’ or an A blood type is at higher risk,” says American Society of Hematology Councillor Terry B. Gernsheimer, MD. Here are the blood clot symptoms you should definitely not ignore.\nO may be the most common blood type, but it can interfere with pregnancy. As research from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine notes, O’s were twice as likely to have levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)—levels that were high enough to indicate low ovarian reserve.\nAnother interesting finding from the BMC Medicine study: Non-O blood types (A, B, or AB) also had an increased risk of gastric cancers, possibly due to an inflammatory response to H. pylori bacteria, the researchers write. (The bacteria is a cause of gastric ulcers.) Here’s how to know if your pain is from an ulcer.\nBecause of differences in clotting, A/B blood types are 31 percent more likely to suffer from venous thromboembolism—a clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin, or arm—compared to the O type, according to research from the University of Minnesota. Learn how to prevent deep vein thrombosis while on an airplane.\nThough AB is the least common blood type, research suggests that people with AB are 82 percent more likely to develop cognitive issues in the future. It may be because this blood type comes along with higher levels of factor VIII, the study authors say.\nPeople with A or B blood type have up to 21 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, per Diabetologia. (B positive had the highest odds.) While researchers note that it’s not exactly known why, one thought is that it may be that blood type influences the GI microbiome, which can affect glucose metabolism and inflammation.\nYou may have heard people talk about a trendy diet: that eating and avoiding certain foods based on your blood type can boost your health and lower your risk of disease. However, a 2013 review in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that there’s no evidence that proves these types of diets actually work. Another study found that although following the diet may work, it has nothing to do with someone’s specific blood type. Find out more about blood type diets.\nThere’s a theory that your blood type can explain why you act the way you do. While that largely hasn’t been proven, one Japanese study found that some traits differed between blood groups. People with type A, for instance, scored higher on persistence compared to type B or O. Even the researchers note that there’s not enough data to prove the connection, however. Until we know more, looks like your blood type can’t be the scapegoat for your behavior.\nKeep in mind that the research linking blood type and health conditions looks at population studies, so it can only find an association—not that your blood type is the cause. “The risk for any one person is multifactorial,” notes Dr. Gernsheimer. That means your daily habits—what you eat, your activity level, how you handle stress, your family history—make a huge difference in your individual risk.\nYour blood type certainly doesn’t seal your fate when it comes to your health. “It’s important to understand that blood groups also vary in different ethnicities and within ethnic groups depending on where they settled during migrations. These differences in cultures may lead to differences in diet and lifestyle that further affect risk,” says Dr. Gernsheimer.\nEven though there are many ways your blood type can influence your health, “there isn’t good evidence that one’s lifestyle should be altered because of it,” says Dr. Gernsheimer. And it’s not up to you to have this info should you need a blood transfusion, she says. Healthcare personnel wouldn’t rely on your word for it—they’d check it in advance. All that to say: don’t get down if you’re not in the know. Next, learn obscure facts about your own body you never knew.\n\nQuestion: What is the most common blood type in humans?

Essays about them date back to at least 1927. They are a thin shaft of twisted tissue paper about 20 centimeters long with one end containing a few grains of a black gunpowder. The black powder composition consists of three basic chemicals: potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal. The pointed end is lit and held straight down, so that the flame is at the bottom. After a few seconds a glowing, molten slag will form. This is reportedly potassium sulfide, which contains carbon from the charcoal. The molten ball will ignite the second phase of the senko hanabi, silently spraying an array of delicate branching \n\n In Canada, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of Natural Resources Canada. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience. Certification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display fireworks, and different government training and certification must be obtained. The available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories.\n\n In Australia, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process. There is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require.\n\n Fireworks are a class of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic and entertainment purposes. The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke, as well as floating materials (confetti most notably). They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and silver. Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.

Rookwood was born into a wealthy family of Catholic recusants, and educated by Jesuits in Flanders. His older brother became a Franciscan, and his two younger brothers were ordained as Catholic priests. Rookwood became a horse-breeder. He married the Catholic Elizabeth Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons. He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by Robert Catesby, a religious zealot whose impatience with James' treatment of English Catholics had grown so \n\n admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought, but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder, they found that it had decayed (separated). Thus, more gunpowder was brought in. Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. The latter's involvement in the plot has long been the subject of controversy, as on 26 October his brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, received an anonymous letter while at home, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Thomas went with \n\n The existence of the plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered ten days earlier to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to keep away from Parliament. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. He was immediately arrested. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting Christopher Wright \n\n  Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Night and Firework Night, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in the United Kingdom. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at \n\n Guy Fawkes (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who was involved in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met Thomas Wintour, with whom he returned to England. Wintour introduced him to Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate King James I and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. \n\nQuestion: Which King did Guy Fawkes attempt to kill with his gunpowder plot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were the stars of Holiday Inn with support from Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale. Filming took place between November 18, 1941, and January 30, 1942. Produced and directed by Mark Sandrich, Holiday Inn had its premiere at the New York City Paramount Theatre August 4, 1942. It was a success in the US and the UK, the highest-grossing film musical to that time. It was expected that \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\" would be the big song. While that song did very well, it was \"White Christmas\" that topped the charts in October 1942 and stayed there for eleven weeks. Another Berlin song, \"Happy Holiday\", is featured over the opening credits and \n\n 16) White Christmas (second version) [with Marjorie Reynolds] ; 17) Ending Medley (with Fred Astaire, Marjorie Reynolds & Virginia Dale) ; 18) Holiday Inn movie trailer (audio only - bonus track) It was not until 1979, 37 years after the making of the film, that a full soundtrack was released on Sunbeam Records (STK-112) of the songs in the movie. In 2004, the Soundtrack Factory label released a soundtrack of the original recordings taken directly from the movie.

With music by Irving Berlin, the composer wrote twelve songs specifically for the film, the best known being \"White Christmas\". The film features a complete reuse of the song \"Easter Parade\", written by Berlin for the 1933 Broadway revue As Thousands Cheer. The film's choreography was by Danny Dare. The film received a 1943 Academy Award for Best Original Song (Irving Berlin for \"White Christmas\"), as well as Academy Award nominations for Best Score (Robert Emmett Dolan) and Best Original Story (Irving Berlin).\n\nQuestion: In which film was the song White Christmas first sung?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was written by J. R. Rotem and Andrea Martin, and was produced by Rotem. It is featured on Lewis's debut album Spirit (2007). \"Better in Time\" was released on 10 March 2008 as Lewis's third single in the United Kingdom, as a double A-side with \"Footprints in the Sand\", and \"You Bring Me Down\" as B-side. It was Lewis's second international single following her hit \"Bleeding Love\" (2007). Lyrically, \"Better in Time\" tells the story of a girl who cannot forget her ex-partner, and who knows that \"it will all get better in time\". Lewis promoted the song on several live television programmes, such as Good Morning America, Live with Regis and \n\n The song was acclaimed by critics upon release. Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, noting its strength as a pop-rock anthem. Jemma Volp-Fletcher gave the single a perfect score of 10 out of 10, calling it \"staggering\", while also complimenting frontman Flowers' songwriting skills. musicOMH's Sara McDonnell was also impressed, saying that it had \"classic song' written all over it\". In 2009, The Daily Telegraph listed it among the \"100 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In December 2005, the song was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Grammy Awards, but lost to \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\" by U2.\n\n Birkett began attending stage school when she was just three years old. She had had hopes of being a performer and had previously auditioned unsuccessfully to be in S Club 7, finishing in the final 12. She trained at the Amanda McGlynn Academy in Middlesbrough and the Lorraine Murray Dance School. In 2002, Birkett finished fourth on the first series of Pop Idol, behind Will Young, Gareth Gates and Darius Danesh, and being the highest placed female on the show. During the programme, she performed such songs as Whitney Houston's \"One Moment in Time\", \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\"; Aretha Franklin's \"I Say a Little Prayer\"; ABBA's \"Thank You For the Music\" and Judy Garland's \"Get Happy\". After the show, Birkett was the warm-up act on Pop Idol winners Will Young's and Gareth Gates' tour where she performed in front of 18,000 people. She performed three songs for Pop Idol: The Big Band Album.\n\n to be commercially more successful than Hear'Say, achieving ten consecutive UK top 20 singles before their split in 2007. Darius Danesh was another noted auditionee in the first series of Popstars. Danesh was seen as an early favourite on the show, but was eliminated halfway through the series after performing an 'alternative' version of Britney Spears's \"...Baby One More Time\" to the judges. Danesh went on to compete in the first series of Pop Idol, finishing third. He then had a successful solo career as a recording artist before becoming a West End theatre performer. Contestant Warren Stacey was signed to Def Jam Recordings in 2001 and reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart with his debut hit \"My Girl, My Girl\".\n\n Hitting the top was Darius Danesh, third in Pop Idol. \"Colourblind\" spent two weeks at the top, but despite being less successful than the debuts of Gareth or Will, Darius wrote the song himself. The Sugababes hit the top for a second time with their sixth single, \"Round Round\". Like their first No. 1 single, it only spent a week at the summit. The song was taken from the soundtrack to the hit film, \"The Guru\". Specialising in Pop/R'N'B with garage influences, all-male act, Blazin' Squad entered at the top of the charts with their massively hyped debut single, \"Crossroads\".

Varacalli was the alleged ring leader of the biggest stolen car empire in New York City. New York Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said that Varacalli made more than $10.5 million a year stealing cars to order and dispatching thieves to steal air bags from specific cars, based on orders from auto parts shops around the city. Some of those cars were \"stolen\" with the consent of their owners who wanted to get out of lease payments. Varacalli's crew was responsible for the theft of about 600 auto airbags. In 2002, Varacalli was sentenced to 10 years in prison and received a $1 million fine. He was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Otisville, New York. On December 21, 2009 Varacalli was released from prison.\n\nDonald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 – April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber and spree killer who was convicted of the January 25, 1980 murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon. He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. His execution was particularly noteworthy and controversial due to the fact that his death in the gas chamber took eleven minutes and was reportedly gruesome. Harding's execution ultimately provided momentum for the movement to provide Arizona death row inmates with a choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection.\n\nEarly life \nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. By the time a physician arrived to assist with the birth, Harding was struggling for air; this resulted in Harding incurring organic brain syndrome. He also suffered from neonatal jaundice. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding was a toddler, he was admitted to the Child Guidance Clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas, where a doctor treating him wrote in a report that his mother was \"very immature and narcissistic\" and unfit to care for her sons. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed.\n\nThe family stayed at the sanatorium for approximately 2 years before leaving, after which Harding moved repeatedly between living with his mother and his grandparents. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. Harding witnessed Brown beating his mother; while he was in school, he struggled with behavioral issues, including defiance and truancy. A doctor reported in February 1960, shortly before Harding turned 11, that Harding displayed suicidal tendencies when he was 9 years old, slashing his wrists and leaving a note in which he threatened to \"jump in a river.\" That same doctor noted that while Harding's brother Darryl displayed none of the problematic behaviors that Harding did, Donald Harding had \"expressed the desire to kill and choke people. . . . It is amazing the degree of psychopathy contained in a boy of this young age.\" The doctor attributed Harding's behavioral issues to his brain damage, which his mother also claimed was exacerbated by Harding falling from a crib and being struck by a swingset during his childhood. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. The tests confirmed that Harding suffered from organic brain damage and epileptic seizures.\n\nPre-Arizona criminal history \nHarding's first arrest occurred when he was 11 years old, when he was arrested for joyriding. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. These convictions resulted in Harding being placed in an adult maximum security prison, the Tucker Unit, where, in 1970, he was also convicted for attempting to escape from custody. During Harding's stay on death row, his attorneys would attribute further behavioral and developmental issues to Harding's time in prison as a teenager. While in the prison, Harding attempted suicide again. \n\nHarding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder.\n\nHarding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension. Harding's crime spree began with the attempted robbery of a prostitute in Chicago, Illinois, on September 27; on December 10, he robbed and murdered Stanton Winston Blanton in Dallas, Texas, although he was never charged with this murder. On December 18, he robbed a man named Ronald Svetgoff and stole his car and identification cards, the latter of which he would use to feign his identity when he relocated to Arizona. Meanwhile, Harding took multiple individuals and families hostage throughout Texas, Utah, and California throughout the rest of December 1979.\n\nOn January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. Harding remained in California, robbing and carjacking multiple individuals and couples. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. Huth's murder was not immediately discovered, and weeks following the murder, authorities still had not found a body. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Later, while still in San Diego, Harding robbed four people in an optometrist's office and ordered one of the robbery victims to drive him to an unknown woman's house.\n\nArizona murders \nOn January 24, 1980, Harding fled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he gained entry to a hotel room belonging to 38-year-old gastroenterologist Allen F. Gage. Harding bound Gage's wrists and ankles and gagged him with a sock before robbing him. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth.\n\nOn January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. The next morning, police in Tucson discovered the bodies. Wise's body was on the floor next to the bed, tied to the bedpost by a restraint wrapped around his neck with his hands and ankles bound together. He had missing teeth and jaw fractures from when Harding had bludgeoned him with the lamp, and Harding had shot him point-blank with a .25 caliber pistol once in the chest and once in the left temple. Medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the fact that the first bullet had perforated his spinal cord. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him.\n\nAfter going through Robert Wise's belongings, Harding found the victim's home address. He drove the stolen car to Wise's home, where he encountered Wise's wife, supposedly with the intention of murdering her and Wise's children. Wise, Wise's family, Concannon, and Gage were all complete strangers to Harding. Harding had one of Wise's business cards and pretended to know Wise, and after he identified himself under false pretenses, he asked her if \"Bob Wise\" was home. Wise's wife told Harding that he was not, but that she was expecting him to be home shortly and that he was late. Later, during Harding's trial for Wise's murder, his wife testified that she believed Harding may have left her home so quickly because he was afraid of their family dog.\n\nApprehension \nAfter this encounter, Harding drove the stolen car to a reserved parking lot on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The campus policeman who was monitoring the lot told Harding to park elsewhere; when he and Harding spoke, he noticed that he had a southern accent in spite of the fact that his car had Ohio license plates. The policeman called his police dispatcher and asked him to check the license number. While Harding drove away from the parking lot, the dispatcher returned with information about the car having been stolen and possibly involved in two homicides. The campus police officer then followed Harding, arrested him, and searched him, finding a .25 caliber pistol in one of his pockets, an identification card reading \"Security Guard,\" another identification card reading \"Special Officer,\" a Texas driver's license issued to a man named Ronald Gene Svetgoff, and an Oklahoma driver's license issued to the same man. Harding claimed that he was Svetgoff, but police took him into custody anyway, where they eventually discovered his real identity.\n\nAt the time of his capture, the FBI office in Flagstaff announced that Harding was wanted for investigation in connection with a total of five murders, six kidnappings, 12 armed robberies, and four carjackings across Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Tennessee, and Texas. By the time he was convicted of the murders that would result in him receiving the death penalty, Harding would be a prime suspect in a total of over 40 armed robberies and kidnappings, as well as 7 murders. Harding was subsequently charged with the murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, and he was booked into the jail in Coconino County, Arizona. When asked why he murdered some of his victims and not others, Harding replied, \"Judgment calls.\"\n\nTrial \nWhile Harding awaited his trial for the two murders, he remained in custody. In October 1980, Harding assaulted a fellow jail inmate, leading to him being charged with Dangerous or Deadly Assault by Prisoner. Harding chose to serve as his own counsel in this trial; a court also appointed a public defender to help Harding. Prior to the assault trial beginning, Harding threatened to harm his public defender and issued general threats towards other participants in the trial. Due to these threats, Harding was required to be restrained in leg irons during his trial. He was convicted of the assault on July 30, 1981, after which he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Sometime later, Harding was transferred to the Pima County Jail, where, in February, he attacked two guards. He attempted to stab one guard, while the other prevented him from doing so.\n\nHarding's trial for the murders began on April 21, 1982. During Harding’s trial, deputy sheriffs cordoned off the first two rows of the courtroom’s viewing gallery to prevent Harding from being able to take a hostage. One deputy reported that Harding had told him that he was going to do something to prompt police to shoot him because he did not want to go to prison again. His defense attorney used the evidence of Harding's organic brain damage to build an argument that Harding could not prevent himself from acting on his \"violent impulses\" and was therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. Prosecutors countered by arguing that Harding's crimes were well planned and not impulsive. Although Harding primarily acted as his own attorney during his murder trial as well, with some assistance from a court-appointed public defender, he spent most of the trial seated with his eyes concealed by sunglasses, refusing to cross-examine witnesses or present a defense. After the prosecution and defense rested their cases, the jury deliberated for five hours before returning with their verdict on April 27, at 4:15 PM. Harding was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, as well as the armed robberies and kidnappings of both men and the theft of Concannon’s car.\n\nOn May 26, 1982, Harding's sentencing hearing took place. The trial court permitted Harding to present mitigating circumstances to argue against the imposition of the death penalty in his case and also offered him additional time to form his case, but Harding declined both the offer to present mitigating circumstances and the offer for extra time. The prosecution found four aggravating circumstances, including his prior conviction for the life-threatening assault that he had committed while in custody; the fact that he committed the murders for pecuniary gain; and the fact that the murders were committed in \"an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\" Harding was formally sentenced to death for the two murders; he also received two consecutive 21-year sentences for the robberies and two more consecutive 5-year sentences for the theft of Concannon's car. Later, Harding received a third death sentence for the murder of Allen Gage, although this third sentence was imposed separately from the murders for Concannon and Wise; Harding was ultimately executed after exhausting his appeals for the double murder.\n\nExecution \nHarding remained on death row in Arizona for almost ten years. During that time, he filed a total of three appeals, all of which saw his murder convictions and death sentences upheld.\n\nAt Harding's hearing before the Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles, his defense attorneys repeated the arguments they used in Harding's trial regarding his organic brain damage. The board ultimately refused to recommend that then-Governor Fife Symington grant mercy in the form of a reprieve or commutation to life imprisonment.\n\nPrior to the execution, around 150 people staged an anti-death penalty protest outside of the prison walls. Harding's execution was scheduled to take place shortly after midnight on April 6, 1992. Martin Concannon's widow elected not to view the execution, but Warden Roger Crist, then-Attorney General Grant Woods, Harding's religious advisor, and six reporters were witnesses. Harding ate a last meal consisting of fried eggs, several strips of bacon, toast (with butter and honey), and orange juice.\n\nAt approximately 12:05 AM, Harding was led into the gas chamber. When the chamber was sealed, a curtain was lifted to allow witnesses to look at Harding; Attorney General Woods claimed that Harding then looked at him and began yelling obscenities through the glass. Reporters claimed that Harding also made obscene gestures with his middle finger towards Attorney General Woods as the gas spread in the chamber. \n\nHarding's attorney described the execution as \"slow, painful, degrading, and inhumane,\" claiming that Harding convulsed violently and repeatedly gasped for breath while his body shuddered with spasms for several minutes until he went still. Ultimately, Harding was pronounced dead 10 minutes and 31 seconds after the gas was released into the chamber. Harding was the first person executed in Arizona after the death penalty moratorium imposed by the 1972 Furman v. Georgia ruling was lifted, and he was the first in the state since the 1963 gas chamber execution of Manuel Silvas.\n\nAftermath \nHarding's execution generated controversy over the nature and duration of his death; likewise, it provided momentum to replace the gas chamber with lethal injection. State Representative Lela Steffey had proposed the change from the gas chamber earlier in 1992 due to concerns about air pollution involved in venting lethal gas after an execution, and Steffey stated that polls showed that a majority of Arizonans supported the switch to lethal injection; however, the movement did not gain momentum until after Harding's execution. Further propelling this move to change execution methods was the equally controversial and lengthy gas chamber execution of Robert Alton Harris in California on April 21, 1992. On April 25, the Arizona State House of Representatives passed a bill 41-7 to allow Arizona's death row inmates at the time to choose between the gas chamber and lethal injection; all death row inmates sentenced subsequent to the law change would not have the option to choose the gas chamber. \n\nDuring the 1992 election, a referendum allowed Arizonans to vote on whether or not the state should adopt lethal injection; voters approved the change in execution method. Prisoners sentenced to death in Arizona prior to November 15, 1992 still had the option to choose the gas chamber. Harding was the last prisoner executed in Arizona's gas chamber without having lethal injection as an option, although he was not the last person to die in Arizona's gas chamber overall; in 1999, Walter LaGrand, who was sentenced to death in 1982, requested the gas chamber as his method of execution. To date, he is the most recent person to be executed by cyanide gas in a gas chamber in the United States.\n\nCoverage of Harding's execution and its aftermath stated that the warden threatened to quit if he were required to perform another gas chamber execution. The New York Times and Newsweek claimed Attorney General Woods became ill and vomited at the sight of Harding's convulsions. Woods later disputed those claims and stated that while he found that the execution left a lasting impression with him and was disturbing, he still supported the death penalty in Harding's case and did not become ill at Harding's execution.\n\nSee also \n\n Capital punishment in Arizona\n Capital punishment in the United States\n List of people executed in Arizona\n\nReferences \n\n1949 births\n1992 deaths\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican spree killers\nPeople executed for murder\nExecuted American people\nExecuted spree killers\n20th-century executions by Arizona\n20th-century executions of American people\nPeople convicted of murder by Arizona\nPeople executed by gas chamber\n\nDonald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 – April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber and spree killer who was convicted of the January 25, 1980 murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon.

While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Later, while still in San Diego, Harding robbed four people in an optometrist's office and ordered one of the robbery victims to drive him to an unknown woman's house.\n\nArizona murders \nOn January 24, 1980, Harding fled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he gained entry to a hotel room belonging to 38-year-old gastroenterologist Allen F. Gage. Harding bound Gage's wrists and ankles and gagged him with a sock before robbing him. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth.\n\nOn January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. The next morning, police in Tucson discovered the bodies. Wise's body was on the floor next to the bed, tied to the bedpost by a restraint wrapped around his neck with his hands and ankles bound together. He had missing teeth and jaw fractures from when Harding had bludgeoned him with the lamp, and Harding had shot him point-blank with a .25 caliber pistol once in the chest and once in the left temple. Medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the fact that the first bullet had perforated his spinal cord. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him.\n\nAfter going through Robert Wise's belongings, Harding found the victim's home address. He drove the stolen car to Wise's home, where he encountered Wise's wife, supposedly with the intention of murdering her and Wise's children. Wise, Wise's family, Concannon, and Gage were all complete strangers to Harding. Harding had one of Wise's business cards and pretended to know Wise, and after he identified himself under false pretenses, he asked her if \"Bob Wise\" was home. Wise's wife told Harding that he was not, but that she was expecting him to be home shortly and that he was late. Later, during Harding's trial for Wise's murder, his wife testified that she believed Harding may have left her home so quickly because he was afraid of their family dog.\n\nApprehension \nAfter this encounter, Harding drove the stolen car to a reserved parking lot on the campus of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The campus policeman who was monitoring the lot told Harding to park elsewhere; when he and Harding spoke, he noticed that he had a southern accent in spite of the fact that his car had Ohio license plates. The policeman called his police dispatcher and asked him to check the license number. While Harding drove away from the parking lot, the dispatcher returned with information about the car having been stolen and possibly involved in two homicides. The campus police officer then followed Harding, arrested him, and searched him, finding a .25 caliber pistol in one of his pockets, an identification card reading \"Security Guard,\" another identification card reading \"Special Officer,\" a Texas driver's license issued to a man named Ronald Gene Svetgoff, and an Oklahoma driver's license issued to the same man. Harding claimed that he was Svetgoff, but police took him into custody anyway, where they eventually discovered his real identity.\n\nAt the time of his capture, the FBI office in Flagstaff announced that Harding was wanted for investigation in connection with a total of five murders, six kidnappings, 12 armed robberies, and four carjackings across Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Tennessee, and Texas. By the time he was convicted of the murders that would result in him receiving the death penalty, Harding would be a prime suspect in a total of over 40 armed robberies and kidnappings, as well as 7 murders. Harding was subsequently charged with the murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, and he was booked into the jail in Coconino County, Arizona. When asked why he murdered some of his victims and not others, Harding replied, \"Judgment calls.\"\n\nTrial \nWhile Harding awaited his trial for the two murders, he remained in custody. In October 1980, Harding assaulted a fellow jail inmate, leading to him being charged with Dangerous or Deadly Assault by Prisoner. Harding chose to serve as his own counsel in this trial; a court also appointed a public defender to help Harding. Prior to the assault trial beginning, Harding threatened to harm his public defender and issued general threats towards other participants in the trial. Due to these threats, Harding was required to be restrained in leg irons during his trial. He was convicted of the assault on July 30, 1981, after which he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Sometime later, Harding was transferred to the Pima County Jail, where, in February, he attacked two guards. He attempted to stab one guard, while the other prevented him from doing so.\n\nHarding's trial for the murders began on April 21, 1982. During Harding’s trial, deputy sheriffs cordoned off the first two rows of the courtroom’s viewing gallery to prevent Harding from being able to take a hostage. One deputy reported that Harding had told him that he was going to do something to prompt police to shoot him because he did not want to go to prison again. His defense attorney used the evidence of Harding's organic brain damage to build an argument that Harding could not prevent himself from acting on his \"violent impulses\" and was therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. Prosecutors countered by arguing that Harding's crimes were well planned and not impulsive. Although Harding primarily acted as his own attorney during his murder trial as well, with some assistance from a court-appointed public defender, he spent most of the trial seated with his eyes concealed by sunglasses, refusing to cross-examine witnesses or present a defense. After the prosecution and defense rested their cases, the jury deliberated for five hours before returning with their verdict on April 27, at 4:15 PM. Harding was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, as well as the armed robberies and kidnappings of both men and the theft of Concannon’s car.\n\nOn May 26, 1982, Harding's sentencing hearing took place. The trial court permitted Harding to present mitigating circumstances to argue against the imposition of the death penalty in his case and also offered him additional time to form his case, but Harding declined both the offer to present mitigating circumstances and the offer for extra time. The prosecution found four aggravating circumstances, including his prior conviction for the life-threatening assault that he had committed while in custody; the fact that he committed the murders for pecuniary gain; and the fact that the murders were committed in \"an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\" Harding was formally sentenced to death for the two murders; he also received two consecutive 21-year sentences for the robberies and two more consecutive 5-year sentences for the theft of Concannon's car. Later, Harding received a third death sentence for the murder of Allen Gage, although this third sentence was imposed separately from the murders for Concannon and Wise; Harding was ultimately executed after exhausting his appeals for the double murder.\n\nExecution \nHarding remained on death row in Arizona for almost ten years. During that time, he filed a total of three appeals, all of which saw his murder convictions and death sentences upheld.\n\nAt Harding's hearing before the Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles, his defense attorneys repeated the arguments they used in Harding's trial regarding his organic brain damage. The board ultimately refused to recommend that then-Governor Fife Symington grant mercy in the form of a reprieve or commutation to life imprisonment.\n\nPrior to the execution, around 150 people staged an anti-death penalty protest outside of the prison walls. Harding's execution was scheduled to take place shortly after midnight on April 6, 1992. Martin Concannon's widow elected not to view the execution, but Warden Roger Crist, then-Attorney General Grant Woods, Harding's religious advisor, and six reporters were witnesses. Harding ate a last meal consisting of fried eggs, several strips of bacon, toast (with butter and honey), and orange juice.\n\nAt approximately 12:05 AM, Harding was led into the gas chamber. When the chamber was sealed, a curtain was lifted to allow witnesses to look at Harding; Attorney General Woods claimed that Harding then looked at him and began yelling obscenities through the glass. Reporters claimed that Harding also made obscene gestures with his middle finger towards Attorney General Woods as the gas spread in the chamber. \n\nHarding's attorney described the execution as \"slow, painful, degrading, and inhumane,\" claiming that Harding convulsed violently and repeatedly gasped for breath while his body shuddered with spasms for several minutes until he went still. Ultimately, Harding was pronounced dead 10 minutes and 31 seconds after the gas was released into the chamber. Harding was the first person executed in Arizona after the death penalty moratorium imposed by the 1972 Furman v. Georgia ruling was lifted, and he was the first in the state since the 1963 gas chamber execution of Manuel Silvas.\n\nAftermath \nHarding's execution generated controversy over the nature and duration of his death; likewise, it provided momentum to replace the gas chamber with lethal injection. State Representative Lela Steffey had proposed the change from the gas chamber earlier in 1992 due to concerns about air pollution involved in venting lethal gas after an execution, and Steffey stated that polls showed that a majority of Arizonans supported the switch to lethal injection; however, the movement did not gain momentum until after Harding's execution. Further propelling this move to change execution methods was the equally controversial and lengthy gas chamber execution of Robert Alton Harris in California on April 21, 1992. On April 25, the Arizona State House of Representatives passed a bill 41-7 to allow Arizona's death row inmates at the time to choose between the gas chamber and lethal injection; all death row inmates sentenced subsequent to the law change would not have the option to choose the gas chamber. \n\nDuring the 1992 election, a referendum allowed Arizonans to vote on whether or not the state should adopt lethal injection; voters approved the change in execution method. Prisoners sentenced to death in Arizona prior to November 15, 1992 still had the option to choose the gas chamber. Harding was the last prisoner executed in Arizona's gas chamber without having lethal injection as an option, although he was not the last person to die in Arizona's gas chamber overall; in 1999, Walter LaGrand, who was sentenced to death in 1982, requested the gas chamber as his method of execution. To date, he is the most recent person to be executed by cyanide gas in a gas chamber in the United States.\n\nCoverage of Harding's execution and its aftermath stated that the warden threatened to quit if he were required to perform another gas chamber execution. The New York Times and Newsweek claimed Attorney General Woods became ill and vomited at the sight of Harding's convulsions. Woods later disputed those claims and stated that while he found that the execution left a lasting impression with him and was disturbing, he still supported the death penalty in Harding's case and did not become ill at Harding's execution.\n\nSee also \n\n Capital punishment in Arizona\n Capital punishment in the United States\n List of people executed in Arizona\n\nReferences \n\n1949 births\n1992 deaths\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican spree killers\nPeople executed for murder\nExecuted American people\nExecuted spree killers\n20th-century executions by Arizona\n20th-century executions of American people\nPeople convicted of murder by Arizona\nPeople executed by gas chamber\n\nDonald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 – April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber and spree killer who was convicted of the January 25, 1980 murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon. He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. His execution was particularly noteworthy and controversial due to the fact that his death in the gas chamber took eleven minutes and was reportedly gruesome. Harding's execution ultimately provided momentum for the movement to provide Arizona death row inmates with a choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection.\n\nEarly life \nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. By the time a physician arrived to assist with the birth, Harding was struggling for air; this resulted in Harding incurring organic brain syndrome. He also suffered from neonatal jaundice. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding was a toddler, he was admitted to the Child Guidance Clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas, where a doctor treating him wrote in a report that his mother was \"very immature and narcissistic\" and unfit to care for her sons. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed.\n\nThe family stayed at the sanatorium for approximately 2 years before leaving, after which Harding moved repeatedly between living with his mother and his grandparents. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. Harding witnessed Brown beating his mother; while he was in school, he struggled with behavioral issues, including defiance and truancy. A doctor reported in February 1960, shortly before Harding turned 11, that Harding displayed suicidal tendencies when he was 9 years old, slashing his wrists and leaving a note in which he threatened to \"jump in a river.\" That same doctor noted that while Harding's brother Darryl displayed none of the problematic behaviors that Harding did, Donald Harding had \"expressed the desire to kill and choke people. . . . It is amazing the degree of psychopathy contained in a boy of this young age.\" The doctor attributed Harding's behavioral issues to his brain damage, which his mother also claimed was exacerbated by Harding falling from a crib and being struck by a swingset during his childhood. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. The tests confirmed that Harding suffered from organic brain damage and epileptic seizures.\n\nPre-Arizona criminal history \nHarding's first arrest occurred when he was 11 years old, when he was arrested for joyriding. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. These convictions resulted in Harding being placed in an adult maximum security prison, the Tucker Unit, where, in 1970, he was also convicted for attempting to escape from custody. During Harding's stay on death row, his attorneys would attribute further behavioral and developmental issues to Harding's time in prison as a teenager. While in the prison, Harding attempted suicide again. \n\nHarding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder.\n\nHarding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension. Harding's crime spree began with the attempted robbery of a prostitute in Chicago, Illinois, on September 27; on December 10, he robbed and murdered Stanton Winston Blanton in Dallas, Texas, although he was never charged with this murder. On December 18, he robbed a man named Ronald Svetgoff and stole his car and identification cards, the latter of which he would use to feign his identity when he relocated to Arizona. Meanwhile, Harding took multiple individuals and families hostage throughout Texas, Utah, and California throughout the rest of December 1979.\n\nOn January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. Harding remained in California, robbing and carjacking multiple individuals and couples. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. Huth's murder was not immediately discovered, and weeks following the murder, authorities still had not found a body. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California.

In September of that year, Terry Gross took over as presenter and producer; over 45 years later she remains its chief presenter. In 1985, WHYY launched a weekly half-hour edition of Fresh Air, which was distributed nationally by NPR. The show began daily national broadcasts in 1987. The show is composed primarily of interviews with prominent figures in various fields, among them entertainment and the arts, culture, journalism, and global current affairs. This main segment is followed by shorter segments, most often comprising coverage and reviews of events and new releases in various cultural and entertainment spheres. The subjects of these shorter segments include movies, books, stage plays, television programs, as well as recordings of popular music, jazz, and classical music. The \n\n The Fast Show, known as Brilliant in the US, is a BBC comedy sketch show that ran from 1994 to 1997, with specials in 2000 and 2014. The show's central performers were Paul Whitehouse, Charlie Higson, Simon Day, Mark Williams, John Thomson, Arabella Weir and Caroline Aherne. Other significant cast members included Felix Dexter, Paul Shearer, Rhys Thomas, Jeff Harding, Maria McErlane, Eryl Maynard, Colin McFarlane and Donna Ewin. Loosely structured and reliant on character sketches, running gags and many catchphrases, its fast-paced \"blackout\" style set it apart from traditional sketch series because of the number and relative brevity of its sketches; a typical half-hour TV sketch comedy of the period might have consisted of nine or ten major items, with contrived situations and extended setups, whereas the premiere episode featured 27 sketches in 30 minutes, with \n\n included Naomi Campbell and Jimmy Nail. The series was notable for being the first to feature the girl group Spice Girls. There was considerable tabloid backlash against the show due to its often amateurish production standards - the presenters had little experience of live television. It was similarly castigated in the broadsheets as 'witless'. Although the intention of the producers was to cash in on the Girl Power and ladette phenomena, feminist commentators complained that the show's style and content appealed to male chauvinistic stereotypes. Several so-called practical jokes on members of the audience were also clearly staged. Channel 4 subsequently placed the show at number 80 in its 100 Greatest TV Moments from Hell list.\n\n Its magazine format allowed for interviews, live music, features, and stunts involving studio guests and the live audience. Originally broadcast in the old The Word time slot of 11pm on a Friday night, The Girlie Show later occupied Channel 4's traditional \"post-pub\" time slot. As with The Word, the late night air-time meant that guests and presenters encouraged each other to be controversial. In the tradition of The Word, the show's content and its presenters were heavily hyped as being more edgy, dangerous, and 'ballsy' than other programmes on British Television. The show also featured a group of four \"Twentysomething\" males from Sunderland in the north-east of England called \"The Naked Apes\" (named after the book \n\n In 1990, with the explosion of the Madchester scene, Christian was recruited to host the Channel 4 youth entertainment show The Word, based on the format of his music magazine radio shows. The show was a mixture of pop music and teen attitude. The Word hosted many groups playing live for the first time on British TV. Christian remained its only continuous presenter until it finished its run in 1995. He went on to present Carlton Television's The Big City, Sky 1's pop music show The Hitmix, and The Football Show for Tyne Tees Television.

Both come from the same species of tree (Caesalpinia echinata), but Pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings, while being held roughly parallel to the bridge and perpendicular to the strings, to produce sound. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is \n\n The sound producing technique is also a little different from the modern violin technique. the performer, instead of using a regular bow, moves the strings with a tight rubber band tied to the ends of a wooden stick. To make the rubber band less slippery folk musicians will sometimes rub it with regular rosin or with a substance made of white flour mixed with honey and chopped walnuts.\n\n hook ; Nèi xián (内弦), inside or inner string, usually tuned to D4, nearest to player ; Wai xián (外弦), outside or outer string, usually tuned to A4 ; Qín ma (琴碼), bridge, made from wood ; Gong (弓), bow, has screw device to vary bow hair tension ; Gong gan (弓杆), bow stick, made from bamboo ; Gong máo (弓毛), bow hair, usually white horsehair ; Qín diàn (琴墊), pad, a piece of sponge, felt, or cloth placed between the strings and skin below the bridge to improve its sound ; Qín tuō (琴托) – base, a piece of wood \n\n The instrument consist of two parts, the main body, penamasa or dhorr which is similar to that of a violin and the bow, pena cheijing or chorr, which is more resembling an archery bow than a violin bow. The main body is made out of bamboo, 10 to 11 inches long and 1 to 1.25 inches girth, which is fixed to a coconut shell cut in half, through two holes bore through the shell. Two additional holes are also drilled on the coconut shell for acoustic purposes, one of which is covered by dried animal skin such as iguana skin and the other, left open. The tension of the string is controlled by a bamboo peg, called kaan and is fitted inside a hole drilled on the bamboo rod. A scroll, mogra, is also tied to the instrument tail. The bow is wooden and bears a curved flourish at one end which is made of metal. In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells. The string is traditionally made of horse hair but, sometimes, metal strings and strings made out of wood fiber are also used.\n\n g heavier than a violin bow. Bow hair is traditionally horsehair, though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hair sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound. The cello bow has also been used to play electric \n\nQuestion: What is the name of the device made of wood and horsehair that is used to play a violin?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Columbus, the namesake of the city, is also referenced near the center of the seal, where a ship of his fleet is depicted. The ship is completely enclosed in a circular yellow border. Surrounding this is a shield modeled on the design of the Flag of the United States, with 13 red and white stripes and 12 white stars (6 on either side of the \n\n The most prominent transgender flag design is the \"Transgender Pride Flag\", used as a symbol of transgender pride and diversity, and transgender rights. The Transgender Pride Flag was created by American trans woman Monica Helms in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona in 2000. The flag's design represents the transgender community, and consists of five horizontal stripes: two light blue, two pink, and one white in the center. Helms describes the meaning of the transgender pride flag as follows: \"\"The stripes at the top and bottom are light blue, the traditional color for baby boys. The stripes next to them are pink, the traditional color for baby girls. The stripe in the middle is white, for those who are transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender.\"\"\n\n The flag is dominated by a green, elongated and rigid letter \"E\" upon a white background. Geometrically, the flag can be divided three ways across and five ways down, all of equal size; the \"E\" fills the top and bottom fifth, the left most third and one third in the third fifth from the top. The E hence fills two thirds of the area of the elongated flag.\n\n The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag or the U.S. flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \"union\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and the Star-Spangled Banner.\n\n Creator DeBlase gave this explanation of the design: The flag is composed of nine horizontal stripes of equal width. From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. In the upper left quadrant of the flag is a large red heart.

Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources. Feeders may exist outside the hive, be designed to fit certain hive designs, be an integral part of a hive design, or be used separately inside the hive. Feeders may attach to the side of the hive, or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the hive or as a purpose-built hive component.\n\n Common amongst eusocial bees, females make up the worker and queen populations. The workers are responsible for tasks including nest defense, brood care, colony maintenance, and provisioning. The queen influences the physiology and behavior of the workers, which are infertile females. The only role the males plays is in reproduction; his function is to mate with the queen and supply the necessary genetic complementation for reproduction.\n\n Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates.\n\n As a social species, Apis cerana colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. There is generally only one queen bee whose sole responsibility it is to lay eggs; therefore, she is the mother of all the workers present in the colony. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the “drones,” whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season.\n\n Similar to most beehives, an M. beecheii colony has one fertile queen and numerous nonreproductive female worker bees. The queen that is fertile and lays eggs is known as the physogastric queen. However, in M. beecheii excess queens are produced, most of which are destined to remain virgins. These excess queens are almost always killed by workers before they are able to lay eggs.\n\nQuestion: What is the name given to the largest bee in a hive?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Milk and cream contain casein, which coagulates, when mixed with weak acids such as lemon, tonic water, or traces of wine. While this outcome is undesirable in most situations, some cocktails specifically encourage coagulation.\n\n Kerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur was created by Kerrygold in Ireland, under Ornua – the Home of Irish Dairy which is a Co-op owned by Ireland’s dairy processors, and in turn by Ireland’s dairy farmers. In April 2015, milk quotas were lifted in Europe. Ornua was looking for more ways to export larger quantities of milk. The launching of the cream liqueur was one of the outcomes. Currently, the product is sold solely in the US, Dublin Airport and O'Briens Off Licence, in Douglas, Cork The alcohol, chocolate, and cream from grass-fed cows, together with Irish whiskey from various distilleries, are homogenized to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier, casein. This process prevents separation of the alcohol and cream during storage for up to 24 months. Without the homogenization, the fat from the cream rises to the top of the product. The quantity of other ingredients is not disclosed but they include herbs, sugar, and caramel.\n\n but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the \"Irish coffee\" (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail. Stout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.\n\n served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top; special devices are sold for making it. Some bars in Southeast Asia serve a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey, sometimes without cream, under the name \"Irish coffee\". Many drinks of hot coffee with a distilled spirit, and cream floated on top—liqueur coffees—are given names derived from Irish coffee, although the names are not standardised. Irish cream coffee (also known as Baileys coffee) can be considered a variant of Irish coffee, but involves the use of Irish cream as a \"pre-mixed\" substitute for the whisky, cream and sugar. Jamaican coffee would be expected to be made with rum; Highland coffee, also called Gaelic coffee, with Scotch whisky; Russian coffee with vodka; and so on, and so forth.\n\n In 1988, the National Standards Authority of Ireland published Irish Standard I.S. 417: Irish Coffee. The standard has been cancelled at least as of 2020. Although whiskey, coffee and cream are the basic ingredients in all Irish coffee, there are variations in preparation: the choice of coffee and the methods used for brewing it differ significantly. The use of espresso machines or fully automatic coffee brewers is now typical: the coffee is either a caffè americano (espresso diluted with hot water) or some kind of filter coffee, often made using a coffee capsule. The cream used in some bars to make what is sold as \"Irish coffee\" is sometimes sprayed from a can. Some bartenders gently shake fresh cream to achieve a smooth layer on top of the coffee.

He became one of the most venerated saints and megalomartyrs in Christendom, and he has been especially venerated as a military saint since the Crusades. In hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. His memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. England, Ethiopia, Georgia, Catalonia and Aragon in Spain, Moscow in Russia, and several other states, regions, cities, universities, professions and organizations claim George as their patron. The bones of Saint George are buried in the Church of Saint George, Lod, Israel.\n\n  St. George stands in lavishly decorated armour, and appears relaxed and nonchalant, raising his helmet and left hand to introduce van der Paele. The saint was the donor's name saint and St. Donatian's Cathedral was built (c. 950) to house a relic of one of his arm bones. George's armour is similar to that of St. Michael in van Eyck's Dresden Triptych, while his steel shield resembles those in the Knights of Christ panel of the Ghent altarpiece. Art historian Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and unsure of himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer \"forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon\". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet \n\n The patron saint of this church is known as St. George. Before he became a Christian his name was Maherkoushap. St. George after was born in 576 AD in a branch of the Sasanian royal family. The 20-year-old was baptized in 596. He became a monk at Mt. Izla in northern Iraq and southern Turkey. When the Persian king heard that George changed his religion, he arrested and killed George in 615. He is an important saint in the Church of the East. On 24 April there is a feast for St. George and he is celebrated in Ankawa.\n\n Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r. 1042–1055) died after contracting pleurisy while bathing in the pond at the monastery of Saint George in January 1055. He was ultimately buried at the monastery. Years later, the palace that Emperor Monomachos built at Mangana was destroyed by Emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–1195 and 1203–1204), but the monastery complex of Saint George survived until the fall of Constantinople in May 1453. Since its construction, the Byzantine imperial court made annual visits to the monastery on April 23, which was the feast day of Saint George. This tradition was interrupted during the Fourth Crusade of the 13th century when Latin monks briefly occupied the monastery until it was restored to the Byzantine Greeks by Emperor \n\n Saint George of Drama, the new confessor and venerable (Greek: Ὁ Όσιος Γεώργιος της Δράμας, Georgian: დრამის წმინდა გიორგი), January 1, 1901 – November 4, 1959, was a Greek Elder known for his gifts of spiritual discernment and clairvoyance. George Karslidis was born in 1901 in Chadik, Tsalka, Georgia. His grandparents were refugees who had come from Gümüşhane, Ottoman Empire, following the Crimean War. At a young age, he is orphaned, losing both his father and his mother on the same day. Wounded by the abusive treatment given to him by his older brother, he escaped, alone, to the mountains, \n\nQuestion: In which year did St George die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Every generation there are four people who commit a grievous sin and are assigned to become the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Rose Arvale, the Horseman of Death, is the leader of the current generation, and they want to use The Man's meteorite as their ultimate weapon for the end of humanity. In contrast to the angel Messengers, the Horsemen immediately become aware of their powers upon a seal being broken as well as their destiny, and about each other's identity. It is also implied that all four of them are telepathic (only to each other) and can read each other's minds.\n\n as implying an Augustinian universe, created good. The Jesuit John L. Treloar writes that the Book of Revelation personifies evil in the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: the first, on a white horse, represents a conquering king; the second, red with a sword, means bloody war; the third, black and carrying a scale balance, means famine; and the last, green, is named death. Treloar comments that the personification increases the emotional impact, and that the Ringwraiths (Nazgûl) are introduced \"as terror inspiring horsemen who bring these four evils into the world. They are bent on conquest, war, [and] death, and the land they rule is non-productive.\"\n\n A number of miniatures detail the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, individually and in groups. The knightly saints are identified through the colour mainly associated with them; St. George rides a white horse (associated with a royal steed), St. Theodore, holding the scales offamine, sits on a \"gloomy\" black horse, and St. Demetrius a red horse, (associated with the color of blood). The fourth horseman Death, rides a pale horse, traditionally \"the color of decay\", according to art historian Helmut Nickel.\n\nQuestion: What are the names of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Only Davis, Hendry and Williams have won all three Triple Crown events in the same season. Hendry is the only player to achieve the feat twice, in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons. After winning the 1999 Masters, John Higgins held all three Triple Crown titles at the same time but his victories spanned two seasons. Only O'Sullivan and Hendry have managed to successfully defend all three Triple Crown events. In 2013, Robertson became the first player from outside the United Kingdom to complete the career Triple Crown. Following his win in the 2018 UK Championship, O'Sullivan surpassed Hendry's previous record of 18 and now has won 20 Triple Crown titles. Trump is the most recent player to have achieved a career Triple Crown, winning the Masters and World Championship in the 2018–19 snooker season.\n\n The World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport of snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. The world championship sees 32 professional players compete in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several. The 32 players for the event are selected through a mix of the world snooker rankings, and pre-tournament qualification rounds. The first world championship was held in 1927 taking place in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England and was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. Stephen Hendry is the most successful player in the modern era, having won the championship 7 times. The previous year's championship was won by England's Stuart Bingham, who won the event defeating Shaun Murphy in the final 18–15. This was Bingham's first championship. The winner of the 2016 event earned prize money of £330,000, from a total pool of £1.5 million. The event was the tenth and last ranking event of the 2015–2016 season.\n\n The first-time world champions listed below all experienced the \"Crucible curse\", as they did not successfully defend their title at the following year's World Championship. In the years that are not listed, the \"curse\" was not applicable because the previous year's championship was won by a player who had held the world title previously. Of the eighteen players to have won their first world title at the Crucible Theatre, six lost in their first match as defending champion: Terry Griffiths in 1980, Steve Davis in 1982, Dennis Taylor in 1986, Graeme Dott in 2007, Neil Robertson in 2011, and Stuart Bingham in 2016. Most recently, Judd Trump fell to the curse at the quarter-final stage. Only two of the eighteen were able to reach the final as defending champions: Joe Johnson in 1987 and Ken Doherty in 1998. Four players have won consecutive world titles at the Crucible (having already won the championship previously): Steve Davis (1983–1984 and 1987–1989), Stephen Hendry (1992–1996), Ronnie O'Sullivan (2012–2013), and Mark Selby (2016–2017). All of these players had already experienced the \"Crucible curse\" after winning their first world title.\n\n  Scotland has produced many great snooker players over the years, many of which have gone on to win the World Championship. Walter Donaldson was the first Scotsman to be crowned World Champion, winning in 1947 and again in 1950. In the modern snooker era the most successful Scottish snooker player is Stephen Hendry. He has won the World Snooker Championship a record 7 times, winning it 5 years in a row from 1992 onwards and holds the record as being the youngest ever winner, beating Englishman Jimmy White 18 frames to 12 in 1990 aged just 21 years. Between 1990 and 2012 Scottish players reached the final on 16 occasions, with Scots winning 12 Championships in that time. As well as Hendry's record 7 wins, John Higgins and Graeme Dott have also won the title. In 1996, the Scotland Team of Stephen Hendry, John Higgins and Alan McManus won the Snooker World Cup.\n\n The 1991 World Snooker Championship (also referred to as the 1991 Embassy World Snooker Championship for the purposes of sponsorship) was a professional ranking snooker tournament that took place between 20 April and 6 May 1991 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. Stephen Hendry was the defending champion, but he lost in the quarter-finals to Steve James and thus fell to the Crucible curse, becoming another champion who was unable to defend his first world title. John Parrott won his only World Championship title by defeating Jimmy White 18–11 in the final. It was the third time that White had lost in the final after 1984 and 1990. The tournament was sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Embassy. The highest break of the tournament was 140, made by Jimmy White.\n\nQuestion: Who were the four different Snooker World Champions in the 1990s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket. Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million. A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for \n\n Secretary of State. Leadership of the Department of Defense went to Dick Cheney, who had previously served as Gerald Ford's chief of staff and would later serve as vice president under his son George W. Bush. Jack Kemp joined the administration as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, while Elizabeth Dole, the wife of Bob Dole and a former Secretary of Transportation, became the Secretary of Labor under Bush. Bush retained several Reagan officials, including Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos. New Hampshire Governor John Sununu, a strong supporter of Bush during the 1988 campaign, became chief of staff. Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.\n\n This article lists those who were potential candidates for the Republican nomination for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. On March 7, 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush won the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States, and became the presumptive nominee. On July 25, 2000, former Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney was chosen as his running mate. The Bush–Cheney ticket would go on to defeat the Democratic tickets of Gore–Lieberman in 2000 and Kerry–Edwards in 2004.\n\n After his selection by Republican primary voters as presumptive presidential nominee, Bush asked Dick Cheney to lead the selection committee for his vice president nominee. As the vice presidential vetter, Cheney required at least 11 potential candidates to fill out \"an extraordinarily detailed, 83-question form\" delving into their backgrounds. This list includes names that had been mentioned in several sources as the candidates\n\n Bush had initially chosen Dick Cheney to lead the search for his vice presidential running mate. In 1992, Bush had supported Cheney as a replacement for Dan Quayle on his father's ultimately unsuccessful national ticket. After more than three months of extensive research, Cheney recommended John Danforth to be the nominee, as the other choices' strengths were offset by liberal stances. Bush heavily considered Danforth, but ultimately asked Cheney himself to be the nominee. By picking Cheney, Bush had a running mate who had years of experience as well as an extensive foreign policy expertise. After Cheney, who was serving as CEO of Halliburton, reported his findings back to Bush, Bush surprised pundits by asking Cheney himself to be his running mate. Bush told supporters that regional considerations would have less bearing on his decision than the candidate's ability to take over the office of the presidency. At the selection announcement, Bush said that Cheney, who had worked under all five presidential administrations between 1969 and 1993, was qualified, respected and shared his vision for America.\n\nQuestion: Who is the Vice-President for George W Bush?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Americans had a secret alternate plan to the Apollo program, the fictional program Pilgrim, in case this happened.

She becomes increasingly frustrated by Captain Glenn (Wilson), who harbors a secret of his own, namely his failed relationship with the previous co-pilot, Daniel.

He played the lead character, Sergeant John Trenton, an American commando, captured and tortured for information during his mission. In 1999 the actor filmed his scenes for the Clint Eastwood-directed adventure drama Space Cowboys. He portrayed the U.S. Air Force navigator named \"Tank\" Sullivan as a young man, while James Garner played his older self. The movie was released in August 2000 to positive critical reception.

This game can deal (rarely) unsolvable right away if no kings appear. Also, if two foundations of the same suit hold a card of their own suit (not the King) the game cannot be solved. Just start a new game, or fetch some kings from the stock and replace them to the right location, or swap cards on the foundations to avoid this. The whole tableau consists of free cells that each hold one card. It is not possible to move a card from the foundation to a free cell. Only from a foundation to the other. The game is played by fetching card by card from the stock to the waste. Marry matching cards from the waste to the foundations or place them on empty free cells. The foundations, arranged as pyramid, have fixed suits. The starting cards are: K of Hearts (top), Kings of Spades (row 2), Kings of Diamonds (row 3), Kings of Clubs (bottom row) and Ace of Hearts (bottom center).\n\n The queen of spades (Q) is one of 52 playing cards in a standard deck: the queen of the suit of spades. In Old Maid and several games of the Hearts family, it serves as a single, undesirable card in the deck.\n\n The deck consists of a traditional 52-card deck with both Jokers included, making a 54-card deck. Ace is always high and the highest playable card, but is not the most valuable. The Off-Jack is the non-trump Jack of the same color. For instance, if the trump suit is Spades, the Off-Jack would be the Jack of Clubs, Jack of Clubs will therefore be a Spade instead of a Club. The Three is among the lowest-ranked cards, but is the most valuable as it is worth three points. The Two is an automatic point, as the player of the Two always keeps it. Teams are chosen randomly by having each player draw a single card from a facedown deck. The two highest cards and the two lowest cards become teammates and sit crosswise from each other.\n\n First, one king and one ace are removed from the deck and placed in two columns: one with all aces and the other with all kings. In between these two columns is a space for the reserve, which is composed of nine cards arranged in three rows of three cards each. Ace and King columns are the foundations. The ace foundations are built up to Kings while the king foundations are built down to aces, all by suit. When the top cards of the ace and king foundations of the same suit are in sequence, a reversal can be done, i.e. cards can be moved one at a time from one foundation to the other, except the base aces and kings. The nine reserve cards are available for play \n\n The 32 suit cards consist of eight cards each in the four French suits of Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, and Clubs, all suits being of equal rank. Four cards in each suit form are the court cards or \"figures\" (Figuren). In descending order they are the King (König), Queen (Dame), Cavalier (Cavall) and Jack (Bube). The Cavalier, also called the Knight (Reiter), is unusual for Tarock beginners who are only familiar with games using the standard French pack. It is often confused with the Jack or King.

If the player has spent too much time killing gremlins, this often makes it impossible for Felix to go back for the oil in time. There is a warning 'flicker' as the oil reaches a low level but unless Felix is already on the conveyor belt with a can of oil, it will be too late. If the generator runs out of oil, it is game over. If Felix successfully tops up the generator with oil, the gremlins regenerate (and sometimes increase in number) and play begins again.\n\n A gremlin is a mischievous folkloric creature that causes malfunctions in aircraft or other machinery. Depictions of these creatures vary. Often, they are described or depicted as animals with spiky backs; large, strange eyes; and small, clawed frames featuring sharp teeth. Since World War II, different fantastical creatures have been referred to as gremlins, bearing varying degrees of resemblance to the originals. The term \"gremlin\", denoting a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft, originates in Royal Air Force (RAF) slang among the British pilots stationed in Malta, the Middle East, and India in the 1920s, with the earliest recorded printed use being in a poem published in the journal Aeroplane in Malta on 10 April 1929. Later sources have sometimes claimed that the concept goes back to World War I, but there is no print evidence of this.\n\n one character set in one location for inspiration, such as Aliens (1986) and Locke (2013). Principal photography began in June 2019 in Auckland, New Zealand. In a prologue to Shadow in the Cloud, an animated training film from the United States Army Air Forces depicts the havoc a gremlin can produce for the unwary or complacent airman during wartime. When the film continues, the gremlin—a metaphor for problems caused by inattention and/or negligence—is depicted as a living, malevolent creature. During the end credits, archival footage is shown of women serving in the British and American air forces in the Second World War.\n\n Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai is an upcoming American animated fantasy comedy streaming television series that is set to be released on HBO Max in the United States. The series will consist of 10 episodes and serve as a prequel to the 1984 film Gremlins and its 1990 sequel The New Batch. Set in 1920s Shanghai, East China, Secrets of the Mogwai will tell the story of how 10-year-old Sam Wing met Gizmo, a young Mogwai. It will be written and executive produced by Tze Chun. Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Sam Register, and Brendan Hay also serve as executive producers. In February 2021, ahead of the series premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. The series will air on Cartoon Network as part of their ACME Night block.\n\n Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante, is loosely inspired by Roald Dahl's characters, featuring evil and destructive monsters which mutate from small furry creatures. Murray Futterman, a WWII veteran calls the creatures \"Real Gremlins\".

The Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis) is a Macaronesian endemic bat, and Canary big-eared bat (Plecotus teneriffae) is a Canary Islands endemic.\n\n The Canary Islands oystercatcher, Canarian oystercatcher, or Canarian black oystercatcher (Haematopus meadewaldoi), was a shorebird of uncertain taxonomy endemic to Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and their offshore islets (Islote de Lobos and the Chinijo Archipelago) in the Canary Islands, Spain. It is now considered to be extinct. The Canary Islands oystercatcher has had a complicated taxonomic history. Though it was long known to naturalists, it was considered a mere local population or subspecies of the African oystercatcher (Haematopus moquini) until 1913; these two were at the time occasionally lumped as subspecies of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). Hockey (1982) concluded that the Canary Islands oystercatcher was actually a full species, distinct from the African oystercatcher. However, DNA analyses conducted in 2018 and published in 2019 concluded that the Canary Islands oystercatcher was most likely a subspecies of the common Eurasian oystercatcher.\n\n The Canary Islands oystercatcher was apparently an all-year resident, and seems to have never bred or even strayed outside the eastern Canaries at least in historic times. Information about its ecology are scant and usually second-hand or inferred from circumstantial information. However, even though conjectural, these informations are consistent as the biology of oystercatchers is not very variable and the species was a conspicuous bird well known to locals. It was called cuervo marino (\"sea raven\") on Fuerteventura, grajo de mar (\"sea chough\" ) on Lanzarote, and corvino (\"little raven\") on Graciosa. In addition, the local name lapero (\"limpet-eater\") was also used, possibly on Alegranza. The Canary Islands oystercatcher was in all likelihood a bird of the rocky shore rather \n\n Calicut, where Europeans first obtained it; Calico cat and calico horse derive from the appearance of their mottled coat suggesting calico cloth ; canary — a small yellow bird, originating on and named after the Canary Islands, specifically the largest island, Gran Canaria, called in Latin Insula Canaria, \"island of dogs\", after the wild native dogs found there ; Capri pants — mid-calf pants named for the Italian isle of Capri, where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s. ; Caucasian — name for the \"white race\", coined by anthropologist Johann Blumenbach after Caucasus Mountains, their supposed ancestral homeland ; \n\n The name Islas Canarias is likely derived from the Latin name Canariae Insulae, meaning \"Islands of the Dogs\", a name that was evidently generalized from the ancient name of one of these islands, Canaria – presumably Gran Canaria. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the island Canaria contained \"vast multitudes of dogs of very large size\". Other theories speculate that the name comes from the Nukkari Berber tribe living in the Moroccan Atlas, named in Roman sources as Canarii, though Pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs. The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms. It is considered that the aborigines of Gran Canaria called themselves \"Canarios\". It is possible that after being conquered, this name was used in plural in Spanish, i.e., as to refer to all of the islands as the Canarii-as. The name of the islands is not derived from the canary bird; rather, the birds are named after the islands.\n\nQuestion: The Canary Islands are named after what animal?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She has sold near five million records as a solo artist, including over 1.4 million albums in the United States. Stone's career began as a member of the hip hop trio The Sequence in the late 1970s. In 1999, she released her first solo album, Black Diamond (2003) on Arista Records. It debuted at number 46 on the US Billboard 200 and peaked at number nine on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, eventually selling more than 750,000 copies. Black Diamond was awarded gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the \n\n \"Hey Negrita\" is a song by English rock band the Rolling Stones that appeared on their 1976 album Black and Blue. Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Ron Wood apparently wrote the song's main riff, a piece of music he took with him to Munich's Musicland Studios where he and other guitarists were auditioning for the second guitarist slot left open after the departure of Mick Taylor. For his contribution, Wood would receive an \"inspiration by\" credit on the album. In 2003, Wood recounted, \"All of us, independently and together, were into reggae, and it was also a mood of the \n\n In 2007, Rolling Stone referred to Boyd as a \"legendary rock muse\" for her role in inspiring the music of Harrison and Clapton, while Alan Light of The New York Times described the Boyd–Clapton–Harrison love triangle as \"one of the most mythical romantic entanglements in rock'n'roll history\". Roger Cormier of Mental Floss similarly recognises her as \"one of the most important muses in rock and roll history\". In addition to \"Layla\", she was the inspiration for Clapton's love songs \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\". He also wrote \"Golden Ring\" for Boyd, in response to her sadness at learning of Harrison's marriage to Olivia Arias in 1978, and the 1983 track \"The Shape You're In\", which addressed Boyd's drinking.\n\n Marsha Hunt (born April 15, 1946) is an American actress, novelist, singer and former model, who has lived mostly in Britain and Ireland. She achieved national fame when she appeared in London as Dionne in the long-running rock musical Hair. She enjoyed close relationships with Marc Bolan and Mick Jagger, who is the father of her only child Karis. According to Hunt, The Rolling Stones' controversial hit song \"Brown Sugar\" was based on her. She has written three novels, as well as three volumes of autobiography, which include a frank account of life as a breast cancer sufferer.\n\n Patricia Anne Boyd (born 17 March 1944) is an English model and photographer. She was one of the leading international models during the 1960s and, with Jean Shrimpton, epitomised the British female look of the era. Boyd married George Harrison in 1966 and experienced the height of the Beatles' popularity as well as sharing in their embrace of Indian spirituality. She divorced Harrison in 1977 and married Harrison's friend Eric Clapton in 1979; they divorced in 1989. Boyd inspired Harrison's songs \"I Need You\", \"If I Needed Someone\", \"Something\" and \"For You Blue\", and Clapton's songs \"Layla\", \"Bell Bottom Blues\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\". In August 2007, Boyd published her autobiography Wonderful Today (titled Wonderful Tonight in the United States).

As of 23 June 2012, 36 men's world records have been ratified by the IAAF in the event. The first world record in the women's decathlon was recognized by the IAAF in 2004. As of 21 June 2009, two world records have been ratified by the IAAF in the event. The current world record holder in the decathlon is French national Kevin Mayer. Over the years athletes have become bigger, stronger, and faster; in turn athletes scored more points leading to the world record where it stands now at 9126 points by the current world record holder Kevin Mayer.\n\n improved upon the record at low altitude, indoors, but at the time indoor records were not recognized as world records. ; Decathlon Bill Toomey's World Decathlon best in the 400 metres, 45.6 (45.68 FAT) lasted almost 47 years until it was beaten by Ashton Eaton while setting the world record in 2015. ; Men's 4x100 Relay record was set three times in Mexico City, including both semi-finals and the final by the 🇺🇸 which lasted until the next Olympics ; Men's 4x400 Relay record by the 🇺🇸 lasted almost 24 years (although it was equalled after 20 years). ; Women's 100 meter record, set by Wyomia Tyus 🇺🇸 lasted almost 4 years. \n\n The title of \"World's Greatest Athlete\" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. These competitions require an athlete to possess the whole spectrum of athletic ability in order to be successful including speed, strength, coordination, jumping ability, and endurance. Although the title \"World's Greatest Athlete\" seems a natural fit for these two events, its traditional association with the decathlon/heptathlon officially began with Jim Thorpe. During the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won the gold medal in the Decathlon (among others). Thorpe competed professionally in baseball, American football, and basketball; and competed collegiately in track and field, baseball, lacrosse, and did ballroom dancing. King Gustav V of Sweden, while awarding Thorpe the decathlon gold, said: \"Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.\" That title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since.\n\nDay 1: 100 metres, long jump, shot put, high jump, and 400 metres ; Day 2: 110 hurdles, pole vault, discus, javelin, and 1500 metres The player takes part in the ten events of the modern decathlon:  The player starts the game with three lives; failure to reach the minimum standard in an event results in the loss of one life. Success in the 1500 metres event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria. Depending on the computer, running is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible or by moving the joystick from side to side as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation among players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.

With World War II continuing, the 1944 Olympic games were again cancelled, and with the cancellation, Watson lost his second and final chance to compete for an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon. Watson continued training in 1944 to defend his A.A.U. decathlon championship, but a sinus attack forced him to withdraw from the competition. At the time, Detroit police officer Watson said, \"I sure am sorry to miss the decathlon, because I think I could have won it again.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the final event in a decathlon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title). Other instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl). None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).\n\n Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have a storied rivalry that many consider to be the greatest in tennis history. As they entered the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, the two men had collectively won the last nine consecutive Grand Slam titles. The 2007 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was a rematch of the previous year's Championships final. Federer had won not only that match, but had also been the Wimbledon champion four years in a row and was on a quest of tying Björn Borg's record of five consecutive Wimbledon Championships. Nadal, on the other hand, had just won the French Open for the third time in a row and was trying to achieve the rare French Open-Wimbledon double. Additionally, Nadal had denied Federer from completing the Career Grand Slam, and becoming the first man since 1968 to win all four Grand Slams consecutively. The hype preceding the match was enormous because although Federer was the four-time defending champion, Nadal entered the match with an 8-4 lead in their head-to-head record.\n\n  This match was historic as it saw Federer equal Björn Borg's open-era record of five consecutive Wimbledon Championships. Due to this potential Borg returned to the All England Club for the first time in many years to witness the Wimbledon final. The victory also equalled Federer with Borg and Rod Laver with 11 Grand Slam championships, leaving him only three behind Pete Sampras in his quest to achieve the all-time record. This was the first Wimbledon final to use the replay technology system Hawk-Eye. The system proved controversial reversing a set point for Federer in the first set. In the fourth set Federer grew frustrated with almost all of the reviews going Nadal's way \n\n The 2008 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London in the United Kingdom. It was the 122nd edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 23 June to 6 July 2008. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year. Spanish player Rafael Nadal won the first Wimbledon title of his career; the first Grand Slam tournament he had won other than the French Open. Nadal defeated five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final in what many regard as the greatest tennis match of all time. In the women's singles, Venus Williams claimed her fifth title, and first win over her sister Serena in a Wimbledon final (she had lost the previous two). The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd. Following the completion of the 2007 Championships, the new fixed roof was put in place, in time for the 2008 Championships. The retractable section of the new roof was completed for the 2009 Championships.\n\n In 1947, he paired with Jack Kramer and they won the Wimbledon doubles title. A year later, in 1948, Falkenburg reached the pinnacle of his tennis career by winning the Wimbledon singles championship. He won the acclaimed tennis crown, after winning 3 of 5 sets against Australian John Bromwich. Bromwich had a match point at 5–3 in the fifth set, but Falkenburg saved three match points and went on to win 7–5 in the fifth set. It took 71 years before Falkenburg's feat was repeated. At Wimbledon in 2019, Novak Djokovic fought off Roger Federer by saving two championship points in the fifth and final set to win the men's title for the fifth time. Falkenburg won Wimbledon because he was not only a great tennis player, but a superb strategist. Fellow tennis player Tom Brown, who was a runner up in the 1947 Wimbledon Championships described Falkenburg's competitive approach, \"He would review the situation, figure out what was likely, and take chances.\"\n\nQuestion: Peter Simple, Jack Horner and Ben Nevis have all won which famous sporting event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The megaprojects plan by the AK Party of Turkey sparked controversy and political turmoil about the management of a faltering economy. Others believe the project is visionary and will boost the country's touristic economy and infrastructure investments. The megaprojects plan on the canal has also sparked environmental controversy where environmentalists have warned that the infrastructures could damage the canal ecosystem, making it uninhabitable. On another end, supporters are raving about the way the project is generating growth in the economy where the president replied with the statement, \"We invested billions in Istanbul, and now they say we robbed the country?\", accusing opponents of the AK Party of peddling lies and sparking controversy.\n\n  Eminönü is a former district of Istanbul in Turkey, currently a quarter within the Fatih district, which is the capital district of Istanbul and of Istanbul Province. Eminönü covers roughly the area on which the ancient city of Byzantium was built. The Galata Bridge crosses the Golden Horn and connects Karaköy (historic Galata) at north with Eminönü at south. Eminönü is located at the point where the Golden Horn connects with the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait, near the Sea of Marmara. Up on the hill stands Topkapı Palace, the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii) and Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya). It was a part of the Fatih district until 1928, which covered the whole peninsular area (the old Stamboul) within the Roman city walls - that area which was formerly the Byzantine capital Constantinople. Since the resident population of Eminönü is low today, it rejoined the capital district Fatih in 2009.\n\n  According to the data of the Association of the Touristic Hotels and Investors (TUROB) of the Republic of Turkey, at the end of 2010, 766 accommodation establishments of different categories in Istanbul (licensed by the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Turkey and/or the municipality of Istanbul) had the total of 46,652 rooms and 93,299 beds. That capacity alone was sufficient to accommodate the annual volume of 10 million tourists. At the same time, another 51 new hotels (of which 25 were 5-star hotels) were at various stages of development at the end of 2010, bringing another 9,512 rooms and 19,800 beds to the already existing capacity. With the completion of these new hotels, Istanbul's accommodation capacity will have reached, within a few years, the total of 817 hotels, 56,164 rooms and 113,990 beds.  As the ninth most visited city in the world and the ninth most popular congress destination in the world, Istanbul is also the location for a number of international hotel chains, hosting, as of September 2015, 106 operating international chain hotels, with further 31 such hotels scheduled to open before late 2017. In 2013, Istanbul was selected the best holiday destination in Europe.\n\n Istanbul is a city where more than 15 million people with various backgrounds, languages, religions and cultures live together in peace. It is a city that connects the continents of Europe and Asia via its many bridges. It is a meeting place where new ideas and concepts from both continents intermingle on a stage provided by the beautiful historic hills of a city decorated with monuments of bygone super-powers. Most importantly, Istanbul is a city that represents civilization, peaceful coexistence and beauty. Istanbul Center was established to live up to the ideals its name represents.\n\n In recent years, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has made huge investments on intelligent transportation systems and public transportation. Despite that, traffic is a significant problem in İstanbul. İstanbul has chosen the second most congested and the most sudden-stopping traffic in the world. Travel times in Turkey's largest city take on average 55 percent longer than they should, even in relatively less busy hours.\n\nQuestion: What is the largest city in Turkey?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn). The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the \n\n Crown Colonies which extend from roughly Virginia south to Georgia.

New York covers an area of 54,556 square miles (141,299 km2) making it the 27th largest state by total area (but 30th by land area). The state borders six U.S. states: Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the south, and Connecticut, Rhode Island (across Long Island Sound), Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east. New York also borders the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec to the north. Additionally, New York touches the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and two of the Great Lakes: Lake Erie to the west and Lake Ontario to the northwest.\n\n The following is a bibliography of New York. New York is a U.S. state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States. New York is commonly known as the \"Empire State\" and sometimes the \"Excelsior State\".

It became her sixteenth top ten album, and placed her third amongst women for the most top ten entries, after Madonna with nineteen and Barbra Streisand with thirty. It also peaked at number one on both the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the Top Holiday Albums chart (her second to do so on the latter, following Merry Christmas in 1994). The album also peaked at number seven on the Digital Albums chart. It was certified Gold denoting shipments exceeding 500,000 copies \n\n Elton John to revive an old hit of his, \"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\". Amazingly, despite charting for 31 years, this was only Elton's 5th UK No. 1 single. Popstars: The Rivals became the new phenomenon in the world of talent shows and it produced 2 new acts, boyband One True Voice and girl group Girls Aloud. They both released their singles in Christmas week and the girls beat the boys to the top spot, claiming the Christmas number one with their debut single, \"Sound of the Underground\". The song topped the charts for 4 weeks, and escalated them to great fame. They have had continued success for 6 years releasing 20 top 10 singles and 6 successful albums, but One True Voice quickly disappeared \n\n \"Mama\" was released in the UK as a double A-side single with \"Who Do You Think You Are\" on 3 March 1997. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number one, with sales of 248,000 copies, becoming the group's fourth consecutive chart-topper. This achievement made the Spice Girls the first act in UK chart history to have its first four singles reach number one, breaking the record set by Gerry & The Pacemakers, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, and Robson & Jerome with three number ones each. It spent three weeks at number one, nine weeks in the top forty, fifteen \n\n Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (No. 1, 1984, the second-biggest selling single in UK Chart history; two re-recordings also hit No. 1 in 1989 and 2004), Slade's \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" (No. 1, 1973), and Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" (No. 2, 1984).

ABC aired five episodes of this spin-off during the week of February 22, 2004, and an additional seven episodes later that year in May. As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000. Contestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip (see Lifelines).\n\n  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (מי רוצה להיות מיליונר?, translit. Mi Rotze Lihyot Milyoner?), also often referred to as just Millionaire, was an Israeli game show based on the original British format of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Having started broadcasting in 1999 on Channel 2, the show was hosted by Yoram Arbel, and shown on Channel 10. It returned in 2020 on Channel 12 with Erez Tal, who had guest hosted an episode in 2003. One contestant, Izhar Nevo, has won the top prize, on 7 August 2000. Nevo used his final lifeline, 50/50, on the last question and when still unsure of the answer tossed a coin to pick from the remaining two to win the top prize.\n\n As in the syndicated United States' version, contestants were selected for the show through a qualifying test instead of the traditional \"Fastest Finger First\" as seen on the British version. Contestants sit in the \"Hot Seat\" and are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Questions are multiple choice and contestants choose between a possible four answers, sometimes with the aid of lifelines. On answering a question correctly the contestant plays for a bigger sum of money, getting ever closer to the maximum amount of one million dollars. The traditional 15-question money tree was used and there was no clock. The complete sequence of prizes is as follows. Guaranteed safe levels, where the contestant is guaranteed this amount of money to take home, regardless of any subsequent questions they may get wrong, are in bold. The contestants' run ends when they either answer a question incorrectly, decide to not answer a question and walk away with their prize money, or if they answer all 15 questions correctly (winning $1 million).\n\n Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Hot Seat was an Indonesian game show based on the original British format of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. It was broadcast by RCTI from Monday, September 13, 2010 at 17.30 (UTC+7). The host was Ferdi Hasan. Despite its name, the top prize was a quarter of billion Indonesian rupiah, however since September 19, the top prize was increased to half a billion rupiahs, and the money tree was changed. It can be earned by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. The only lifeline was pass. October 31, 2010 was the last day the show aired on RCTI, fueling rumors of cancellation. Unlike the previous 2 'classic' Millionaire ever aired in Indonesia, this time the format used is the Hot Seat format, similar to the Australian version. Several of the first 5 questions usually have 3 joke answers and 1 correct answer.\n\n On 9 September 2001, Ingram became a contestant on the ITV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, following his wife Diana and her brother Adrian Pollock, who had each won £32,000 as contestants on the show. To prepare, Ingram practised for about twenty minutes per day on a homemade \"Fastest Finger First\" machine. Ingram got into the \"hot seat\" but used two lifelines early, ending the day at £4,000 and with only the 50/50 lifeline remaining. The production team doubted he would proceed much further when filming resumed, but he surprised them and reached the jackpot of £1 million.

They entered the Cup Winners' Cup after a 23-year exile from European competitions, and reached the semi-finals where they went out to a single Real Zaragoza goal, ending their hopes of an all-English final with Arsenal. The summer of 1995 saw manager Glenn Hoddle bring in two of the most famous names in world football, Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes. He also terminated the contract of misfit striker Robert Fleck as well as deciding to end his own playing career.

The latter match, against VfB Stuttgart in Stockholm, was Clarke's final appearance for the club. In 2005, he was voted into Chelsea's centenary XI, occupying the right-back berth. Speaking in February 2019, Clarke said he was thankful that Chelsea had signed him as it meant that he and his family no longer had to live with religious sectarianism in the west of Scotland.\n\n  Runners-up: Championship play-off final (2005—06) On 21 January 2005, Krasner announced the sale of a 50% stake to Ken Bates for £10m and Bates became the club's new chairman, replacing Krasner. This investment effectively saved Leeds United from going into administration. Bates had previously headed three other league football clubs, most famously Leeds' old rivals Chelsea.

Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.

With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n The Full Monty won the BAFTA Award for Best Film in 1997, beating presumed frontrunners Titanic and L.A. Confidential and Carlyle won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was nominated for a total of four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Original Screenplay. In 1997, the Academy Award for Best Original Score was split up into two categories: Dramatic and Musical or Comedy. In light of 1997's big winner, Titanic, the film won only the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score by Anne Dudley, with the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars going to Titanic and its director James Cameron and the Best Original Screenplay Oscar going to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for Good Will Hunting. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. In 1999, it was ranked #25 on the BFI Top 100 British films list. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted The Full Monty the 49th greatest comedy film of all time. By that year it earned an estimated £170 million at the box office worldwide.\n\n screenplay and Leonardo DiCaprio were not nominees. It was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King would also match this record in 2004. Titanic won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The film's soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, and became a worldwide success, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.

There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as Harvest at La Crau. The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He was confident, clear-minded and seemingly content. His work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism and Japanese art (see Japonism) from his period in Paris the prior two years. His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, impasto brush strokes.\n\n The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus, The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in Western art.\n\n Seine (paintings) is the subject and location of paintings that Vincent van Gogh made in 1887. The Seine has been an integral part of Parisian life for centuries for commerce, travel and entertainment. Here van Gogh primarily captures the respite and relief from city life found in nature. A few of the paintings were made in Paris and the rest in the northwestern suburbs of Paris in Clichy and Asnières. Through these works the audience can see a transition in his work from one of dark colors and serious themes to more joyous use of color and light and choice of themes. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as cousin-in-law Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School. In Paris van Gogh was exposed to and influenced by Impressionism, Symbolism, Pointillism, and Japanese woodblock print genres which were overtime integrated into his works. The spring of 1887 seemed to trigger an awakening within van Gogh where he experimented with the genres to develop his personal style.\n\n In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a Dutch realist painter and leading member of the Hague School, who had a significant early impact on Vincent van Gogh. To dull colors, van Gogh often added black to his paintings.\n\n Vincent van Gogh is an 1886 oil on canvas portrait painting by Australian artist John Russell. It depicts Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, who befriended Russell after meeting him at Fernand Cormon's atelier in Paris, which they both attended. Painted in a realist and academic manner, the portrait shows hints of the impressionist techniques that Russell and Van Gogh began experimenting with in the latter half of the 1880s. It is the earliest of three portraits painted of Van Gogh from life by his contemporaries, the other two being Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887) and Paul Gauguin's The Painter of Sunflowers (1888). Van Gogh seems to have been particularly attached to Russell's portrait, which the Australian gifted to him as a mark of their friendship. The painting passed from Van Gogh to his brother Theo, then to their family, and is now in the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nQuestion: What nationality was the painter Vincent Van Gogh?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She collaborates with James Bond (Daniel Craig) to stop her boss, but is captured and killed by Silva. Marlohe had secured the role after two auditions for director Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. She looked to Xenia Onatopp, the female villain of the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye, as a point of inspiration for her performance.

Washington was a statesman, soldier, and surveyor. He was also the Commander-in-chief the Army from June 15, 1775, to December 23, 1783, then again from July 3, 1798, to December 14, 1798. Washington was elected President of the United States and served in that role from April 30, 1789, until March 3, 1797. The original bust was sculpted by French sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon in 1785 at George Washington's home, Mount Vernon, in Virginia. It is believed that Washington posed for the original sculpture. This bust was used \n\n Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill. His likeness also appears on many postage stamps. While he is usually portrayed bearded, he didn't grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. He was the first of 16 presidents to do so. He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of Nebraska. The United States Navy USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name. Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nation's capital, and is one of the top five visited National Park Service sites in the country. Ford's Theatre, among the top sites in Washington, D.C., is across the street from Petersen House (where he died). Memorials in Springfield, Illinois include Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln's home, as well as his tomb. A portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on Mount Rushmore, which receives about 3 million visitors a year.\n\n The Washington Nationals have a President's Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on Mount Rushmore – George Washington (\"George\"), Thomas Jefferson (\"Tom\"), Abraham Lincoln (\"Abe\"), and Theodore Roosevelt (\"Teddy\") – have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant – William Howard Taft (\"Bill\") – was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. Calvin Coolidge (\"Cal\") was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. Herbert Hoover (\"Herbie\") replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place \n\n great because it removed the knee from the slave's neck, not wicked because it knelt over the slave for centuries'. Former President Trump has been known to share an affinity with Mount Rushmore, even telling South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem that it is a dream of his to have his own face carved onto the monument. In an article done by Steven Groves he reveals that Trump “joked at a campaign rally about getting enshrined alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. And while it was Noem, a Republican, who pushed for a return of fireworks on the eve of Independence Day, Trump committed to visiting South Dakota for the celebration”.\n\n American composer Michael Daugherty's 2010 piece for chorus and orchestra, \"Mount Rushmore,\" depicts each of the four presidents in separate movements. The piece sets texts by George Washington, William Billings, Thomas Jefferson, Maria Cosway, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Alice Cooper references Mount Rushmore in his album DaDa on the song \"I love America\" with the words, \"I love that mountain with those four big heads.\" Adam Young composed a score in based on the shrine called \"Mount Rushmore.\" It was released November 1, 2016.

In the culinary arts, vinegar is primarily used as a flavorful and acidic cooking ingredient. It adds tanginess and brightness to dishes and can be used in marinades, dressings, sauces, and soups. Vinegar is also commonly used in pickling vegetables or fruits, as its acidity helps preserve them.\n\nThere are various types of vinegar available, depending on the source materials used during production. Balsamic vinegar, for example, is made from grape must and is known for its rich flavor and syrupy consistency. Malt vinegar is made from malted barley and has a distinctive malty taste.\n\nIn addition to its culinary uses, vinegar finds applications in other industries as well. Due to its mild acidity, it serves as an effective household cleaner. Its antimicrobial properties make it useful for cleaning surfaces such as countertops or cutting boards. Vinegar can also be utilized in laundry to help remove stains or odors from clothes.\n\nOverall, vinegar's versatility makes it a valuable ingredient both in cooking and various industrial settings.\n\n Vincotto has a sweet flavor, and is not a form of vinegar, though a sweet vinegar version can be produced using a vincotto as a base. This additional product is called a Vinegar of Vincotto, Vincotto vinegar, or Vincotto balsamic and can be used in the same way as a good mellow Balsamic vinegar. Vincotto appears to be related to defrutum and other forms of grape juice boiled down to varying strengths (carenum, sapa) that were produced in Ancient Rome. Defrutum was used to preserve, sweeten, and/or flavor many foods (including wine), by itself or with honey or garum. Defrutum was also consumed as a drink when diluted with water, or fermented into \n\nOne of the most vital minerals for detoxifying the body is potassium, and there is no better source than raw apple cider vinegar.Only vinegar with the \"mother\" can be used as medicine because it has beneficial minerals (especially potassium), malic and tartaric acids, and enzymes intact.Raw vinegars have been used to cure ailments for centuries, not only for specific medical problems, but also to improve one's health, to detoxify the body, and to treat a wide range of diseases related to toxins and acidity. In Asia, vinegar is often called \"the best friend of Chinese herbs\" because it is frequently used to process herbal preparations. It is also successfully used in modern Chinese medicine. The historical origins of vinegar are not exactly known; it was probably discovered when our ancestors saw that wine exposed to the air turned sour, thereby creating vinegar. It is among the oldest of foods and medicines, well known for its healing properties. Raw apple cider vinegar or raw coconut vinegar is famous for treating digestive upsets and is also quite effective for flu/cold, allergies, low immunity, infections, skin diseases, high blood pressure, obesity, acid reflux, diabetes, weight loss, and arthritis. It is one of the most successfully used natural remedies today for detoxifying and healing sickness, not only in humans but in natural veterinarian medicine also. The process of creating this raw apple cider vinegar involves fermenting apple juice to wine or cider, which is then allowed to ferment a second time until the alcohol mixes with oxygen in the air, changing it into acetic acid and water. Apple cider vinegar is often called one of Mother Nature's perfect foods, so it seems fitting that medicinal apple cider vinegar must contain the \"mother,\" a term that refers to the milky sediment at the bottom of the bottle, which should not be confused with commercially made (nonmilky) processed apple cider vinegar, which is only good for taste, pickling, and cleaning. Only vinegar with the \"mother\" can be used as medicine because it has beneficial minerals (especially potassium), malic and tartaric acids, and enzymes intact. One of the most vital minerals for detoxifying the body is potassium, and there is no better source than raw apple cider vinegar.Lemon juice is also acidic to the taste, like apple cider vinegar, and both digest into an alkaline ash, thereby having a strong alkalizing effect on the body.Raw apple cider vinegar acts as a buffer in the body because the acetic acid reacts with base or acid compounds to form an acetate, thereby rendering them chemically bioavailable for the body's utilization.\n\n Japanese rice vinegar (米酢 komezu, \"rice vinegar\" or simply 酢 su, \"vinegar\") is very mild and mellow (Western - e.g., US or UK - vinegars are approximately 5% acetic acid) and ranges in color from colorless to pale yellow. It is made from either rice or sake lees. These are more specifically called yonezu (米酢 よねず) and kasuzu (粕酢 かすず), respectively. These vinegars are used in making sunomono (酢の物, \"vinegar dishes\"), tsukemono (漬物, \"pickles\"), nimono (煮物, \"simmered dishes\"), as well as in marinades to mitigate the stronger odors of certain fishes and meats. Seasoned rice vinegar (合わせ酢 awasezu) is made by adding sake, salt and sugar. Additionally, mirin is also sometimes used (but only rarely). Although it can be made at home, prepared awasezu can also be readily bought at supermarkets. Seasoned rice vinegar is added to cooked rice to be used in making \n\n contexts and also found popularity in the kitchen and medicinal spheres. The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar.

The match was declared a 0–0 draw. As New Zealand and Australia had already qualified for the World Cup, Samoa and Fiji met in the playoff match with the winner gaining qualification to the World Cup and the loser to play against the winner of a match between Tonga and Papua New Guinea to earn a place in the repechage tournament. As a result, Fiji qualified for the World Cup, while Samoa awaited the winner of Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Tonga played Samoa to determine who advanced to the repechage tournament. As a result, Samoa became the first team to qualify for the repechage tournament.\n\n This page details American Samoa national football team records and statistics; the most capped players, the players with the most goals and American Samoa's match record by opponent. American Samoa played their first full international match against Papua New Guinea, which ended in a 20–0 loss. Their national team have suffered the world's biggest international defeat, by losing to Australia 31–0. American Samoa have only won against Cook Islands and Tonga. American Samoa have by far lost to all of these teams at least once.\n\nNotes The OFC Nations Cup has often acted as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification process for Oceanian national teams and, as a result, American Samoa have competed in the qualifiers for both competitions in every edition since 1998. They have yet to qualify for either competition. \n\n American Samoa is one of the weakest teams in the world, due to both its small population base and the overwhelming popularity of American football, basketball and baseball in the islands. In fact, it holds the distinction of suffering the largest loss in international football history, having been defeated by Australia 31–0 on April 11, 2001. American Samoa has never won a FIFA-sanctioned match. The team has only recorded one victory in its history over Wallis and Futuna Islands in 1983 (3-0), when both teams were not yet members of FIFA (Wallis and Futuna Islands still is not). As of December 2010 according to the FIFA World Rankings, American Samoa are ranked 203rd, or joint last, in the world of FIFA-sanctioned, international football. In November 2011, American Samoa defeated Tonga 2–1 in the first round of OFC World Cup Qualification to record their second international victory after 38 consecutive defeats.\n\n Lui was in charge of American Samoa in the 31–0 loss against Australia in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup. Tunoa Lui, who was appointed only a year before, left on the 30th of July, 2001. The American Samoa national team was then without a coach for two years before the appointment of Ian Crook in 2003. He later coached Samoa's football team for the Oceania Cup.\n\nQuestion: Which team beat American Samoa 31-0 in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup, but still failed to qualify?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On the way, he inadvertently pulls the legendary Spork, named Ratscalibur, from the legendary Scone, and is hailed as the prophesied hero. Subsequently, he is expected to go on a quest to save the rats from the wicked wizard Salaman, if he is to be restored to his human form.\n\n animals become aware of the rats' renewed presence in the Hollow, they launch an attack on them and drive them out of their corner of the reserve. However, several more rats gather at the pond and attack the frogs, but Toad voices his protest and the rats attack him too.

A “large decline in pregnancy rates” was detected when the effort was put forth to figure out another possible cause for the decline in population size. This is also supported by the fact that most calves up to six months old are sufficiently protected by their mother and the herd and are not killed by predators. This was shown in one study, where newborn calves were radio-collared and by six months of age they were still alive and healthy. Since the \n\n 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls. After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression is more common in crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do \n\n Gestation lasts roughly six months, ending in parturition, which normally occurs during June or July. Typically, females give birth to one or two young. The newborns weigh about 500 g, and have spots. The young are cared for by their mother after birth for several months, until weaning occurs. This process generally takes between three and four months. At six months, the young have typically reached full adult size. Sexual maturity, however, does not occur until roughly 18 months. Not much is known about black musk deer parental care. Females are generally the main caretakers, as they watch their young for roughly 3 to 4 months. Typically, the young travel with their mothers throughout this period, during which the mother defends and grooms her young. The role of the father in parental care is currently unknown.\n\n The uterine horns open into the vagina through separate vaginal canals, forming a uterus duplex. The placenta also lacks a hemophagous area, a structure which aids in endocytosis and digestion of erythrocytes. The gestation period varies depending on climate, lasting 2–3 months in tropical areas, while lasting up to 5 months in temperate climates. At birth, this species weighs about 50% of the mother’s weight. The females fly, carrying their young, between roosts to keep them safe from predators.\n\n Females give birth to litters containing two to five young around early spring. Mating takes place in short periods throughout the rainy season in December. Afterwards, both males and females go their separate ways and return to their solitary lives once more. Young are raised solely by the females. Gestation lasts around two months (63 days). Weaning takes place between 45 and 60 days, with the young reaching full maturity around one year of age.\n\nQuestion: Which animal has the longest gestation period at around 22 months?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity. Biodiversity may also be affected by ecosystem engineer's ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater species richness and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Coral-reef habitats, created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.\n\n ice on the lodge. Beavers in some areas will dig canals connected to their ponds. The canals fill up with groundwater and increase accessibility of river resources, facilitate transport of acquired resources, and lessen the risk of predation. These canals can stretch up to 1 m wide, 0.5 m deep and over 0.5 km long. It has been hypothesized that beavers' canals are not only transportation routes but an extension of their \"central place\" around the lodge and/or food cache. Beavers create trails or \"slides\" as they drag wood, which then make it easier for the animals to transport new material.\n\n bark, aquatic plants, grasses and sedges. Beavers build dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks and mud; they chew down trees for building material. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Their infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other organisms in the ecosystem, they are considered a keystone species. Adult males and females live in monogamous pairs with their offspring. When they are old enough, the young will help their parents repair dams and lodges and may also help raise newly born offspring. Beavers hold territories and mark them using scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum, a \n\n successful and the aquatic herbivorous mammal was spotted in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beginning in 1968. Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows.\n\n  Beavers live in freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. Water is the most important part of the beaver habitat. They require a year-round supply for swimming, diving, floating logs, protection of lodge entrances and safety from land-dwelling predators. Beavers prefer to use slower moving streams, typically with a gradient or steepness of one percent, though they have been recorded using streams with gradients as high as 15 percent. Beavers also prefer wider streams over narrower ones. They typically avoid areas with regular flooding and may abandon a location for years after a significant flood. Beavers prefer areas with flatter terrain and diverse vegetation close to the water. North American beavers colonize an area where trees are around 60 m from the water but can harvest trees several hundred meters away. \n\nQuestion: What name is given to the home of a beaver?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The males compete for females during the breeding season. During these \"boxing\" contests, they lock arms and try to push each other over. Usually, only the dominant male in the group mates. The gestation period is 30–31 days, after which the incompletely developed fetus (referred to as a joey) attaches to the teat in the pouch for 130–150 days. Females sexually mature at 17 months while males mature at around 20 months. The western grey kangaroo is closely related to the eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus), and their distribution overlaps extensively, especially in the Murray–Darling basin. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although hybridisation occurs in both directions in the overlap zone between the two species in the wild, this does not seem to be the case with captive animals. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male western grey kangaroo. This is an example of unidirectional hybridisation.\n\n is 150 mm. At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.\n\n In the early 2000s, while working as a tour guide running tours between Alice Springs and Uluru, Barns came across a joey, still in its dead mother's pouch, near Curtin Springs. The kangaroo mother, who had been hit by a car, had been dead for some time; with the help of a nurse on the tour, Barns managed to free the 4-month-old joey. The tour group named it Anna (later renamed Palau). This experience made Barns angry about how many vehicles had already driven past the dead mother and not thought to check that she may have a joey. He decided that it would be his mission to tell people about how to check for this. Following this, in 2005, Barns started the first incarnation of the Kangaroo Sanctuary, the Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre, and many joeys started getting sent to him, mostly through a combination of road \n\n As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. Depending on the area, the mating season can take place anywhere between April and December. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The oestrous cycle of ringtail possum lasts 28 days. It is both polyoestrous and polyovular. If a female prematurely loses her litter, she can return to oestrous and produce a second litter in October as a replacement if conditions are right. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets. Common ringtail possum young tend to grow relatively slowly due to dilute milk with low lipid levels that is provided to the young. As with other marsupials, the common ringtail possum's \n\n The smallest marsupial is the long-tailed planigale from Australia.

Their leader is a handsome white-haired stallion named White Mane (Crin Blanc in French). A group of ranchers capture the wild stallion and place him in a corral. Yet White Mane escapes. A boy named Folco (Alain Emery), who lives with his fisherman grandfather, watches intently as White Mane escapes, and he dreams of one day handling White Mane. The ranchers once again try to capture White Mane and fail. Folco asks the men if he can have the white horse. Yes, says one of the men, \"but first you have to catch him, but your fish will grow wings before you can manage that.\" Later Folco comes across White Mane in the marshes, and he tries to rope him.

His father and uncle were both horse trainers in his native India, though he was encouraged to stay away from the track and get an education instead of following his family's profession. Once in the United States, he bought his first interest in a Thoroughbred in 1996. Reflecting his patriotism, his racing colors are designed with U.S. stars and stripes-themed red, white and blue. He first raced horses on a small scale in Maryland with trainer Jimmy Murphy, and later with Dale Capuano.

Khumba ventures beyond the fence and encounters an opportunistic African wild dog named Skalk who nearly leads him to his doom when Skalk's pack try to eat him. He is saved by a maternal wildebeest named Mama V and a flamboyant British ostrich named Bradley. Mama \n\n is a given name for girls in Zimbabwe. Zebras have also been represented in Western culture. They have been thought of as a more exotic alternative to horse; the comic book character Sheena, Queen of the Jungle is depicted riding a zebra. The film Racing Stripes features a captive zebra ostracised from the horses and end up being ridden by a rebellious girl. In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.

Rejected by his publishers, he sets out to write a new book, and publish it himself, to restore his finances. Seeing inspiration around London, most notably a rich man's funeral that is largely unattended and a mean-spirited old man who gives him the catchphrase \"Humbug\" and inspiration of a new character, he begins writing A Christmas Carol, due in six weeks in order to be published by Christmas, despite his friends and publishers telling him that the \n\n for Christmas dinner, donates money to the gay center, spends a Christmas dinner with Freda and Mary, gives his employees bonuses, promotes Bob as a business partner, gives Bob a pay raise, and accepts Bob's health care proposal.

Then Scrooge sobs and promises that he will change while he is transported back to his home on the present Christmas Day. Happy to return, Scrooge remembers putting away Bill's letter, written on the day of their breakup, and then reads it, saying that when Ben finds grace, Bill forgives him and declares his love for him. On the afternoon, Scrooge anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit \n\n Nevertheless, Scrooge's attitude soon changes after a fateful night wherein three ghosts also visit him and take him through his past and present, and show him what his future would be like if he does not change. Scrooge sees a younger caricature of himself, voiced by Robert Morse and realizes how greedy and miserly he has become. The Ghost of Christmas Present (performed by Paul Frees) proceeds to take Scrooge to the home of his diligent employee Bob Cratchit and discovers just how much poverty Cratchit and his family wallow in.

Upon release, critics gave generally positive reviews for Holly & Ivy, praising its composition and Cole's interpretations of the covered material. The album was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 20, 1996 for 500,000 sales shipments; it peaked at number 36 on the Billboard 200 chart. Holly & Ivy spawned one single \"No More Blue Christmas\". In support of the album, Cole filmed a television special, \"Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas\", at State University of New York Performing Arts Center in Purchase, New York; it premiered on WNET on December 7, 1994.\n\n \"The Holly and the Ivy\" is a traditional British folk Christmas carol, listed as number 514 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times. The lyrics and melody varied significantly in traditional communities, but the song has since become standardised. The version which is now popular was collected in 1909 by the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp in the market town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, from a woman named Mary Clayton.\n\n Milton for Christmas Day. It is called the \"Holly and the Ivy.\"\" The words of the carol were included in Sylvester's 1861 collection A Garland of Christmas Carols where it is claimed to originate from \"an old broadside, printed a century and a half since\" [i.e. around 1711]: Husk's 1864 Songs of the Nativity also includes the carol, stating: \"This carol appears to have nearly escaped the notice of collectors, as it has been reprinted by one alone, who states his copy to have been taken from \"an old broadside, printed a century and a half since,\" i.e. about 1710. It is still retained on the broadsides printed at Birmingham.\" Early English Lyrics by Chambers and Sidgwick, published in 1907, repeats Husk's statement.\n\nQuestion: Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For all players who have played for Portugal, see. As of October 2021, 116 players have reached this milestone for Portugal. The record for the most caps is held by Cristiano Ronaldo, with 182 caps since 2003; he overtook Luís Figo's record of 127 caps in June 2016. The only other players with a century of caps are Fernando Couto, Nani, João Moutinho, Pepe and Rui Patrício; Patrício is also the most capped Portuguese goalkeeper, with 100 international matches played since 2010. The first player to reach 25 caps was Xico, in his final appearance on 17 June 1951. The most recent player to gain their 25th cap was Rúben Neves, on 12 October 2021.\n\n Some men's association football teams still awards physical caps. Players are awarded one cap for every match they play — unless they play in a World Cup or European Championship finals tournament, then they are given a single cap for the competition, with the names of all their opponents stitched into the fabric of the cap itself. For example, when David Beckham made his one-hundredth appearance for England, because a number of his appearances had been at World Cup and European Championship final tournaments for which he could only receive one cap, he received only his 85th physical cap. In Scotland, for many years the practice was to present caps only for appearances in the British Home Championship, meaning that several players never received one (including those in their 1958 FIFA World Cup squad); this anomaly was rectified retrospectively in the 2000s after pressure from players' families. FIFA recognises certain international games as ones where a player can be awarded a cap - these games are regarded as International “A” games. These are matches in which both nations field their first Representative Team.\n\n also voted in eighth place for the FIFA Player of the Century award, and was selected for the World Team of the 20th Century. Ten German players were named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by former footballer Pelé, and ten are in the FIFA Century Club, having earned 100 or more caps. Lothar Matthäus's 150 international appearances make him the ninth-most capped player in world football, and Miroslav Klose's 71 goals is the eleventh-most of any international player.

According to Evans' diaries, he helped to compose songs for the Sgt. Pepper album. He wrote, on 27 January 1967: \"Sgt Pepper.

The final performance at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall was released on their album 801 Live. Author and musician Alan Clayson cites 801's adoption of the track as evidence that the Beatles' musical influence remained strong among 1970s glam rock artists, and that the latter scene lacked the generational divisiveness that would soon characterise punk rock. Dave Swanson of Ultimate Classic Rock ranks 801's version at number 6 in his list of the \"10 Most Unique Beatles Cover Versions\", saying that the band transform the song in an arrangement that features \"Funky bass lines, squabbling synths and the guitar dynamics of Manzanera\". ; Phil Collins released a version on his 1981 album Face Value as a tribute to John Lennon, who was killed at the time Collins was recording the album. ; In 2007, Oasis set \"Within You Without You\" to the music of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as their contribution to the BBC's 40th anniversary tribute to the Beatles' Sgt.

(We All Shine On)\") is a song by English rock musician John Lennon, released as a single on Apple Records in February 1970. The lyric focuses on a concept in which the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. The single was credited to \"Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band\", apart from in the US, where the credit was \"John Ono Lennon\". The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts, competing with the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" in the US, where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million \n\n set a romantic tone on the verses\". \"Old Me\" lyrically reflects on past mistakes, and is a high-energy \"dance anthem\". \"Easier\" is a synth-heavy new wave song, released as the album's lead single, with conversational tone and \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. Second single \"Teeth\", is a grungy, rock-tinged song, with an energetic, catchy chorus. \"Wildflower\" is a soft rock song with a gospel-like vocal intro. \"Best Years\" moves at a slower pace, albeit containing a \"danceable vibe\". The piano-led \"Lover of Mine\" features intertwining guitar strumming patterns and \"powerful vocal styles\". \"Thin White Lies\" is an \"angst-ridden\" dance-esque track, with \"strong electric beats\". The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflective \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album.\n\n \"I Me Mine\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1970 album Let It Be. Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles. The musical arrangement alternates between waltz-time verses and \n\n The song tells of the wedding of two teenagers and their lifestyle afterward. Living in a modest apartment furnished with items bought on sale at Sears, Roebuck and Co., including a \"coolerator\" (refrigerator), the young man finds work and they begin to enjoy relative prosperity. Eventually they purchase a \"souped-up jitney\" (an automobile modified for high performance) and travel to New Orleans, where their wedding had taken place, to celebrate their anniversary. Each verse ends with the refrain, \"'C'est la vie,' say the old folks, 'it goes to show you never can tell.'\" The piano melody was influenced by Mitchell Torok's 1953 hit \"Caribbean\".\n\n \"I Want to Tell You\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1966 album Revolver. It was written and sung by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. After \"Taxman\" and \"Love You To\", it was the third Harrison composition recorded for Revolver. Its inclusion on the LP marked the first time that he was allocated more than two songs on a Beatles album, a reflection of his continued growth as a songwriter beside John Lennon and Paul McCartney. When writing \"I Want to Tell You\", Harrison drew inspiration from his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed \"the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit\".

Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film, he won four Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and twenty Grammy Awards, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His works include the theme and soundtrack for the Peter Gunn television series as well as the music for The Pink Panther film series (\"The Pink Panther Theme\") and \"Moon River\" from Breakfast at Tiffany's. The Music from Peter Gunn won the inaugural Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Mancini enjoyed a long collaboration composing film scores for the film director Blake Edwards. Mancini also scored a No. 1 hit single during the rock era on the Hot 100: his arrangement and recording of the \"Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet\" spent two weeks at the top, starting with the week ending June 28, 1969.\n\n The Pink Panther is an American media franchise primarily focusing on a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963. The role of Clouseau was originated by and is most closely associated with, Peter Sellers. Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini. Elements and characters inspired by the films were adapted into other media, including books, comic books, video games and animated series. The first film in the series derives its name from a pink diamond that has enormous size and value. The diamond is called the \"Pink Panther\" because the flaw at its center, when viewed closely, is said to resemble a leaping pink panther. The phrase reappears in the title of the fourth film \n\nBest Instrumental Composition (other than jazz) ; Henry Mancini (composer) for \"The Pink Panther Theme\" ; [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Show]] ; Richard M.

Penelope is a black and white cat, who often finds herself with a white stripe down her back, whether painted intentionally or by accident. She often finds herself being chased by the overly enthusiastic Pepé, but when the occasion has presented itself, Penelope has been portrayed as the pursuer. For Scent-imental Reasons, Little Beau Pepé, and Really Scent have all shown Penelope to harbor an attraction to Pepé whenever his scent is neutralized (though in each cited instance, extenuating circumstances have caused Pepé to become repulsed by her, inciting Penelope to reverse the roles). In current Warner Bros. merchandise, Penelope and Pepé are portrayed as sharing a mutual attraction towards each other, whereas the Looney Tunes comic book series maintains their chasing relationship. Carrotblanca featured her as the Ilsa analogue \n\n considered Tom and Jerry \"the best of enemies\", whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual caring and respect for one another. Jerry is also mute, along with Tom. In later Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jerry acquired a young ward: a small grey mouse called \"Tuffy\" or \"Nibbles\" depending upon the cartoon, who was left on Jerry's doorstep as a foundling baby in the 1946 short The Milky Waif. Jerry and Tuffy were also featured together in a sub-series of Tom and Jerry cartoons set in 17th century France which featured the characters as musketeers.

The character did not originally have a permanent name; she was alternately referred to as 'Penelope', 'Fifi' and 'Fabrette', and animator Chuck Jones' 1960 model sheet simply calls her 'Le Cat'. The name 'Penelope Pussycat' was created retroactively for Warner Bros. marketing. The character first appeared in the 1949 short For Scent-imental Reasons, which won an Academy Award.

Callaghan is the only person to have held all four Great Offices of State, having served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1964 to 1967, Home Secretary from 1967 to 1970 and Foreign Secretary from 1974 to 1976. He was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1945 to 1987. Born into a working class family in Portsmouth, Callaghan left school early and began his career as a \n\n Callaghan was the only prime minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions—chancellor of the Exchequer, home secretary and foreign secretary—prior to becoming prime minister. During his first year in office, Callaghan started what has since become known as 'The Great Debate', when he spoke at Ruskin College, Oxford, about the 'legitimate concerns' of the public about the quality of education in the nation's maintained schools. This discussion led to greater involvement of the government, through its ministries, in the curriculum and administration of state education, leading to the eventual introduction of the National Curriculum some ten years later. Early in his premiership he caused controversy with the appointment of Peter Jay, his then son-in-law as the British Ambassador \n\n The resignation of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister came on 22 November 1990, more than 11 years after she had first been elected. Former Cabinet minister Michael Heseltine had challenged her leadership earlier in November and although she fared better than him in the leadership contest, she was unable to gain an outright win and handed in her resignation, paving the way for a new Conservative leader more likely to win the next general election which was due within 18 months. The announcement of the Community Charge (often referred to as the Poll Tax) during 1989 and the onset of a recession shortly before Thatcher's resignation had seen Tory support plunge in the opinion polls, most of which were showing a double-digit Labour lead and making it seem likely that Neil Kinnock would be the next Prime Minister. Conservative MPs elected Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major as their new leader on 27 November 1990, and he was invited by the Queen to form a majority government the following day.\n\n Winston Churchill was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and served until 1929, presenting five budgets. He was initially sceptical about advice from the Bank of England and leading economists to implement a return to the gold standard. In April 1925, however, he agreed to include the measure in his first budget. It resulted in deflation and unemployment, and was a catalyst to the miners' strike that led to the General Strike of 1926. Churchill's other policies as Chancellor included free trade, a reduction in the rate of local taxation, lowering the pension age and support for coal miners and the mining industry.\n\n Discontent with Thatcher's leadership of the party had been growing over the latter years of her tenure. There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the European Economic Community. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him Deputy Prime Minister (in theory a promotion but in \n\nQuestion: During Margaret Thatcher's years as Prime Minister, there were three Chancellors of the Exchequer.

A rock and roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens was killed in a plane crash eight months into his music career. Valens had several hits, most notably \"La Bamba\", which he had adapted from a Mexican folk song. Valens transformed the song into one with a rock rhythm and beat, and it became a hit in 1958, making Valens a pioneer of the Spanish-speaking rock and roll movement. He also had an American number-two hit with \"Donna\". On February 3, 1959, on what has become known as \"The Day the Music Died\", Valens died in a plane crash in Iowa, an accident that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J.

Valens was on the plane because he won a coin toss with Holly's backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Holly's bassist, Waylon Jennings, voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to J.P. Richardson, who was ill with the flu. Around 12:55 am on February 3, 1959, the three-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza departed for Fargo, North Dakota, and crashed a few minutes after takeoff for reasons still unknown. The crash killed all three passengers and pilot Roger Peterson instantly upon impact. As with Holly and Richardson, Valens suffered massive and unsurvivable head injuries along with blunt-force trauma to the chest. At just 17 years old, Valens was the youngest to die in the crash. The tragedy inspired singer Don McLean to write his 1971 hit \"American Pie\", immortalizing February 3 as \"The Day the Music Died\". Valens's remains were buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California.\n\n fellow rock 'n' rollers Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson, perished two years later in an airplane crash when their chartered Beechcraft Bonanza crashed near Mason City, Iowa, in the early morning hours of February 3, 1959. The crash (1957 Pacoima mid-air collision) was discussed on the May 19, 1957, episode of The CBS Radio Workshop (entitled \"Heaven Is In the Sky\"). The program described when and how both planes took off from their respective airfields, and included discussion of how the Pacoima Junior High School was having the 7th grade students outside for exercise. It also included interviews with people who were witnesses and/or affected by the crash.\n\n On February 3, 1959, American rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and \"The Big Bopper\" J.

The suborder is part of the order Chiroptera (bats), and contains a single family, Pteropodidae. The family is divided into between two and six subfamilies, with recent phylogenetic analysis suggesting a different classification structure of the known species than before. Bats have been traditionally thought to be a monophyletic group; according to this model, all living fruit bats and microbats (Microchiroptera) are descendants of a common ancestor species that was already capable of flight. However, there are alternate hypotheses which conclude that bats are polyphyletic. The \n\n primate hypothesis was created in the 1980s stating that, based on morphological evidence, the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera, although genetic evidence supports the monophyly of bats. This model states that fruit bats and primates share several anatomical features not seen in microbats, and are thus more closely related; for example, their brains show a number of advanced characteristics that link them to primates. The Yinpterochiroptera is a proposed suborder of the Chiroptera based on molecular evidence consisting of the fruit bats and five other microbat families: Rhinopomatidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, and Megadermatidae. This model also challenges the view that the Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera are monophyletic. The other suborder consisting of the other bat species would be the Yangochiroptera.\n\n Red fruit bats are frugivores. They primarily feed on fruit like Cecropia schrebriana, Manilkara bidentata, and Prestoea montana. It has been shown that they can also survive on mangos, fruit nectars, and bananas, but they need to have the flesh of the fruit exposed for the animal to eat it.\n\n species, indicating the recent divergence of these species. Many species are having edible fruits. Some birds and bats that are specialised frugivores tend to eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, which functions for Biological dispersal. Others swallow the fruit and pass the seed intact through the gut. An incomplete list of birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diet include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan. The fruits are an important food source for Palaeognathae highly dependent.

The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk.\n\nIn most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function.\n\nGalactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production. This stage requires prolactin. Oxytocin is critical for the milk let-down reflex in response to suckling. Galactorrhea is milk production unrelated to nursing. It can occur in males and females of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances such as hyperprolactinaemia.\n\nPurpose\nThe chief function of a lactation is to provide nutrition and immune protection to the young after birth. Due to lactation, the mother-young pair can survive even if food is scarce or too hard for the young to attain, expanding the environmental conditions the species can withstand. The costly investment of energy and resources into milk is outweighed by the benefit to offspring survival.  In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring.\n\nHuman\n\nHormonal influences\nFrom the eighteenth week of pregnancy (the second and third trimesters), a woman's body produces hormones that stimulate the growth of the milk duct system in the breasts:\n\nProgesterone influences the growth in size of alveoli and lobes; high levels of progesterone inhibit lactation before birth. Progesterone levels drop after birth; this triggers the onset of copious milk production.\nEstrogen stimulates the milk duct system to grow and differentiate. Like progesterone, high levels of estrogen also inhibit lactation. Estrogen levels also drop at delivery and remain low for the first several months of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid estrogen-based birth control methods, as a spike in estrogen levels may reduce a mother's milk supply.\nProlactin contributes to the increased growth and differentiation of the alveoli, and also influences differentiation of ductal structures. High levels of prolactin during pregnancy and breastfeeding also increase insulin resistance, increase growth factor levels (IGF-1) and modify lipid metabolism in preparation for breastfeeding. During lactation, prolactin is the main factor maintaining tight junctions of the ductal epithelium and regulating milk production through osmotic balance.\nHuman placental lactogen (HPL) – from the second month of pregnancy, the placenta releases large amounts of HPL. This hormone is closely associated with prolactin and appears to be instrumental in breast, nipple, and areola growth before birth.\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), through control of estrogen and progesterone production, and also, by extension, prolactin and growth hormone production, are essential.\nGrowth hormone (GH) is structurally very similar to prolactin and independently contributes to its galactopoiesis.\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids such as cortisol have an important lactation inducing function in several animal species, including humans. Glucocorticoids play a complex regulating role in the maintenance of tight junctions.\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) are very important galactopoietic hormones whose levels are naturally increased during pregnancy.\nOxytocin contracts the smooth muscle of the uterus during and after birth, and during orgasm(s). After birth, oxytocin contracts the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly produced milk into the duct system. Oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex, or let-down, in response to suckling, to occur.\n\nIt is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy through combinations of birth control pills, galactagogues, and milk expression using a breast pump.\n\nSecretory differentiation\nDuring the latter part of pregnancy, the woman's breasts enter into the Secretory Differentiation stage. This is when the breasts make colostrum (see below), a thick, sometimes yellowish fluid. At this stage, high levels of progesterone inhibit most milk production. It is not a medical concern if a pregnant woman leaks any colostrum before her baby's birth, nor is it an indication of future milk production.\n\nSecretory activation\nAt birth, prolactin levels remain high, while the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone, estrogen, and HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels stimulates the copious milk production of Secretory Activation.\n\nWhen the breast is stimulated, prolactin levels in the blood rise, peak in about 45 minutes, and return to the pre-breastfeeding state about three hours later. The release of prolactin triggers the cells in the alveoli to make milk. Prolactin also transfers to the breast milk. Some research indicates that prolactin in milk is greater at times of higher milk production, and lower when breasts are fuller, and that the highest levels tend to occur between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nOther hormones—notably insulin, thyroxine, and cortisol—are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Secretory Activation begins about 30–40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk \"coming in the breast\") until 50–73 hours (2–3 days) after birth.\n\nColostrum is the first milk a breastfed baby receives. It contains higher amounts of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and is especially high in immunoglobulin A (IgA), which coats the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and helps to prevent pathogens from invading the baby's system. Secretory IgA also helps prevent food allergies. Over the first two weeks after the birth, colostrum production slowly gives way to mature breast milk.\n\nAutocrine control - Galactopoiesis\nThe hormonal endocrine control system drives milk production during pregnancy and the first few days after the birth. When the milk supply is more firmly established, autocrine (or local) control system begins.\n\nDuring this stage, the more that milk is removed from the breasts, the more the breast will produce milk. Research also suggests that draining the breasts more fully also increases the rate of milk production. Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Low supply can often be traced to:\n not feeding or pumping often enough\n inability of the infant to transfer milk effectively caused by, among other things:\n jaw or mouth structure deficits\n poor latching technique\n rare maternal endocrine disorders\n hypoplastic breast tissue\n inadequate calorie intake or malnutrition of the mother\n\nMilk ejection reflex\n\nThis is the mechanism by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple. Suckling by the baby stimulates the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which signals to the posterior pituitary gland to produce oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli, which already hold milk. The increased pressure causes milk to flow through the duct system and be released through the nipple. This response can be conditioned e.g. to the cry of the baby.\n\nMilk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Once a woman is conditioned to nursing, let-down can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including the sound of any baby. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. However, this and other problems often settle after two weeks of feeding. Stress or anxiety can cause difficulties with breastfeeding. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the milk ejection or let-down reflex. Oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Some feel a slight tingling, others feel immense amounts of pressure or slight pain/discomfort, and still others do not feel anything different.\n\nA poor milk ejection reflex can be due to sore or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, a history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma. If a mother has trouble breastfeeding, different methods of assisting the milk ejection reflex may help. These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower.\n\nMilk ejection reflex mechanism\nThis is the mechanism by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region. The electrical impulse follows the spinothalamic tract, which begins by innervation of fourth intercostal nerves. The electrical impulse then ascends the posterolateral tract for one or two vertebral levels and synapses with second-order neurons, called tract cells, in the posterior dorsal horn. The tract cells then decussate via the anterior white commissure to the anterolateral corner and ascend to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus, where they synapse with oxytocinergic third-order neurons. The somas of these neurons are located in the hypothalamus, but their axon and axon terminals are located in the infundibulum and pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary, respectively. The oxytocin is produced in the neuron's soma in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is then transported down the infundibulum via the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract with the help of the carrier protein, neurophysin I, to the pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary, and then stored in Herring bodies, where they are stored until the synapse between second- and third-order neurons.\n\nFollowing the electrical impulse, oxytocin is released into the bloodstream. Through the bloodstream, oxytocin makes its way to myoepithelial cells, which lie between the extracellular matrix and luminal epithelial cells that also make up the alveoli in breast tissue. When oxytocin binds to the myoepithelial cells, the cells contract. The increased intra-aveolar pressure forces milk into the lactiferous sinuses, into the lactiferous ducts (a study found that lactiferous sinuses may not exist. If this is true then milk simply enters the lactiferous ducts), and then out the nipple.\n\nAfterpains\nA surge of oxytocin also causes the uterus to contract. During breastfeeding, mothers may feel these contractions as afterpains. These may range from period-like cramps to strong labour-like contractions and can be more severe with second and subsequent babies.\n\nWithout pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation\nIn humans, induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in some cultures, and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers. It appears plausible that the possibility of lactation in women (or females of other species) who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage, especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds. The phenomenon has been also observed in most primates, in some lemurs, and in dwarf mongooses.\n\nLactation can be induced in humans by a combination of physical and psychological stimulation, by drugs, or by a combination of those methods. Several protocols for inducing lactation were developed by Dr. Jack Newman and Lenore Goldfarb and are commonly called the Newman-Goldfarb protocols. The \"regular protocol\" involves the use of birth control pills to mimic the hormone levels of pregnancy with domperidone to stimulate milk production, followed by discontinuing the birth control and the introducing use of a double electric breast pump to induce milk production. Additional protocols exist to support an accelerated timeline and to support induced lactation in menopausal parents.\n\nSome couples may stimulate lactation outside of pregnancy for sexual purposes.\n\nRare accounts of male lactation (as distinct from galactorrhea) exist in historical medical and anthropological literature, although the phenomenon has not been confirmed by more recent literature.\n\nDomperidone is a drug that can induce lactation.\n\nEvolution \n\nCharles Darwin recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands, and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in brood pouches of fish, where they would provide nourishment for eggs. The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids. \n\nAs all mammals lactate, lactation must have evolved before the last common ancestor of all mammals, which places it at a minimum in the Middle or Late Triassic when monotremes diverged from therians. O. T. Oftedal has argued that therapsids evolved a proto-lacteal fluid in order to keep eggs moist, an adaption necessitated due to diapsids parchment shelled eggs which are more vulnerable to evaporation and dehydration than the mineralized eggs produced by some sauropsids. This protolacteal fluid became a complex, nutrient-rich milk which then allowed a decline in egg size by reducing the dependence on a large yolk in the egg.[20] The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth.\n\nDuring early evolution of lactation, the secretion of milk was through pilosebaceous glands on mammary patches, analogous to the areola, and hairs on this patch transported the nourishing fluids to the hatchlings as is seen in monotremes. The development of the nipple occurred in the mammal lineages that diverged after monotremes, metatheria and eutheria.\n\nOccurrence outside Mammalia\n\nAnother well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of columbiform birds. Like in mammals, this also appears to be directed by prolactin. Other birds such as flamingos and penguins utilize similar feeding techniques.\n\nThe discus fish (Symphysodon) is known for (biparentally) feeding their offspring by epidermal mucus secretion. A closer examination reveals that, as in mammals and birds, the secretion of this nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin. Similar behavior is seen in at least 30 species of cichlids.\n\nLactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tsetse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus. The cockroach species Diploptera punctata is also known to feed their offspring by milky secretions.\n\nToxeus magnus, an ant-mimicking jumping spider species of Southeast Asia, also lactates. It nurses its offspring for about 38 days, although they are able to forage on their own after 21 days. Blocking nursing immediately after birth resulted in complete mortality of the offspring, whereas blocking it 20 days after birth resulted in increased foraging and reduced survival. This form of lactation may have evolved from production of trophic eggs.\n\nSee also\n Lactation room\n Galactogogue\n Milk line\n Male lactation\n Udder\n Breastfeeding\n Lactation failure\n Lactation suppression\n Erotic lactation\n Hypothalamic–pituitary–prolactin axis\n Roman charity\n Pregnancy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHow mammals lost their egg yolks—Did mammals develop nutritional milk before or after they abandoned yolky eggs?

The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk.\n\nIn most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function.\n\nGalactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production.

Kangaroos and opossums are marsupials, found in Australia and the Americas, in which the newborn continue to develop outside the womb in a marsupium (pouch). Ninety percent of all mammals are placental (eutherians), in which the fetus is carried in the womb until birth at which time it is at an advanced stage of development. In 2013, a shrew-size Chinese fossil was found, named _Juramaia sinensis_ , which, at 160 million years, is thought to be the oldest placental mammal. Humans are placental mammals classified as **primates**. Mammals have a number of unique characteristics not shared by other vertebrates: Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk, the offspring's primary source of nutrition. (In 1758, Linnaeus named these animals _mammals_ , from the Latin = \"breast.\") Hair or fur, present at some time during life, protects mammals against extreme cold. The middle ear contains three bones that transmit sound vibrations into nerve impulses. The lower mammalian jaw consists of only a single bone on each side. Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). This 1937 poster promoted infant nursing.Since then, the practice has increased, and experts recommend it for at least the first six months of infant life.# Birds\n\n**Charles Darwin** (1809–1882)\n\n# c. 150 Million BCE\n\nThere are some 10,000 species of living birds on all continents that have the common characteristics of being feathered, winged, bipedal, warm-blooded, and egg-laying.\n\n Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.\n\nPlacental mammals have several unique characteristics that set them apart from other vertebrates. One distinguishing feature is the presence of mammary glands, which are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk. This milk serves as the primary source of nutrition for the offspring. Another unique characteristic of placental mammals is the presence of hair or fur, which helps protect them against extreme cold.\n\nPlacental mammals also have a middle ear that contains three bones, allowing them to transmit sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Unlike other vertebrates, placental mammals have a lower jaw consisting of only a single bone on each side. Additionally, placental mammals are warm-blooded (endothermic) and have specialized or differentiated teeth. They possess a larger brain, particularly the neocortex, which is the most advanced brain area. Placental mammals also have a diaphragm, a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity, and an efficient four-chambered heart.\n\nIt is worth noting that humans, as primates, are classified as placental mammals. These unique characteristics collectively contribute to the successful adaptation and diversity of placental mammals.\n\nQuestion: Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The majority of Neruda's poetry, as individual books or collections of selected poems, as well as his memoirs, are widely available in English, however Mistral's works are harder to find, though collected editions are available. Contemporary Chilean authors have earned an international reputation in the literary world. The most famous is novelist Isabel Allende, whose House of the Spirits, Of Love and Shadows, and Eva Luna have all been international bestsellers. She is the niece of president Salvador Allende. The increasingly popular Luis Sepúlveda wrote stylish short novels like The Old Man Who Read Love Stories, and combined travel writing with imaginative fiction in Full Circle: a South American Journey. José Donoso's novel Curfew recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while Antonio Skármeta's novel Burning Patience (drawing on Neruda's life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, Il Postino (The Postman).\n\n In 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous Chilean poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman like his father.

His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory \n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz made significant contributions to both physics and society. In the field of physics, Lorentz played a crucial role in the development of the classical theory of electromagnetism. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, Lorentz formulated the electron theory, which provided electromagnetism with its final form. This theory, often referred to as the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, explained phenomena such as the Zeeman effect, which gave the first indication of the existence of electrons.\n\nLorentz's groundbreaking work also included the establishment of the Lorentz transformation in 1904. This transformation preceded Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity and laid the foundation for it. Lorentz's contributions to theoretical physics were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902.\n\nOutside of his scientific achievements, Lorentz made important contributions to society. He played an influential role in promoting the new developments in physics through his involvement in the Solvay conferences as the chairman. These conferences brought together leading physicists to discuss and advance the field.\n\nFurthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. He chaired the Zuiderzee committee at the national level, contributing to the management and protection of the Zuiderzee, a former inlet of the North Sea in the Netherlands. Internationally, Lorentz served as the president of the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. His leadership in this role helped foster intellectual collaboration between nations.\n\nLorentz's unique greatness was widely recognized, and he was greatly respected by his peers. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time, expressed that Lorentz meant more to him personally than anyone else he had met in his life.\n\nIn summary, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz's contributions to physics include the development of the electron theory, the explanation of the Zeeman effect, and the establishment of the Lorentz transformation. In society, he played a prominent role in advancing physics through the Solvay conferences and held important positions both nationally and internationally. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired.\n\n Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 , which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the \n\n The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918). Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\". In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal \n\n Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities, beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919. Despite the general public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\" Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist's dream come true\". Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.\n\nQuestion: Which scientist was Time magazine's \"Person of the 20th Century\"?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In nine appearances for West Ham he failed to score and had a tame penalty saved in a 2–2 away draw against Everton. In June 2010, West Ham decided not to offer him a new contract.\n\n John Thomas Gordon Ruddy (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United, before signing for Everton as a 19-year-old. He spent five years with Everton, but made just one appearance, while playing on loan at nine different clubs. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League. The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. However, on 25 May 2012, he was ruled out after breaking his finger during training. He made his debut in a 2–1 win against Italy in August 2012. He suffered a long term thigh injury in November 2012, but returned to help Norwich to an 11th-place finish at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.\n\n The 1993–94 Liverpool F.C. season was the 102nd season in the club's existence, and their 32nd consecutive year in the top-flight. Manager Graeme Souness resigned on 29 January 1994 after just under three years in charge following a shock FA Cup exit at the hands of Bristol City, and he was succeeded by long serving coach Roy Evans, who guided the Reds to eighth place in the final table. The season began with the arrival of two notable new players, striker Nigel Clough and defender Neil Ruddock. A month into the season, Liverpool signed defender Julian Dicks from West Ham United, with defender David Burrows and midfielder Mike Marsh heading to East London as part of the deal. January saw the departure of striker Ronny Rosenthal to Tottenham Hotspur. It was the last season at Anfield for long-serving goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar and midfielder Ronnie Whelan, who had both \n\nQuestion: What was the nickname given to premiership footballer Neil Ruddock?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A smaller engine displacement version complies with the Superbike category competition regulations which state \"Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc\" for three and four cylinder 4-stroke engines. The name \"Panigale\" comes from the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The Panigale V4 uses the new Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, derived from the Desmosedici MotoGP racing engine.\n\n and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc road bike then available, the Mach 1. In the 1970s Ducati began producing motorcycles with large-displacement V-twin engines, which Ducati branded as \"L-twin\" fort their 90° angle, and in 1973, introduced their trademarked desmodromic valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \"Cagiva\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \n\n The Ducati 899 Panigale is a 898 cc sport bike from Ducati, released in 2013 to replace the 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. It has a 148 hp version of the engine in the previously released 1199 Panigale. Claimed dry weight is 169 kg. The 899 has a conventional two-sided swingarm, unlike the 1199 which has a single-sided swingarm. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter. This is the first medium-sized Ducati that uses the Superquadro engine. The 899 surprised observers by topping sales charts for all motorcycles in the UK for December 2013, at a price five times higher than the number two seller, the Honda CBF125 — a situation compared by The Telegraph to the Ferrari California outselling the Ford Focus. For 2016, Ducati revised the 899, including enlarging the engine to 955 cc (the 959 Panigale).\n\n The Ducati Panigale V2 is a 955 cc (58.3 cu in) sport bike manufactured by Ducati as the successor to the Panigale 959. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. It was announced in 2019 for the 2020 model year. Chassis was a very similar monocoque with stressed member engine; the engine bore and stroke remained the same; some re-engineering resulted in a 5 hp power increase and Euro 5 emissions compliance.\n\n Urban Enduro version, while not literally an enduro motorcycle, has additional off-road oriented components, namely wire wheels, a handlebar cross bar brace, fork protectors, a sump guard, a headlight grill, and Pirelli MT60 dual-sport tires, and Ducati says the bike \"may be used occasionally on dirt trail\" but it is not designed for \"heavy off-road use\". Cycle Worlds Don Canet said, \"tackling fire roads and mild single-track is well within the Scrambler role\".

It is one of four seas named after common colour terms (the others being the Black Sea, the Red Sea and the White Sea), and its name is descriptive of the golden-yellow colour of the silt-laden water discharged from major rivers. The innermost bay of northwestern Yellow Sea is called the Bohai Sea (previously Pechihli Bay or Chihli Bay), into which flow some of the most important rivers of northern China, such as the Yellow River (through Shandong province and its capital Jinan), the Hai River (through Beijing and Tianjin) and the Liao River (through Liaoning province). The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River. Since 1 November 2018, the Yellow Sea has also served as the location of \"peace zones\" between North and South Korea.\n\n  Korea comprises the Korean Peninsula (the mainland) and 3,960 nearby islands. The peninsula is located in Northeast Asia, between China and Japan. To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia. The Yellow Sea lies to the west, the East China Sea and Korea Strait to the south, and the Sea of Japan to the east. Notable islands include Jeju Island (Jejudo), Ulleung Island (Ulleungdo), and the Liancourt Rocks. At 223,179 km2, the area of Korea is similar to the area of the United Kingdom (244,100 km2) or \n\n Dandong, formerly known as Andong, is a coastal prefecture-level city in southeastern Liaoning province, in the northeastern region of People's Republic of China. It is the largest Chinese border city, facing Sinuiju, North Korea across the Yalu River, which demarcates the Sino-North Korean border. To the southwest of the city, the river flows into Korea Bay. Dandong has therefore had a dynamic history because of its strategic location for the northeast's rich natural resources and because of its convenient access to the ocean. It is designated as a major export production centre for the province, and is a port city connected by rail with Shenyang and Sinuiju. A significant amount of trade with North Korea flows through the city. The size of the administrative city (prefecture) is 14981.4 km2. As of 2010, the built-up area made of 3 urban districts is 830 km2 in size and had 865,576 inhabitants. The administrative city contained approximately 2.45 million inhabitants as of the 2010 census.\n\n Along the northern border with China runs the Yalu River and the Tumen River. In between the rivers, and the source of both, is Paektu Mountain, revered by both the Koreans and Manchurians as the mythic origin of each people. The North Korean government claims that Kim Jong-il was born there when his parents were at a Communist resistance camp at the mountain. The North Korean-Chinese border for 20 miles east of the mountain is \"dry, remote and mountainous, barely patrolled,\" making it one of the crossing areas for refugees from North Korea into China, although most, including refugees from Ryanggang itself, prefer to cross over the Tumen River. Although all of North Korea is economically depressed, Ryanggang province, along with neighboring North Hamgyong and South Hamgyong provinces, are the poorest, forming North Korea's \"Rust Belt\" of industrialized cities with factories now decrepit and failing. The worst hunger of the 1990s famine years occurred in these three provinces, and most refugees into China come from the Rust Belt region.\n\n The Yalu River forms the northern border with China's Liaoning province. The province is also bordered on the east by Chagang Province and on the south by South Pyong'an Province. The Sinŭiju Special Administrative Region is located in the western corner of the province, and was created as an administrative entity separate from North Pyongan in 2002. North Pyongan is bounded by water on the west with Korea Bay and the Yellow Sea.\n\nQuestion: The Yalu river forms a sort of natural border between China and which of its neighbours?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1995 the British Comedy Awards gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award for Comedy, and eight years later, a few weeks before he died, the Television and Radio Industries Club awarded him a Special Award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting. He first appeared on This Is Your Life in 1982 and received a second appearance on the show on 23 April 2003, just months before his death. In a poll of fellow comedians and comedy insiders to find the Comedians' Comedian in 2005, Monkhouse was voted among the best 50 comedy acts. In a piece written several years after Monkhouse's death, critic and satirist Michael Deacon suggested that although Monkhouse had feared that his legacy as a comedian would be limited, as many people knew him only from his decades of work as a game show host, his style of writing and performing could be seen as influencing many contemporary British comedians, such as Jimmy Carr (whose book on comedy The Naked Jape quoted several Monkhouse jokes), Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, John Bishop, Lee Mack and Tim Vine.\n\n Michael James Dominic Sweeney (born 7 February 1955; Bournemouth, England) is an English actor and comedian, best known for his improvisation partnership with Steve Steen. When Sweeney was 11 years old, he moved to London with his parents, along with two brothers and a sister. He became interested in theatre and improvisation while attending Clapham College, an all-boys Roman Catholic school. Sweeney spent the 1970s in theatre productions, creating and touring shows with Steen, who was a friend from school. The pairing's first television work as a duo came on the ITV children's show CBTV, followed by the Channel 4 comedy Little Armadillos and resident support comic slots on Rory Bremner's first sketch show for \n\n Adam Hills (born 10 July 1970) is an Australian comedian and radio and television presenter. In Australia, he hosted the music quiz show Spicks and Specks from 2005 to 2011, and again in 2021, and the talk show Adam Hills Tonight from 2011 to 2013. In the United Kingdom, he has hosted the talk show The Last Leg since 2012. He has been nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award, the Gold Logie Award and numerous BAFTA TV Awards. Born in Loftus, Sydney, he began performing as a stand-up comedian in 1989 at the age of 19 and, since 1997, has produced ten solo shows which have toured internationally. He has performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just for Laughs festival, earning three consecutive Edinburgh Award nominations for his Edinburgh shows in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In 2002, he scored a minor hit in Australia with his single \"Working Class Anthem\", in which he sang the lyrics of the Australian National Anthem to the tune of \"Working Class Man\", a song by Scottish-born Australian rocker Jimmy Barnes.\n\n A former comedy critic for the Evening Standard and editor of Tough Puzzles, Pye has performed as a comedian. He is, however, known best for his work as a writer, having written material for series including Never Mind the Buzzcocks, They Think It's All Over, Armstrong and Miller, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Would I Lie to You?, and Channel 4's The 100 Greatest Cartoons. He also worked as one of the head writers on 8 out of 10 Cats alongside presenter Jimmy Carr and fellow comedian Frankie Boyle. He first met his comedy partner Harry Thompson while working on The 11 O'Clock Show, and together they created the dark satirical animation Monkey Dust, which broadcast on BBC Three for three series.

Six pictures of a celebrity were concealed onstage, ranging from childhood through maturity, and each was revealed one at a time with an accompanying musical clue. A contestant had to correctly name the tune and identify the celebrity pictured to win the game and return on the next episode. For the first picture only, after providing a correct title to the tune, a contestant was given ten seconds to ponder their guess before verbally attempting to identify the celebrity. Contestants who correctly named the celebrity won a cash prize of $10,000 (originally a prize package during the first two weeks). If neither contestant correctly named the tune or identified the celebrity, play continued with a second tune \n\n her ability, which she answered correctly anyway. The $64,000 Question was one of the game shows ultimately implicated to be fixed in some fashion. In September 1956, the Jack Barry-hosted game show Twenty-One premiered on NBC, its first show being played legitimately with no manipulation of the game by the producers at all. That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer Dan Enright, \"a dismal failure\", as the two contestants were so lacking in the required knowledge that they answered a large number of the questions incorrectly. Show sponsor Geritol, upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with \n\n Total Wipeout is a British game show, hosted by Richard Hammond and Amanda Byram, which first aired on the BBC on 3 January 2009. In each episode, contestants competed in a series of challenges in an attempt to win £10,000. These challenges were based in large pools of water or mud and generally involved large assault courses that contestants had to cross. These were gradually eliminated over four rounds until one contestant remained, who won a £10,000 cash prize and a trophy. Total Wipeout was a licensed version of Wipeout, the Endemol show that originated in the United States in 2008, with the name slightly altered to avoid confusion with the BBC version of the earlier game show of the same name. The show originally ran for six series, including a special winter-themed series, from 3 January 2009 until 31 December 2012. In the summer of 2020, Top Gear presenters Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness hosted a six-episode best-of series, featuring the presenters narrating classic episodes of the show, called Total Wipeout: Freddie and Paddy Takeover.\n\n Charles provided the English voice-over commentary for the Challenge (2002–04) rebroadcast of the popular game show Takeshi's Castle, originally by Tokyo Broadcasting System in Japan. In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano for a chance to win large cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the programme and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and also some special and \"best of\" episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term \"Keshi Heads\" to describe fans of the show. A 2013 reboot narrated by Dick and Dom was not as well received.\n\n The five remaining contestants compete in a series of three physical and mental challenges. At the end of each challenge, the contestant who has reached the highest score or finished in the shortest time automatically advances to the next one. The remaining contestants stand at a line of podiums, each equipped with a button, and are offered a cash buyout to quit the game ($2,500 on the first challenge, $5,000 on the second, $7,500 on the third). The first contestant to push their button (if any) receives the buyout money and leaves the competition. If no one accepts the offer, the lowest scorer or slowest finisher is eliminated with no winnings. The buyout/elimination process is similar to that used in the British game show PokerFace. After the third challenge and elimination, the two remaining contestants are given 10 seconds to accept a cash buyout of $10,000. If both of them reject this offer, the one who was less accurate in counting their quarters is eliminated.\n\nQuestion: Name the game show, presented by Leslie Grantham and Melinda Messenger, where contestants were set physical and mental challenges?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

One was as Everett in the 1953 film The Glass Web which was directed by Jack Arnold. Other films include Good Morning, Miss Dove in 1955 and That's the Way of the World in 1975. He was the first host of the ABC-TV & Chuck Barris Game Show Beauty Pageant called The Dream Girl of 1967 from Monday December 19, 1966 to Friday June 23, 1967 except Bob Barker (Future Ex-Host of \"The Price is Right\" Guest Host for Monday-Friday June 12–16, 1967 for promoting Chuck Barris' New Game Show THE FAMILY GAME also on ABC-TV before Wink Martindale Hosted and his 2 Hostess are Beverly Adams (December 19–23, 1966) & Karen Valentine (December 26, 1966 – August 25, 1967.)\n\n dismissal in 1976, Sigley moved to ATV-0 and hosted the early evening variety show Ernie and then, in 1978, The Penthouse which became Saturday Night Live on HSV-7 co-hosting with Mary Hardy. Sigley was the original host of the Australian version of the popular game show Wheel of Fortune from 1981 to 1984. In 1982, he presented the regional variety program Six Tonight from BTV-6 in Ballarat and the daytime talent show Pot Luck in 1987. After a break from television, Sigley returned in 1989 with Denise Drysdale, hosting GTV-9's morning program In Melbourne Today. Sigley was involved in an argument with fellow TV star Don Lane at a Logies after party in 1988, when Sigley allegedly made insulting remarks about Lane's partner.\n\n The radio series was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 5 in 1992, where it was hosted by Nick Hancock. Hancock was also the first presenter when the series transferred to television two years later. The first ever guest on the TV version was comedian Bob Monkhouse who cast the French into Room 101. In 1999, Hancock was replaced as host by Paul Merton (who was also the first ever guest on the original radio version). Merton's first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on Have I Got News for You, Ian Hislop. Usually, there were five nominations discussed in each show – represented by several surreal props. The last item usually goes in, sometimes for a forfeit. Following Merton's departure in 2007, it was announced that a replacement would be sought; however, it was not until 2012 that a twelfth series, now fronted by Frank Skinner, was aired. In July, 2018, Skinner announced that, after 24 years, the show had been cancelled by the BBC.\n\n In his later years, Monkhouse was probably better known for hosting television quiz shows than for being a comedian. One of his biggest successes was The Golden Shot from July 1967 until January 1972 and again from July 1974 to April 1975. This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers. His tenure ended with allegations, which he denied, that he had taken bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements. He returned in 1974 after subsequent presenters and comedians Norman Vaughan and Charlie Williams were found wanting. The dozens of other shows Monkhouse presented included Celebrity Squares, Family Fortunes and Bob's Full \n\n in America. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while rehearsing his new show, Do Re Mi at London's Prince of Wales Theatre. He appeared in several TV series including the sitcom Roamin' Holiday and the variety shows Max and Max Bygraves at the Royalty. From 1983 to 1985, Bygraves hosted Family Fortunes, taking over from his friend and fellow comedian Bob Monkhouse. He would later be succeeded as host in 1987 by Les Dennis. From 1972, Bygraves recorded a series of albums, Sing Along With Max (later Singalongamax), \n\nQuestion: Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, this was challenged in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which described light as discrete and localized quanta of energy (now called photons), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. In 1924 Louis de Broglie presented his thesis concerning the wave–particle duality theory, which proposed the idea that all matter displays the wave–particle duality of photons. According to de Broglie, for all matter and for radiation alike, the energy where h is Planck's constant.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 , which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\".

In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.\n\n  In 1922 Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".

Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest.  The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Sycorax and Setebos, suggesting common origin. However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The satellite appears neutral (grey) in visible light (colour indices B-V=0.80, R-V=0.39), similar to Setebos but different from Sycorax (which is light red).\n\n Portia is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It is also designated Uranus XII. Portia is the second-largest inner satellite of Uranus after Puck. The Portian orbit, which lies inside Uranus' synchronous orbital radius, is slowly decaying due to tidal deceleration. The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Little is known about Portia beyond its size of about 140 km in diameter, orbit, and geometric albedo of about 0.08. In the Voyager 2 images, Portia appears as an elongated object whose major axis points towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of the Portia's prolate spheroid is 0.8 ± 0.1. Its surface is grey in color. Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Portia.\n\n Oberon was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; on the same day he discovered Uranus's largest moon, Titania. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope. All of the moons of Uranus are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. The name Oberon was derived from Oberon, the King of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The names of \n\n Oberon, also designated Uranus IV, is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere. It is likely that Oberon formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy \n\n Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Shakespeare's The Tempest. Both Ariel and the slightly larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious. All of Uranus's moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The Rape of the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest.

A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, it is the first theatrical film in The Muppets franchise. The film was written by The Muppet Show writers Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns. Produced between the first and second half of The Muppet Shows third season, the film tells the origin story of the Muppets, as Kermit the Frog embarks on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, encountering several of the Muppets—who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business—along the way while being pursued by Doc Hopper, an evil restaurateur with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his frog legs business. In addition to the Muppets performers, the film \n\n The film's writers, Nicholas Stoller and Segel, informed McKenzie that he had to avoid alluding to the term \"puppet\", stating that the Muppet characters view themselves as actual people, and never as sentient puppet figures. McKenzie cited power ballads written by artists such as Eric Carmen and Harry Nilsson as inspiration for the song's tone. He also stated that the main reason for the song's inclusion in the film was to have the characters resolve the problem of coming to accept their true selves. Michael Cera and Paul Rudd were considered for the role of Walter's alter-ego. The part was eventually given to Jim Parsons, who described it as \"the role of a lifetime\".\n\n \"Man or Muppet\" is a song from Disney's 2011 musical comedy film The Muppets, written by singer-songwriter Bret McKenzie. Performed by the film's main characters, Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (Peter Linz), the song also features Bill Barretta and Jim Parsons portraying the contrasting identities of Gary and Walter, respectively. The song was released by Walt Disney Records on November 22, 2011, as part of the film's original soundtrack. \"Man or Muppet\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 84th Academy Awards and the Sierra Award for Best Song. It was also nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 55th Grammy Awards, Best Original Song at the Satellite Awards and Best Song at the 17th Critics Choice Awards, in which two other songs from the film, \"Life's a Happy Song\" and \"Pictures in My Head\", were also nominated, with the former winning.\n\n Glinda is the Good Witch of the South and is played by Miss Piggy, as are her sisters the Good Witch of the North and the two Wicked Witches. In keeping with the traditions of Muppet films, she is attracted to the Scarecrow (played by Kermit the Frog). She is portrayed in a lavender dress with a feather boa, an archetypal Hollywood starlet much more in keeping with the character of Miss Piggy rather than Glinda. Miss Piggy's other role is herself. Prior to Dorothy's journey, she appears with Kermit and tries to get rid of Dorothy. After Dorothy's journey, she returns for the Muppets' show.\n\nQuestion: Who dubbed Miss Piggy's singing voice in The Muppet Movie?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although it takes the name of the second Bourne novel (1986), its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy. It is the second installment in the Jason Bourne film series. It is preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone. The film also stars Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy and Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons. Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on July 23, 2004, to positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $290 million on a $75 million budget.\n\n The Bourne Legacy is a 2004 spy fiction thriller written by Eric Van Lustbader. It is the fourth novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum and the first to be written by Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis.\n\n George Nolfi, who co-wrote the screenplay for the Bourne Ultimatum film, was to write the screenplay for a fourth film. Matt Damon was also attached to the project from the start, and Julia Stiles as well as Joan Allen had been asked to join the project, with Paul Greengrass slated to return as director. However, in November 2009 Greengrass said he wasn't interested in directing it, and soon afterwards Matt Damon announced that he would not make the film without Greengrass. On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date. The new film would have nothing but the title in common with Van Lustbader's novel, and would be a side-story with a new character \"in the mold of Bourne\", dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third film. Gilroy also stated that he didn't rule out a future return by Damon or Greengrass. On February 9, 2012, the first trailer was released, which also confirmed the release date of the movie; August 10, 2012.\n\n The Bourne Identity is a 1980 spy fiction thriller by Robert Ludlum that tells the story of Jason Bourne, a man with remarkable survival abilities who has retrograde amnesia, and must seek to discover his true identity. In the process, he must also determine why several shadowy groups, a professional assassin, and the CIA want him dead. It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper.\n\n The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 American action-thriller film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. The screenplay was written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and based on a screen story of the novel by Gilroy. The Bourne Ultimatum is the third installment in the Jason Bourne film series, after The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016. Matt Damon reprises his role as Ludlum's signature character, former CIA assassin and psychogenic amnesiac Jason Bourne. \n\nQuestion: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In several places the Gospel makes clear that the population in general can be called sons of God and Jesus frequently refers to God as \"our Father\" or \"your Father.\" Other than \"blessed are the meek\" in Matthew 5:5 this is perhaps the most famous of the Beatitudes. It was the personal motto of James I of England, and has been used by a number of other groups and organizations. In The Canterbury Tales \"The \n\n own probable origins have proven extremely hard to demonstrate\". Similarly, while it is widely accepted that there is a connection with Zoroastrian (Persian) sources underlying Matthew's story of the Magi (the wise men from the East) and the Star of Bethlehem, a wider claim that Zoroastrianism formed the background to the infancy narratives has not achieved acceptance. The Gospel of Luke says Mary is a virgin betrothed to Joseph, while the Gospel of Matthew says Jesus's virginal conception happens before Mary lives with Joseph in his house, because, in a Jewish wedding, by being betrothed to a man, the woman is already his wife, yet she does not \n\n to stay with Zechariah and Elizabeth temporarily. Joseph remains behind in Galilee, tormented by jealousy, until an angel visits him. Joseph's father Jacob dies and, afterwards, Joseph goes to Mary as the angel instructed. After they are married, Joseph takes Mary with him to Bethlehem, where taxes must be paid. Unable to find other accommodations, they stay in a stable, where Mary gives birth to Jesus. They are visited by wise men who bring gifts to the newborn Messiah. The wise men originally came on behalf of King Herod, who has ordered the execution of all male babies in Jerusalem to prevent the Messiah from coming to power. The wise men are warned to flee from Herod and Joseph is warned to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. The book ends with them on the journey to Egypt.\n\n Matthew 2:11 is the eleventh verse of the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The magi, dispatched by King Herod, have found the infant Jesus and in this verse present him with gifts in an event known as the Visit of the Wise Men. In art, it is traditionally referred to as the Adoration of the Magi.\n\n The Gospel of Matthew tells how the Magi (often translated as \"wise men\", but more accurately astrologers) arrive at the court of Herod in Jerusalem and tell the king of a star which signifies the birth of the King of the Jews: \"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him.” 3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, \n\nQuestion: The Bible tells of 3 wise men visiting Jesus after his birth, but in which of the Gospels does this appear?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Each challenges him to a duel. At the appointed place, upon learning they are all there to duel the same man the master swordsmen are amused by the newcomer's audacity. Before they can begin, however, they are interrupted by Richelieu's guards, who try to arrest the Musketeers.

(They are referred to as musketeers throughout the cartoon and only the title calls them 'muskehounds'.) He quickly befriends three musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis) saving Juliette, a maid-in-waiting for Queen Anne of Austria. A key difference between the Dogtanian adaptions and Dumas' novel is that the character traits of Athos and Porthos were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.\n\n René d'Herblay, alias Aramis, is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers (1844), Twenty Years After (1845), and The Vicomte de Bragelonne (1847-1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père. He and the other two musketeers, Athos and Porthos, are friends of the novels' protagonist, d'Artagnan. The fictional Aramis is loosely based on the historical musketeer Henri d'Aramitz.\n\n Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds is a fictional character in the novels The Three Musketeers (1844), Twenty Years After (1845), and The Vicomte de Bragelonne (1847-1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père.

Spaying: This is the sterilization of a female dog through a hysterectomy, which involves the removal of the uterus and ovaries.\n\n2. Neutering: This is the sterilization of a male dog through the removal of the testicles. Neutering is usually performed to prevent unwanted pregnancies and decrease certain health risks.\n\n3. Dewclaw Removal: Dewclaws are vestigial nails located on the inside of a dog's leg. In some cases, they may be surgically removed to prevent injury or complications.\n\n4. Docking: Docking is the surgical removal of most of a dog's tail. This procedure is often performed for certain breeds for cosmetic or historical reasons, although it's a topic of debate and may be illegal in some areas.\n\nWhen it comes to common health conditions related to dogs, here are a few examples:\n\n1. Hip Dysplasia: This is a hereditary condition where the hip joint fails to develop properly. It is most commonly seen in larger dog breeds.\n\n2. Lipomas: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that are quite common in older dogs. While they're generally harmless, they may need to be monitored or surgically removed if they become problematic.\n\n3. Parasites: Dogs can be affected by various internal and external parasites, including heartworms, fleas, ticks, tapeworms, and mites. Preventive measures, such as regular deworming and the use of parasite control products, are essential.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other procedures and conditions related to dogs. If you have any concerns about your dog's health, it's best to consult with a veterinarian for a thorough examination and proper diagnosis.\n\nConsult your veterinarian about particularly large hot spots.Antibiotics or hydrocortisone cream may be required.Clean the area daily with antibacterial and astringent products until it is completely healed.If the area is small, clip away hair and clean with hydrogen peroxide.These moist skin lesions will cause a dog great discomfort and, if untreated, can worsen rapidly.Vomiting: A dog who vomits once or twice in a 24-hour period should be monitored. In many cases, the problem will simply go away. However, persistent vomiting for 12 hours necessitates a trip to the vet. Vomiting blood necessitates immediate veterinary attention. Weight Loss: Pronounced weight loss can indicate any number of disorders, including cancer. However, it could also simply mean that the dog isn't receiving enough calories. Consult your veterinarian. ## Minor Hardware Glitches\n\nMinor malfunctions can often be resolved using basic first-aid techniques. To gauge if the problem is indeed minor, ask what you would do if the same injury was sustained by a child. If you would take the child to a hospital, then take the dog to a veterinarian. Damaged Dewclaws: Excessive nail growth, coupled with the dewclaws' lack of bony support, make them prone to lacerations if caught on carpeting, underbrush, or tall grass. If the tear is small, treat as a superficial cut (see \"Superficial Cuts and Scrapes\"). If severe, consult your veterinarian. Professional (surgical) removal of the dewclaw is often the best course of action. Doggy Breath: May indicate gum disease, severe plaque buildup, or a number of other dental disorders. Sweet, fruity breath can indicate diabetes. Hot Spots: These are localized allergic reactions that trigger severe itching and self-inflicted irritation (usually via licking). These moist skin lesions will cause a dog great discomfort and, if untreated, can worsen rapidly. If the area is small, clip away hair and clean with hydrogen peroxide. Clean the area daily with antibacterial and astringent products until it is completely healed. Antibiotics or hydrocortisone cream may be required. Consult your veterinarian about particularly large hot spots.Apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Skin Irritation: Cleanse area, remove the causative agent, and apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Superficial Cuts and Scrapes: Cleanse the area with mild soap and water.Baby wipes work well.Apply triple antibiotic ointment twice daily.\n\n in a human. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \"hands\" and \"feet\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. Humans usually walk with the soles of their feet on the ground, in plantigrade locomotion. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs).\n\n can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe. The cassowary has claws up to 125 mm long. Ostrom cited Gilliard (1958) in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man. Kofron (1999 and 2003) studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed, but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals. Cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves, to attack threatening animals, and in agonistic displays such as the Bowed Threat Display. The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw, and uses it to tear apart \n\n Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”).

Bobbin lace is made by weaving the threads by moving the bobbins over or under each other. Much bobbin lace is based on a net ground. By the end of the 18th century, people tried to produce the net ground mechanically. In 1765 they managed to create a tulle-like fabric on a so-called stocking framework. It took, however, some more years until the first real tulle could be produced mechanically. The forerunner of the bobbinet machine was the 1589 stocking frame, a weaving frame fitted with a bar of bearded needles \n\n  Bobbinet tulle or genuine tulle is a specific type of tulle which has been made in the United Kingdom since the invention of the bobbinet machine. John Heathcoat coined the term \"bobbin net\", or bobbinet as it is spelled today, to distinguish this machine-made tulle from the handmade \"pillow lace\", produced using a lace pillow to create bobbin lace. Machines based on his original designs are still in operation today producing fabrics in Perry Street, Chard, Somerset, UK. When bobbinet is woven with spots, it is called point d'esprit.\n\n Cable ties were first invented by Thomas & Betts, an electrical company, in 1958 under the brand name Ty-Rap. Initially they were designed for airplane wire harnesses. The original design used a metal tooth, and these can still be obtained. Manufacturers later changed to the nylon/plastic design. Over the years the design has been extended and developed into numerous spin-off products. One example was a self-locking loop developed as an alternative to purse-string suture in colon anastomosis. Ty-Rap cable tie inventor, Maurus C. Logan, worked for Thomas & Betts and finished his career with the company as Vice President of Research and Development. During his tenure at Thomas & Betts, he contributed to the development and marketing of many successful Thomas & Betts products. Logan \n\n  An aiguillette (, from aiguille, \"needle\"), also spelled aguillette, aiglet or aglet, is a cord with metal tips or lace tags, or the decorative tip itself. Functional or purely decorative fasteners of silk cord with metal tips popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, sometimes of gold set with gemstones or enameled, are generally called \"aiglets\", \"aglets\" or \"points\". In modern usage, an \"aiguillette\" is an ornamental braided cord with decorative metal tips worn on uniforms or as part of other costumes such as academic dress, where it will denote an honour. This usage of \"aiguillette\" derives from lacing used to fasten plate armor together. As such, a knot or loop arrangement was used which sometimes hung from the shoulder. These aiguillettes should not be confused with lanyards, which are cords also worn from the shoulder (or around the neck), but do not have the pointed aiguillette tips and are usually of fibre rather than gold or silver wire, and often not braided. The modern aglet or shoelace tip and the decorative tips on bolo ties are types of aiguillettes.\n\n An aglet is a permanent ending applied mechanically to bind the end of the rope. A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables.

The straits also served as an important component of military strategy; whoever wielded control of traffic through the straits could use them as an exit or entry point for naval forces to traverse to and from the Black Sea and prevent rival powers from doing so.\n\n or rather Sarmatians since they have some similar customs to them. Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD, would describe the Vistula as the border between Germania and Sarmatia. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman. It provided a link with the Black Sea to the south through the Oginski Canal, Dnieper River, Berezina Canal, and Dvina River.

The borders to Western Europe and Eastern Europe are geographically less defined, and for this reason the cultural and historical boundaries migrate more easily west–east than south–north. The river Rhine, which runs south–north through Western Germany, is an exception. Southwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube – and their respective floodplains. The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine (\"peri- Pannonian states\"). \n\n transport since there are 1,716 kilometers of navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the country.

So how can I demand from the universe some sort of rationale for the bad that I've never demanded for the good?\" Smith married Steven Naifeh, his co-author and partner of 40 years, in 2011. \"It took enormous grit and determination to stage this heroic ongoing battle against his brain tumor,\" Naifeh said to the Aiken Standard. \"Yet, it never robbed him of his passion for life. Or his sweetness. He was so unassuming about his intellectual gifts, so guileless, that he had an extraordinary capacity to help people understand how special they were in their own ways.\"\n\n Smith married Jerry Saltz, senior art critic for New York magazine, in 1992. The couple lives in an apartment in Greenwich Village.\n\n In 1923, Smith was living in Philadelphia when she met Jack Gee, a security guard, whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was being released. During the marriage, Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female sex partners for Bessie. Gee was impressed by the money, but never adjusted to show business life or to Smith's bisexuality. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, Gertrude Saunders, Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce. Smith later entered a common-law marriage with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was Lionel Hampton's uncle. She stayed with him until her death.\n\n Stern was Smith's attorney who was named executor of her will which was drafted in 2001 by Eric James Lund, Esq. During the case, Stern denied that he had received money from media interviews he has conducted since Smith's death, though he admitted that he gave an interview to Entertainment Tonight on a flight that the show chartered immediately after her death. As a lawyer of Smith's in the continuing litigation over the estate of her late husband, billionaire J. Howard Marshall, he would be entitled to a contingent fee of roughly $5 million, five percent of any money she was awarded. He claimed to be the biological father of baby Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern. Following the death of the baby's half-brother Daniel Wayne Smith, Smith put his name on the disputed second birth certificate issued for the baby then known as Hannah Rose.\n\n Smith has been married four times. Her first marriage was to actor Roger Davis (1968–1975). She married Dennis Cole, an actor who appeared on Charlie's Angels in 1977 and 1978. Cole appeared on the show two more times before the couple divorced in 1981. Cole's son from a previous marriage, Joe Cole, with whom Smith had maintained a relationship after her divorce from his father, was murdered in 1991 during a robbery; the case remains unsolved. In 1981, Smith married filmmaker Tony Richmond, with whom she had two children, Gaston (born 1982) and Spencer Margaret (born 1985), before divorcing Richmond in 1989. Smith has been married to Houston cardiothoracic surgeon Brad Allen since 1997. Smith was treated for breast cancer in 2003.

Compensation for the failed title bid came in the form of the club's first ever Football League Cup victory, which came with a 2–1 win over Liverpool in the Wembley final. Charlie Nicholas scored both of Arsenal's goals, making them the first team to beat Liverpool when Ian Rush had scored. Tony Adams, the 20-year-old centre-half who played in every single game for Arsenal this season, was voted PFA Young Player of the Year.

Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free \n\n Many pundits had tipped Everton for relegation that season: having escaped relegation from the Premier League by six points the previous season, Everton's task to stay in English football's top flight only seemed harder after the multimillion-pound transfer of teenage striker Wayne Rooney to Manchester United after setting the summer's European Championships alight. However, the season turned out to be Everton's most successful in Premier League history as they placed fourth in the league with 61pts. Everton kept pace with the likes of Chelsea (95pts) and Arsenal (83pts) at the Premier League summit for the first half of the season, finishing 2004 only a few points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Although Everton's title challenge eventually fizzled out following the sale of out-of-contract midfielder Thomas Gravesen to Spanish giants \n\n first-time shot was turned over the bar by Lehmann. The consequent corner broke to Rooney on the edge of the penalty area, but his shot was deflected behind for another corner, which Scholes took. The England midfielder floated the ball over to the edge of the penalty area, where Rooney was waiting, only to volley it just over the bar. In the closing stages of the first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball trickling along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans and the sound of the referee's half-time whistle.\n\n After spending the last few seasons struggling against relegation, Everton, revitalised under David Moyes, spent the season challenging for European qualification, at one stage going ahead of arch-rivals Liverpool, who had finished runners-up the previous season. Everton memorably ended Arsenal's unbeaten run in a match at Goodison Park which saw teenage striker Wayne Rooney score the winner, his debut Premiership goal. Rooney was later nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, but lost to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas. The club had less luck in the FA Cup.

Cheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle's highly popular stories as an adolescent. In the ensuing years, he played a major role in rendering them first into classical and later into vernacular Chinese. Cheng Xiaoqing's translated works from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced China to a new type of narrative style. Western detective fiction that was translated often emphasized “individuality, equality, and the importance of knowledge”, appealing to China that it was the time for opening their eyes to the rest of the world. This style began China's interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle's style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. Famed as the “Oriental Sherlock Holmes”, the duo Huo Sang and Bao Lang become counterparts to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson characters.\n\n Jeremy Black, a historian, points out that a number of Agatha Christie's novels of the interwar period record the standard fears of affluent society in the era. She added the \"paranoid\" conviction of an underlying conspiracy. This is an element present in her literary work and absent in the adaptations of Agatha Christie for television and film. Black adds that Christie's work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges. The Big Four, the characters, are positioned as the hidden cause and connecting threat between the world-wide unrest, labour disputes, and the revolutions of the period—in particular, the October Revolution, with \n\n Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of crime fiction. Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.\n\n The Big Four is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by William Collins & Sons on 27 January 1927 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. It features Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings, and Inspector Japp. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The structure of the novel is different from other Poirot stories, as it began from twelve short stories (eleven in the US) that had been separately published. This is a tale of international intrigue and espionage, therefore opening up the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie.\n\n Doyle pursued an education in the medical field,where he began writing short stories. Conan Doyle, who is best known for his novels detailing the life of Victorian detective Sherlock Holmes, also has written numerous short stories, nonfiction works, historical novels, short stories, poetry and one operetta. Conan Doyle published The Sign of Four in 1890, which established Sherlock Holmes as a prominent character and did wonders in putting Conan Doyle on the map literature map in the United Kingdom and United States. However, Conan Doyle is said to have balanced writing historical novels with novels featuring Sherlock Holmes in the early 1890s. In the year Conan Doyle published The Great Shadow, His wife, Louisa, gave birth to a son named Kingsley. Conan Doyle calls this \"the chief event' of their life.

He sporadically produced eleven more articles between 1863–65 and an expanded edition of the work was printed in 1866. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875.

It is revealed that much of Charles' animosity towards his father stems from his childhood trauma of laboring in a blacking factory after his family was taken to debtors' prison, all due to John Dickens' failure to pay his debts. Returning to the long-abandoned factory, Charles is forced to confront his own insecurities through Scrooge. Charles realizes that his story should be one of redemption and races home to finish his manuscript. As he is about to leave his home \n\n On the death of Charles Dickens, her father inherited the magazine All the Year Round, and Mary Angela Dickens published some of her earliest work in this periodical. She authored several popular sentimental and melodramatic novels during the 1890s, including Cross Currents (1891), probably her best known work, A Mere Cypher (1893), A Valiant Ignorance (1894), and Prisoners of Silence (1895). Her later works included Against the Tide (1897), and On the Edge of a Precipice (1899). She also produced a number of books for children based on the novels of her grandfather, including Children's Stories from Dickens (1893) and Dickens' Dream Children (1926). These were illustrated by Harold Copping. A 1911 copy of her Children's Stories from Dickens, from a limited edition of 500 copies signed by herself and four other granddaughters of Charles Dickens, was owned by Eleanor Roosevelt. It was sold at auction by Christie's at their New York sale in 2001. By the early 1900s her sensationalist style of writing had fallen out of fashion, and by about 1916 she had stopped writing. However, her children's books based on the works of her grandfather continued to be popular.\n\n experience did not curb Neville's intellectual curiosity; at a very young age he was expanding his cultural horizons, through the worlds of reading and of music hall and pantomime. When he was 10 years old he discovered the novels of Dickens; years later he wrote that there were two classes of person, \"those who have it in them from birth onwards to appreciate Dickens and those who haven't. The second group should be avoided as soon as detected\". His earliest creative writing took the form of a handwritten magazine, The Boy's World, full of articles and stories he had written.

It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman.

It empties into the Vistula Lagoon (Zalew Wiślany) or directly into the Gdańsk Bay of the Baltic Sea with a delta of six main branches (Leniwka, Przekop, Śmiała Wisła, Martwa Wisła, Nogat and Szkarpawa). The river is often associated with Polish culture, history and national identity. It is the country's most important waterway and natural symbol, and the term \"Vistula Land\" (kraj nad Wisłą) can be synonymous with Poland.\n\n The Mária Valéria Bridge joins Esztergom in Hungary and Štúrovo in Slovakia, across the River Danube. The bridge is some 500 metres in length. It is named after Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria (1868–1924), the fourth child of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Franz Josef and Elisabeth. The bridge was designed by in 1893; he built several bridges on the Danube, including the Liberty Bridge (originally the Franz Joseph Bridge) in Budapest and the Elisabeth Bridge between Komárno and Komárom. Since its opening on 28 September 1895, the bridge has been destroyed twice. On 22 July 1919 the bridge was destroyed by a detonation at its \n\n Geography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the north across the Baltic Sea, namely Northern Europe (or Scandinavia), and to the south across the Alps, the Apennine peninsula (or Italy), and the Balkan peninsula across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to Western Europe and Eastern Europe are geographically less defined, and for this reason the cultural and historical boundaries migrate more easily west–east than south–north. The river Rhine, which runs south–north through Western Germany, is an exception. Southwards, the Pannonian Plain is bounded by the rivers Sava and Danube – and their respective floodplains. The Pannonian Plain stretches over the following countries: Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia, and touches borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine (\"peri- Pannonian states\"). \n\n transport since there are 1,716 kilometers of navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the country. The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-European Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Eastern Europe via the Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian rivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad, Belgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac.\n\nQuestion: The River Danube runs through which three European capital cities?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth. A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water. Finswimmers do not \n\n volume. The main difficulty or danger is that it must fit the whole face perfectly and since no two faces are the same shape, it should be used with great care and in safe water. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth. As a result of a short period with an unusually high number \n\nNeti is a technique used in the cleansing of the air passages in the head. The neti is an integral part of Hindu shatkarma, which is a logic system for body cleaning techniques. The main types of the neti are: Jala Neti uses water while sutra Neti uses a string.\nNeti clear away all the bacteria and dirt filled mucus from deep within the nose.\nIt works by draining sinus cavities. This helps the body to reprogramme its natural mechanisms against infections such as allergies, sinusitis, hay fever, and the upper respiratory problems like painful throats, cough, inflamed tonsils and adenoids.\nNeti is beneficial in asthma and bronchitis as it decreases the propensity of the asthma patient to breathing from mouth by making the air passage clear by removing mucus.\nIt gives a cooling effect on brain by removing the excessive heat, and hence it is beneficial for headaches, epilepsy, migraine, temper tantrums, depression, hysteria and general mental conditions.\nIt is beneficial with the problems that affect the eyes. It helps flush the tear ducts and encourages the clear vision.\nIt is beneficial in certain type of ear problems such as tinitis, glue ear, middle ear infections.\nNeti helps in restoration of lost sense of odor, and thereby helps with the taste and digestive processes.\nIt has a good effect on the pineal and pituitary glands that control the hormonal system. This has an integrating effect on emotional behavior.\nNeti helps in awakening higher states of meditation by affecting the psychic centre.\nIt stimulates the power of visualization and increases concentration of mind and gives a feeling of lightheadness and provides clarity to the mind.\nIt also helps smokers to give up smoking.\nThere are mainly two types of neti: Jala neti and sutra neti.\nIn jala neti is used for cleansing sinus passages with the help of warm saline water.\nIf a person wants to perform nasal cleansing, he can do it over a sink, on a bowl on a table, inside the shower. Procedure to be followed to perform neti is as follows.\nFill the neti pot with warm water neither to hot nor to cold. The temperature of water has to be suitable for pouring in the nose.\nTo check the temperature pour a bit on your arm or taste it and then spit to check its temperature. Water has to be a little hotter than warm. Pure water is best for performing neti.\nMix one teaspoon of salt in half a liter of water. Maintain the tonicity of the water and make it isotonic (0.9%) solution as it is same as human blood. Sea salt is best for this purpose. Mix the salt thoroughly in water.\nTo check the correct mix and temperature, taste a little water and then spit it. It will not to be as salty as sea water, adjust the salt concentration if not correct.\nPlace the nose cone in the right nostril, and sealing it after a few twists and slight pressure.\nPut the spout straight up in the line with the nasal passage so that the tip of the nozzle will not get blocked inside the nose. Breathe gently through mouth.\nAt this time, do not sniff, laugh, talk, swallow or do not have any kind of movement through the nose while water is flowing through it.\nNow slowly bend in front from the waist so that the tip of the nose will become the lowest point of the head; slightly tilt the head to the right, so that left nostril will become the lowest point of the nose. Tilt slowly so that water will not come out of the top onto your face.\nKeep the cone of the neti vessel fully sealed into the right nostril so that it doesn’t leak. Keep the breathing on while the water comes through it.\nWait a few seconds so that water should run out of the left nostril. Keep breathing through the mouth slowly. After the water starts to run, wait about 30 seconds so that half of water in the pot to flow right to left, After that remove the pot and stand straight.\nBefore going on other side, Blow out air gently through both nostrils to clear mucus and water from the nose.\nRepeat the steps, with nose cone entering the left nostril and the flow of the water is from left to right. After the whole liquid finished, stand up and blow out gently through both nostrils and then prepare to dry out the nose.\nIf after performing above steps, still any mucus blockage remain then repeat this whole process again several times until it get clear. Even after this, if your nose doesn’t get clear than it is recommended that you visit the family physician to ascertain if there is some kind of structural blockage in the nose.\nForward bend drying of the nose properly is very important part of this practice. Don’t neglect this part. People suffering from high blood pressure should be careful while doing this part. If dizziness occurs while using neti the nose, drying should be done standing upright. .\nFirst bend towards forward from the waist and do head upside down with the nose towards the floor that will help any residual water to remove from the nose. Then the nose is to be pointed towards the knees. In each position, breathe in from the mouth and breathe out from the nose 10 times.\nThen resume the standing position and do some fast breathing through the nostrils. Breathe 10 times through both the nostrils together with more emphasis on the exhalation part. Then do 10 rapid sniffing breathes again through both the nostrils together. If you feel that there is a chance of having some water in there than repeat the whole process again. It is important dry nose properly as it may manifest the symptoms of cold for some hours, or in some cases it may cause sinus problem.\nThe second stage of Jala neti is called as sinus bellowing, or Vyutkrama kapalbhati. Before attempting, the second stage it is always advisable to master the stage one which is a simpler version. This stage should be performed in a teacher’s supervision on the first few attempts.\nWhile the water is going from one nostril to other, it is gently breathe backwards and through out of the mouth. One should not swallow any water when they sniff backwards, although it’s not dangerous.\nWhen performing vyutkrama kapalbhati, stage 1 procedure has to be followed for first one potful of water, and then on the second full pot is done in more advance way. It is not essential to dry the nose completely between the 2 stages. The nose has to be dry completely after stage 2, as more water flow from the nasal passages.\nIt may cause serious irritation for some time if nose is not dried completely. Vyutkrama kapalbhati neti works target more on clearing out the posterior sinus passages which stage 1 not able to reach and it is more effective than stage1 for sinusitis, post nasal drip, snoring, chronic catarrh, coughs, thyroid imbalances.\nInhale water separately through each nostril and through it out of the mouth than do both simultaneously.\nDo not consume; to avoid infection dry nose completely.\nIn Dugdha neti, milk is used in place of water, pre-warmed to body temperature, It is suitable for those person who suffer from chronic nose bleeds or those who get irritation from the use of salty water. Milk Neti is done in case where the nasal lining is already irritated, for example in case of sanding plaster.\nPre-warmed milk, warmed to body temperature is used in place of water, It is appropriate for the person who suffers from chronic nose bleeds or those who have sensitivity from the use of salty water.\nMilk neti is used in case where nasal mucosa is already irritated, from the sanding plaster. For best results use it after warm salty water is used in stage 1 and 2.\nSutra Neti can be of a very great importance, and it is very much recommended for those who tried jala neti for some time and persons who find that most of the time the same nostril is blocked. Some time there is a problem like some kind of fleshy obstruction such as cartilages.\nInstead of a medical operation, Sutra neti is possible alternative for removing these blockages. Firstly one should try to succeed with the different forms of jala neti using water, and if this not able to clear blockages, a proper medical examination is needed to know the cause of the structural blockage. Sutra neti should be learned in the guidance of an experienced person.\nBefore and after performing sutra neti, it is recommended to rinse the string either in warm water or in case of specialized cases medicated oils. Then place it straightly to dry. In case of polpys, deviated septum or other diseases related to nose consult to the ENT specialist.\nThe string of sutra neti is slowly and non-mechanically inserted along the floor of the nasal cavity. Nasal cavity is narrow at the top and it is widest at the bottom, it is like a roof. Hence keep the string straight positioned towards the back side of the throat, a little towards downward and slightly inward so it will go smoothly inside the back opening of the nose.\nCare should be taken so that you won’t experience any pain at the time of insertion. If you experience any pain, it is because of going too fast or the string is pointed in the wrong side, or it is scratched the nasal wall, or there may be some other obstruction. If the condition likes this arise and twist the string in one or other direction until a clear passage from the cave is found.\nIt is advisable to keep the tip of string smooth while keeping a little downward direction of the tip throughout the insertion, So that while going under the medium bottom lip of the nasal pharyngeal valve at the entrance to the throat, it points downward toward the mouth.\nA copious mucous flow is activated, so keep the good supply of tissues handy. Take your time, slowly and gently easing the string forward; enjoy the cleansing effects and always breathing deeply. For best results perform sutra Neti after rising in the morning with other cleansing morning activities.\n\n A snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving mask. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for underwater activities such as spearfishing, freediving, finswimming, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and for surface breathing with scuba equipment. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and constructed of light metal, rubber or plastic. The snorkel may come with a rubber loop or a plastic \n\nIt goes without saying that water sports are very popular in Hawaii. After all, being surrounded by the ocean presents the unique opportunity to enjoy activities like surfing, swimming, body surfing, body boarding, paddling and more year-round.\nWhile all of these activities are fun, Dr. John Cho, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Straub Medical Center, shares some knowledge on how to prevent and treat common water-induced ear diagnoses like surfer’s ear, swimmer’s ear and perforated ear drums.\nSwimmer’s ear, or otitis externa, can occur when water remains in the outer ear after a swimming session. Combined with a warm environment, this excess water creates a fungal-friendly living place.\nCommon germs include bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginos, and fungus, like Aspergillus niger.\nSome symptoms of swimmer’s ear can include redness, itchiness, pain, temporary hearing loss and pus-like fluid draining from the ear.\nWear customized ear plugs in the water.\nVisit an ear, nose and throat specialist for periodic cleaning.\nOnce the ear canal swells and debris begins to accumulate, the germs that create swimmer’s ear are very resilient and can be difficult to get out.\nFollowing a physician evaluation, treatment consists of cleaning the external ear, pain medication and no water exposure for five to seven days.\nSurfer’s ear, or exostosis, occurs due to a constant exposure to cold water and wind, which makes the condition very rare in Hawaii. This combination encourages bony developments to grow in the ear, therefore restricting the ear canal. This process cannot be reversed without surgery and may result in hearing loss and a predisposition to ear infections.\nAvoid extremely cold water. Wetsuits do not protect the ears.\nWear swim caps or neoprene hoods in the water.\nTreatment consists of monitoring the ear, maintaining ear health and sometimes surgery. Maintenance and cleaning of the ear are huge parts of the treatment process because without this step, ear infections can become much more frequent.\nA perforated ear drum can happen in water sports when traumatic forces act upon the ear. For example, if an ear is slapped by a wave, the pressure could cause the ear drum to rupture, which makes it more susceptible to infection.\nTreatment usually consists of letting the ear heal on its own. However, having an ear, nose and throat specialist monitor the status of the ruptured ear drum is extremely important to ensure the ear is healing properly.\nThe time spent out of the water will depend on the severity of the rupture and the healing process.\n\nQuestion: In which sport or pastime can you see nose walking?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The eye can be thought of as an enclosed compartment through which there is a constant circulation of fluid that maintains its shape and internal pressure. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg.\n\nWe offer advanced glaucoma screening and the latest glaucoma treatment Glaucoma is described as an abnormal buildup of pressure inside your eyes. As this detrimental eye disease progresses, it will cause permanent vision loss. When left untreated for a few years, glaucoma can lead to total blindness.\nAt Executive Park Eye Care, our eye doctors will perform a glaucoma test as part of your comprehensive eye exam. During the early stages of the disease, glaucoma symptoms may be absent, and a thorough evaluation of your eye health is the only reliable way to detect the condition. Our Colorado Springs office is equipped with state-of-the-art optometric technology that will diagnose glaucoma accurately.\nWho is at high risk for Glaucoma?\nAlthough increased pressure inside your eye is generally the main indication of glaucoma, there are other glaucoma symptoms that can be detected during an eye exam by our optometrists in Colorado Springs. In addition to a glaucoma test done with specialized equipment, we will also inspect your retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye) to screen for this ocular disease and make a firm diagnosis.\nWhat happens during a Glaucoma Eye Exam in Colorado Springs, CO?\nA few different types of testing procedures are currently used to diagnose glaucoma.\nAfter your eye is numbed with eye drops, a tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure (IOP). Either a small probe is placed gently on the surface of your eye, or a puff of air is directed onto your eye to take this measurement. A high IOP result points to a problem with the amount of fluid in your eye, yet this measurement is not always enough to diagnose glaucoma for certain.\nOCT or other digital imagery instruments are used to create images of your eye’s optic nerve, and then the imaging technique is repeated over time to check for changes. Differences in the images may indicate progressive glaucoma damage to your eye.\nAre there any Glaucoma Symptoms?\nGlaucoma usually begins by attacking your peripheral vision, which explains why glaucoma symptoms may not be noticed for a long time. Unfortunately, once you notice vision loss in the center region of your eye, the ocular disease has probably been present for a long while. Only regular, complete eye examinations can identify glaucoma before it gets to this point. For the best preventive care – contact us to schedule your eye exam and glaucoma test in our optometry practice in Colorado Springs.\nWhat are some Glaucoma Treatments offered by eye doctors in Colorado Springs?\nThe current goal of all glaucoma treatments is to lower or stabilize the pressure in your eye, which will hopefully prevent damage to your optic nerve. The first line of defense is typically medicated eye drops. Depending upon how far the disease has progressed, other glaucoma treatments include conventional (bladed) surgery, laser procedures or a combination of all of the above. If you are prescribed eye drops, it’s critical to continue taking them regularly and not to become negligent about it. Discontinuing your eye drops may lead to vision loss.\n\n(IOP). Left untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness.\nWhat's the difference between glaucoma and ocular hypertension?\nOcular hypertension is another term for high eye pressure. In ocular hypertension, IOP is higher than normal but does not cause optic nerve damage and vision loss. Ocular hypertension is a risk factor for glaucoma and should be monitored closely.\nWhy does my eye doctor want to do more than one kind of glaucoma test?\nThe two most common types of \"glaucoma tests\" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry.\nIn non-contact tonometry (NCT), an instrument emits a quick puff of air toward the surface of your eye. Nothing but air touches your cornea.\nThough NCT typically is a very accurate way to determine the pressure within your eye (intraocular pressure, or IOT), it is considered a screening measurement. The \"gold standard\" method for measuring eye pressure is called applanation tonometry.\nIn applanation tonometry, the instrument that measures your IOT has a small sensor that gently touches the surface of your eye.\nIf you have NCT performed during your eye exam, your eye doctor might want to recheck the pressure measurement by performing applanation tonometry (especially if your NCT measurement is borderline high).\nYour doctor may also want to dilate your pupils to directly examine and photograph your optic nerve, or to check for vision loss with a visual field test.\nWho is most at risk for glaucoma?\nIf you're over age 60, African-American, diabetic or have a family member with glaucoma, you are at higher risk for glaucoma than others.\nIs there any way to prevent glaucoma?\nThough it's unclear whether glaucoma can be prevented, you might be able to reduce your risk for the disease by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\"Though many researchers are studying whether certain nutrients might lower a person's risk for glaucoma, no definitive evidence currently exists to support using nutritional supplements as a means of preventing glaucoma.\" says Dr. Burt Dubow, optometrist and AllAboutVision.com editorial advisory board member.\n\"My recommendation is to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol, eat a healthy diet, keep your weight down, exercise, and see your eye specialist on a regular basis to monitor your eye health.\"\nThere are usually no signs that you're developing glaucoma until vision loss occurs, which is why it's so important to have regular eye exams. Your eye doctor can detect and treat high IOP before it progresses to optic nerve damage and vision loss.\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma. The other types are: normal-tension, narrow-angle, closed-angle, congenital, pigmentary and secondary.\nVision loss from glaucoma cannot be reversed. Routine eye exams are essential to discover glaucoma early and begin glaucoma treatment before significant vision loss has occurred.\nWhat glaucoma treatments are currently available?\nDoctors usually prescribe special glaucoma eye drops that reduce intraocular pressure. These are used one or several times a day, depending on the medication. If the drops don't work, surgery may be the next step. In some cases, surgery might be the first option for glaucoma treatment.\nCan marijuana be used to treat glaucoma?\nThe possible use of marijuana for the management of glaucoma has been debated for years. Interest is based on studies that have shown cannabis, when smoked or ingested orally, is capable of mildly reducing IOP for up to four hours. However, the current consensus among clinicians is that medical marijuana needs further research as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma, and that it currently does not appear to be as effective as FDA-approved glaucoma medications and treatments.\nCan I have LASIK surgery if I have glaucoma?\nPeople being treated for glaucoma typically are not good candidates for LASIK. This is because a suction device is used on the eye during the creation of the corneal flap during LASIK surgery, and this briefly causes a significant increase in IOP.\nBut you might be a candidate for another type of vision correction surgery, such as PRK, which does not require the use of a suction device.\n\nTonometry is a technique used by eye care professionals to measure the intraocular pressure (IOP), which refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. It plays a crucial role in evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can lead to damage of the optic nerve and vision loss if left untreated.\n\nBy measuring IOP, tonometry helps eye care professionals assess the risk of developing glaucoma or monitor its progression in individuals already diagnosed with the condition. Elevated IOP is one of the primary risk factors for glaucoma, although it is important to note that not all individuals with high IOP will develop glaucoma, and some people may develop glaucoma even with normal IOP.\n\nThere are different types of tonometers available, but most are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The specific method used may vary depending on the equipment and technique employed by the eye care professional.\n\nOne common type of tonometry is called applanation tonometry, which involves gently touching the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) with a small probe or device. This allows for an accurate measurement of IOP based on how much force is needed to flatten a small area of the cornea.\n\nAnother type is non-contact tonometry, also known as air-puff tonometry. In this method, a quick puff of air is directed towards the cornea while a sensor measures changes in reflection or indentation caused by the air puff. This provides an estimation of IOP without physically touching the eye.\n\nOverall, tonometry serves as an essential tool for evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma because it allows eye care professionals to measure intraocular pressure accurately. However, it's important to note that other factors such as family history, optic nerve health, visual field tests, and overall clinical assessment are also taken into consideration when assessing an individual's risk of glaucoma.\n\nTonometry . The pressure in your eyes (intraocular pressure, or IOP) is measured using a technique called tonometry. Tonometry measures your IOP by determining how your cornea responds when an instrument (or sometimes a puff of air) presses on the surface of your eye. Eye drops are used to numb the surface of your eye for this test.\nGonioscopy . For this test, your eye doctor inspects your eye’s drainage angle-the area where fluid drains out of your eye. During gonioscopy, you sit in a chair facing the microscope used to look inside your eye. You will place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar while looking straight ahead. The goniolens is placed lightly on the front of your eye, and a narrow beam of light is directed into your eye while your doctor looks through the slit lamp at the drainage angle. Drops will be used to numb the eye before the test.\nOphthalmoscopy . With this test, your eye doctor can evaluate whether or not there is any optic nerve damage by looking at the back of the eye (called the fundus). There are two types of ophthalmoscopy: direct and indirect. With direct ophthalmoscopy, your ophthalmologist uses a small flashlight-like instrument with several lenses that magnifies up to about 15 times. This type of ophthalmoscopy is most commonly done during a routine physical examination. With indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ophthalmologist wears a headband with a light attached and uses a small handheld lens to look inside your eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy allows a better view of the fundus, even if your natural lens is clouded by cataracts.\nVisual field test . The peripheral (side) vision of each eye is tested with visual field testing, or perimetry. For this test, you sit at a bowl-shaped instrument called a perimeter. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights will flash off and on. Each time you see a flash, you press a button. A computer records your response to each flash. This test shows if you have any areas of loss of side vision. Loss of peripheral vision is often an early sign of glaucoma.\nPhotography . Sometimes photographs or other computerized images are taken of the optic nerve to inspect the nerve more closely for damage from elevated pressure in the eye.\nSpecial imaging . Different scanners may be used to better determine the configuration of the optic nerve head or retinal nerve fiber layer.\nGlaucoma has to do with the pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP) . When the aqueous humor (a clear liquid that normally flows in and out of the eye) cannot drain properly, pressure builds up in the eye. The resulting increase in IOP can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.\nThe most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma , in which the aqueous fluid is blocked from flowing back out of the eye at a normal rate through a tiny drainage system. Most people who develop primary open-angle glaucoma notice no symptoms until their vision is impaired.\nOcular hypertension is often a forerunner to actual open-angle glaucoma. When intraocular pressure is above normal, the risk of developing glaucoma increases. Several risk factors will affect whether you will develop glaucoma, including the level of IOP, family history, and the corneal thickness. If your risk is high, your eye doctor may recommend treatment to lower your IOP to prevent future damage.\nIn angle-closure glaucoma , the iris (the colored part of the eye) may drop over and completely close off the drainage angle, abruptly blocking the flow of aqueous fluid and leading to increased IOP and optic nerve damage. In acute angle-closure glaucoma there is a sudden increase in IOP due to the buildup of aqueous fluid. This condition is considered an emergency because optic nerve damage and vision loss can occur within hours of the problem. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, seeing halos around lights, and eye pain.\nEven some people with “normal” IOP can experience vision loss from glaucoma. This condition is called normal-tension glaucoma . In this type of glaucoma, the optic nerve is damaged even though the IOP is considered normal. Normal-tension glaucoma is not well understood, but lowering IOP has been shown to slow progression of this form of glaucoma.\nYour eye doctor may tell you that you are at risk for glaucoma if you have one or more risk factors, including having an elevated IOP, a family history of glaucoma, certain optic nerve conditions, are of a particular ethnic background, or are of advanced age. Regular examinations with your eye doctor are important if you are at risk for this condition.\nThe goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower your eye pressure to prevent or slow further vision loss. Your doctor will recommend treatment if the risk of vision loss is high. Treatment often consists of eye drops but can include laser treatment or surgery to create a new drain in the eye. Glaucoma is a chronic disease that can be controlled but not cured. Ongoing monitoring (every three to six months) is needed to watch for changes. Ask your eye doctor if you have any questions about glaucoma or your treatment.\nA variety of methods can be used to check the intraocular pressure, but the most common are applanation tonometry and pneumotonometry. Your eye doctor will often set a “target” pressure for you and will adjust the treatment to keep the pressure close to or below that target to help preserve your vision.\nEarly in the disease process of glaucoma, individual nerve fibers in the eye’s optic nerve are lost, causing an associated pattern of nerve-fiber-layer thinning. This problem can later translate into loss of tissue at the optic nerve head, resulting in visual field defects and, ultimately, loss of vision.\nNew techniques have been devised to help measure the thickness of the nerve fiber layer, helping eye doctors diagnose glaucoma earlier and monitor progression of the disease.\nOne technique used to measure the nerve fiber layer is called scanning laser polarimetry , which utilizes a device called a GDx scanner. Another technique uses a low-power laser light and a process called optical coherence tomography (OCT) . These new imaging techniques can help provide an objective measurement of the nerve fiber layer, enhancing the ability to effectively diagnose and monitor glaucoma.\nBoth tests are done in the doctor’s office. During these tests, the patient is required only to remain still while the image is scanned.\nPigmentary dispersion syndrome is a condition in which increased amounts of pigment circulate within the front portion of the eye. This often results in having pigment layered on the back of the cornea, thinning of the iris, and clogging of the ocular drainage system with pigment. This pigment can block the drainage channel enough to cause an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) .\nIn cases of pigmentary glaucoma, the IOP often is very high, reaching levels above 40. Pigmentary dispersion leads to damage from glaucoma in 20% to 50% of patients. It is more common in males and often appears in people under 50 years of age.\nPseudoexfoliation glaucoma is a relatively common form of open-angle glaucoma that can cause significantly high eye pressures. This condition is marked by a dust-like material that is observed inside the eye on the surface of the iris and lens. This material can clog the ocular drainage system, increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) . It can occur in one or both eyes and is most commonly seen in patients over the age of 70. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is found in all ethnic groups, but it is most commonly seen in people of Scandinavian ancestry.\nTreatment is often required for pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, consisting of medication, laser treatment, or surgery. Pseudoexfoliation can cause increased complications with cataract surgery. With proper treatment and monitoring, patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma tend to do well. Early diagnosis is important.\nIf your eye is injured, there is a chance you will develop traumatic glaucoma. A direct blow to the eye can cause bleeding or inflammation in the eye, which may lead to an acute rise in eye pressure. This condition can typically be managed with eye drop medication. However, if the intraocular pressure (IOP) is very high or if blood remains in the eye, surgical treatment may be required.\nIf an eye is hit hard enough to cause bleeding in the front part of the eye, this is called a hyphema . A hyphema increases the possibility of a rise in eye pressure. Various medications can bring the pressure down to a safe zone until the blood decreases or disappears.\nIn cases of a hyphema, there is also a chance of a future increase in eye pressure. The chance of developing elevated eye pressure and glaucoma following a hyphema is thought to be approximately 8% over a patient’s lifetime. Therefore, anyone who has had eye trauma should be sure to have intraocular pressure checks every year. If your eye doctor notes an increase in your eye pressure, he or she can find ways to control it.\nOne particular test, called a visual field test (also called perimetry ), measures all areas of your eyesight, including your side, or peripheral, vision. A visual field test can help find certain patterns of vision loss and is a key way to check for glaucoma. It is very useful in finding early changes in vision caused by nerve damage from glaucoma.\nTo take this painless test, you sit at a bowl-shaped instrument called a perimeter . While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights flash. Each time you see a flash you press a button. A computer records the location of each flash and whether you pressed the button when the light flashed in that location. At the end of the test, a printout shows if there are areas of your field of vision where you did not see the flashes of light. This test shows if you have any areas of vision loss. Loss of peripheral vision (also known as side vision ) is often an early sign of glaucoma. Regular perimetry tests are an important technique for learning how, if at all, your vision is changing over time. It can also be used to see if treatment for glaucoma is preventing further vision loss.\n\nQuestion: In which occupation would you rotate the gog at the end of your nose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population. Various codes of football were played in New Zealand in the years following white settlement. Christchurch Football Club, which is now the oldest rugby club in the country, was founded in 1863. It played by its own rules for many years. Rugby football was first introduced to New Zealand in 1870 by Charles John Monro, son of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro. He \n\n In all codes of rugby, a player may be temporarily suspended for a period of the match. In rugby union and rugby league, the standard suspension period is 10 minutes (out of an 80-minute game). This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the sin bin and is signaled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a yellow card (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union. In rugby union sevens, which normally lasts 14 minutes (20 in finals), the suspension period is 2 minutes. While eight minutes shorter than in fifteens, suspensions \n\n  Rugby Fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with Winchester Fives (a form of Wessex Fives) and Eton Fives. It is played mainly in the United Kingdom. It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex Fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, famous Headmaster of Rugby School, who had played Wessex Fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth's Grammar, now Warminster School. The open court of Wessex Fives, built in 1787, is still in existence and use at Warminster School. An early mention of the game can be found in the novel Tom Brown's School Days (1857) by Thomas Hughes. The author attended Rugby School during the period when Dr Arnold was Headmaster. The game is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a 'bar' across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.\n\n American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points. What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton, two college teams. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the \n\nThis is a summary of the sports that are part of the Paralympic Games – what are the modifications, the classes of disability that are relevant for each competition. After each section there is a link to the official London 2012 video presentation.\nAmputee (ALA): Athletes with a partial or total loss of at least one limb.\nCerebral Palsy (CP): Athletes with non-progressive brain damage, for example cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke or similar disabilities affecting muscle control, balance or coordination.\nIntellectual Disability (ID): Athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behavior.\nWheelchair (WC): Athletes with spinal cord injuries and other disabilities that require them to compete in a wheelchair.\nVisually Impaired (VI): Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment and the athlete with visual impairment are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.\nLes Autres (part of ALA) :Athletes with a physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other five categories, such as dwarfism, multiple sclerosis or congenital deformities of the limbs such as that caused by thalidomide.\nW2 – athletes with paraplegia or a comparable impairment (with limited mobility in the lower limbs and full arm function).\nW1 & W2 compete in a wheelchair.\nF52-F58 – other physical impairments.\nBoccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. All events are mixed gender. The aim of the game is to throw leather balls – coloured red or blue (which side gets which is determined by a coin toss) – as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. The jack is thrown first, then the first two regular balls are played, (first, the player who threw the jack then the opposing side), after which, the side furthest away from the jack goes next in an attempt to either get closer to the jack or knock the opposition’s ball out of the way. In this fashion, each end will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with hands, feet, or, if the competitor’s disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. The team/player with the highest number of points at the end of play is the winner. If both teams have the same amount of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner.\nThe number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). Team competition is six ends, and six balls per team per end (two per player). Boccia is played on a court measuring 12.5 × 6 m with 2 m of empty space around it. The surface of the court is flat and smooth. The throwing area is divided into six rectangular throwing boxes in which the athletes must stay completely within during play. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid.\nBC1 – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside of the competitor’s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested.\nEquestrian consists of dressage events.Riders were given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows riders to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nFor each of the events below, medals were contested for one or more of the above classifications. After each classification are given the dates that the event was contested. All events were mixed, meaning that men and women competed together.\nThis is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments. Teams have five players, including the goalkeeper. Teams may also use one guide, who is positioned off the field of play, to assist in directing players. The ball is equipped with a noise-making device to allow players to locate it by sound. Matches consist of two 25-minute halves. Three classes of athletes – B1 (totally or almost totally bind) and B2&B3 (partially sighted). For Class B2/B3 games, teams can field players in sport classes B2 and B3; at least two B2 players must be on the field at all times.\nC8 – minimally disabled athletes.\nGoalball is a team sport designed for blind athletes. Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball that has bells embedded in it into the opponents’ goal. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the bell to judge the position and movement of the ball. Games consist of two 12 minute halves (formerly 10 minute halves). Blindfolds allow partially sighted players to compete on an equal footing with blind players. Up to three substitutes are allowed in addition to the three starting players: one Center and two Wingers. Men and women compete separately.\nParalympic judo is an adaptation of the Japanese martial art of judo for visually impaired competitors. Paralympic judo competition has rules with some modifications specified by the International Blind Sports Association (IBSA). The major rule difference is that contests always start with the 2 competitors in a loose grip on each others Judo suits (grip called “Kumikata”) and if contact is broken, “matte”(Wait), or stop, is called and the competitors return to center and regrip.\nParalympic powerlifting is an adaptation of the sport of powerlifting for athletes with disabilities. The only discipline in Paralympic powerlifting is the bench press. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee and is open to anyone with a minimum level of disability who can extend their arms within 20° of full extension during a lift. Powerlifting has been competed at the Summer Paralympics since 1984.\nRacing is held over 1,000 m (rather than the standard 2,000 m). In mixed events half the crew must be male and other half female (coxswain maybe of either gender and may be able bodied). Single shells for the Arms and Shoulders category must have stabilising pontoons attached to the riggers.\nSH3 – Blind Shooters (sights seek sound-emitting targets).\nSub-classifications A, B and C define wheelchair backrest height depending on back and pelvic strength per athlete. Disabled shooters use exactly the same guns and clothing as able-bodied shooters. There are adaptations like the use of a shooting chair for competitors unable to stand, also a shooting table for events like kneeling or prone. he only additional event is the 10m air rifle prone which is shot with both male and female shooters mixed. Both sexes shooting 60 shots within 1 hour 30 minutes.\nThe majority of rules for Paralympic swimming are the same as those for able-bodied competitions. Significant differences include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in able-bodied swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called “tappers” stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. Competitors in these events are required to wear blackened goggles, so that partially sighted swimmers compete at an even level with those who are totally blind.\nSwimmers with physical disabilities are allocated a category between 1 and 10, with 1 corresponding to the most severe types of disability. Physical disabilities of Paralympic swimmers include single or multiple limb loss (through birth defects and/or amputation), cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries (leading to paralysis or disability in limb coordination), dwarfism, and disabilities which impair the use of joints. Blind and visually impaired swimmers compete within separate categories, being allocated to categories 11, 12 or 13. Category 11 corresponds to totally blind swimmers, while competitors in category 13 have severe but not total visual impairment. Swimmers with mental disabilities compete in category 14. Numbers are combined with a letter prefix depending on the event type. An “S” prefix corresponds to freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, while “SB” corresponds to breaststroke and “SM” to the medley.\nParalympic table tennis is asport which follows the standard rules with slight modifications for wheelchair athletes. Athletes from all disability groups can take part. Athletes receive classifications between 1-10. Class 1-5 are for those in wheelchairs and class 6-10 for those who have disabilities that allow them to play standing. Within those groups the higher classification means the more function the athlete has. The usual table tennis rules are in effect with the only rule difference being that the serve must cross the back of the table before it crosses the sides of the table.\nIn sitting volleyball, the net is about 3 feet high, and the court is 10 x 6 meters with a 2-meter attack line. Players are allowed to block serves, but one “cheek” must be in contact with the floor whenever they make contact with the ball. In standing volleyball, a mix of disabilities must be represented on the court at all time to equalize the level of play. Athletes with the following disabilities can compete in sitting or standing volleyball: Amputees, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, brain injuries and stroke. There are no athlete classifications by disability.\nWheelchair basketball is basketball played by people in wheelchairs and is considered one of the major disabled sports practiced. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people play wheelchair basketball from recreation to club play and as elite national team members. Wheelchair basketball retains most major rules and scoring of basketball and is played at standard basketball court. Some exceptions – “travelling” in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches his wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again. All teams use a classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. Minimally disabled athletes are classified as a 4.5, and an individual with the highest degree of disability (such as a paraplegic with a complete injury below the chest) would have the classification of 1.0. he five players from each team on the court during play may not exceed a total of 14 points.\nWheelchair rugby is mostly played by two teams of up to twelve players. Only four players from each team may be on the court at any time. It is a mixed gender sport, and both male and female athletes play on the same teams. Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a hardwood court of the same measurements as a regulation basketball court — 28 metres long by 15 metres wide. The goal lineis the section of the end line within the key. For a goal to count, two wheels of the player’s wheelchair must cross the line while the player has possession of the ball. Offensive players are not permitted to remain in the opposing team’s key for more than ten seconds. A player with possession of the ball must bounce or pass the ball within ten seconds. Teams have twelve seconds to advance the ball from their back court into the front court and a total of forty seconds to score a point or concede possession. Physical contact between wheelchairs is permitted, and forms a major part of the game. Wheelchair rugby games consist of four eight-minute quarters.\nThis is one of the forms of tennis adapted for those who have disabilities in their lower bodies. The size of courts, balls, and rackets are same, but there are two major differences f- they use specially designed wheelchairs and the ball may bounce up to two times. The second bounce may also occur outside of the field. There are three categories; Men, Ladies, and Quads and each category has singles and doubles tournaments. Quads is the category for those with quadriplegia and it is sometimes called Mixed especially at Paralympic Games. Quads players can hold rackets taped to the hand and use electric-powered wheelchairs.\n\nQuestion: What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Grand National steeplechase was first run at Aintree in 1837. Between 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished. One of the first Welsh language journals, Yr Amserau, was founded in Liverpool by William Rees (Gwilym Hiraethog), and there were over 50 Welsh chapels in the city. Early regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) and Collins Line and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines Cunard Line and White Star Line continuing throughout the 19th Century. When the American Civil War broke out \n\n The Rocket train. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. The built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The Bluecoat Hospital for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only St Nicholas Church and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and Paradise Street following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with \n\n During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. Although the tunnel scheme was not realised by this railway company, the route operated services between and  via, with the dedicated express track beginning at  in Nottinghamshire. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\n The Sankey Viaduct is a railway viaduct in North West England. It is a designated Grade I listed building and has been described as being \"the earliest major railway viaduct in the world\". In 1826, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company (L&MR) was authorised to construct the world's first intercity railway. One obstacle on the selected 50 km route between Liverpool and Manchester was the Sankey Valley. The company's principal engineer, George Stephenson, designed the Sankey Viaduct for the double-track railway to traverse the valley and Sankey Canal with sufficient clearance for the masts and sails of the Mersey flats that used the canal. The viaduct was built between 1828 and 1830, although work on the structure did not finish until the middle of 1833. On 15 September 1830, the viaduct was opened along with the Liverpool & Manchester railway. During 2015, Network Rail installed overhead line equipment as part of a wider electrification programme.\n\n Scientific Revolution from the 17th century. As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, best known for the creation of the Great Western Railway, a series of famous steamships, and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering. Thomas Newcomen's steam engine helped spawn the Industrial Revolution. The Father of Railways, George Stephenson, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of the steam engine, and \n\nQuestion: The age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of the Liverpool-Manchester line?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The National Theatre's production of Frankenstein returned to cinema screens worldwide for a limited season in June, July and December 2012, as well as for encore screenings in October and November 2013. A third encore screening was announced, beginning 25 October 2014. It was seen for around 800,000 people on cinemas. Another encore screening was made across the United States on 22 and 29 October 2018 in honour of the novel's 200th anniversary, so viewers could see both actors play both roles. The films were made available as part of the National Theatre's NT at Home series for a week from 30 April 2020, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the creature available starting from 30 April, and Jonny Lee Miller as the creature starting from 1 May.\n\n censorship issues. It was allegedly cut down to only 39 minutes. This is now considered a lost film, with only some production stills and promotional material remaining. It is believed the film disappeared soon after its initial release because it was so heavily edited, little of interest to audiences remained. Producer Albertini, also a well-known Italian actor in his day, played the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein in this version. In 1924, he moved to America and starred in a Hollywood film called The Iron Man, but afterwards moved back to Italy to resume his acting career there. He was confined to a mental institution later in life, where he died in 1945.\n\n Frankenstein is a stage adaptation by Nick Dear of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Its world premiere was at the Royal National Theatre on 5 February 2011, where it officially opened on 22 February. This production was directed by Danny Boyle with a cast including Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, with the two lead actors alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. Frankenstein ended its run on 2 May 2011.\n\n In this film, Victor clones himself instead of creating the creature from the dead. In this adaptation, Victor and the monster share a psychic link, and can sense each other's presence. ; Kenneth Branagh reinterpreted the character along the lines of Shelley's portrayal in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) opposite Robert De Niro as the monster. ; In the 1999 animated film Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein is the main antagonist voiced by Michael Bell.

Food stores are not found in nests collected in the field, neither are they found in colonies raised in laboratory observation nests. This implies that any food brought into the nest is directly fed to nestmates and larvae.\n\n micro-filtration processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision. Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose. Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs). Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds, which consume insects as a primary food source. Selective toxicity, controlled application, and \n\n of the weight of the individuals and perform important roles in the digestion of lignocellulose and nitrogen fixation.

Bacterial communities associated with insects like termites and cockroaches are determined by a combination of forces, primarily diet, but there is some indication that host phylogeny may also be playing a role in the selection of lineages.

As it stings its prey, it releases a toxin into the victim's neural nodes. This toxin blocks the cockroach's octopamine receptors, leaving the cockroach alive, but docile and with impaired motility. By prodding with its antennae, the predator then escorts its victim into the wasp's nest, where it can be dispatched more easily.\n\n The brown cockroach (Periplaneta brunnea) is a species of cockroach in the family Blattidae. It is probably originally native to Africa, but today it has a circumtropical distribution, having been widely introduced. In cooler climates it can only survive indoors, and it is considered a household pest. This cockroach is similar in appearance to the American cockroach (P. americana), but darker in color and with thicker, wider, triangular cerci. It is a reddish-brown color and has fully developed wings. It reaches up to 4 centimeters in length. It produces an ootheca about 1.2 to 1.6 centimeters long containing about 24 eggs on average.

None of Holiday's songs placed on the modern pop charts, partly because Billboard only published the first ten slots of the charts in some issues. Minor hits and independent releases had no way of being spotlighted. \"God Bless the Child\", which went on to sell over a million copies, ranked number 3 on Billboards year-end top songs of 1941. On October 24, 1942, Billboard began issuing its R&B charts. Two of Holiday's songs placed on the chart, \"Trav'lin' Light\" with Paul Whiteman, which topped the chart, and \"Lover Man\", which reached number 5. \"Trav'lin' Light\" also reached 18 on Billboards year-end chart.\n\n Christmas Music is a compilation album of phonograph records put together for the Christmas season by Decca Records in late 1940. The album features the most popular artists recording for Decca such as: Bing Crosby, Kenny Baker, Men About Town and Eddie Dunstedter.

The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil. The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. Those who had sinned went to the deepest pit, Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks.

It was initially separated from the Greek underworld and realm of Hades, and only mortals related to the gods and other heroes could be admitted here. Later, the conception of who could enter was expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic. They would remain at the Elysian Fields after death, to live a blessed and happy life, and indulge in whatever employment they had enjoyed in life. The Elysian Fields were, according to Homer, located on the western edge of the Earth by \n\n similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as Pluto. In the ancient Greek myth about the Labours of Heracles, the hero Heracles had to travel to the underworld to capture Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks. In Dream of Scipio, Cicero describes what seems to be an out of body experience, of the soul traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away. In Book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, the hero, Aeneas, travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them.

Hippolytus of Rome pictures the underworld (Hades) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the bosom of Abraham their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the \"lake of unquenchable fire\" into which they are destined to be cast. Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death. Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by Gregory of Nyssa that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of \"purgatorial flames\". \n\n The Greek god Hades is known in Greek mythology as the king of the underworld, a place where souls live after death. The Greek god Hermes, the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades).

TEA\n\n_Camellia sinensis_\n\nNext to water, tea is the most highly consumed beverage in the world. The tea plant is a member of the Theaceae family. It is an evergreen shrub or tree that may grow several feet tall, but is usually pruned to 2 to 5 feet when cultivated. The leaves are dark green with serrated edges, and the tree bears white, fragrant blossoms. Three types of tea—oolong, black, and green—are produced from the leaves of the tea plant, depending on the processing technique. Oolong tea is partially fermented, black tea is completely fermented, and green tea is not fermented. Oolong and green tea are closely related and have been used medicinally for a variety of conditions, including diabetes. USES\n\nMedicinally, tea is used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease, cancer, and obesity. It is also used to promote mental alertness, protect against solar radiation, improve dental health, and prevent aging. Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects. Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Although closely related, oolong and green tea differ in their caffeine and polyphenol content.Recent evidence indicates that regularly drinking six or more cups a day of green tea may lower your risk of developing of type 2 diabetes.Some of the ingredients in tea are thought to enhance insulin activity, which may be responsible for some of the benefit in diabetes.\n\n Both green and black tea are popular around the world, and have historically been associated with health benefits, though this is not currently supported by scientific research. While they differ in color and taste, they both contain antioxidants and caffeine. Green tea has a wider range of antioxidants, many of which have tentatively been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, but black tea has more caffeine, which is associated with boosting brain function.\n\n  Black tea, also translated to red tea in various Asian languages, is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Two principal varieties of the species are used – the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced. First \n\n in China, the beverage's name there is hong cha (, \"red tea\") due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately. Today, the drink is widespread throughout East and Southeast Asia, both in consumption and harvesting, including in Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Singapore. Similar variants are also available in South Asian countries. While green tea usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea retains its flavor for several years. For this reason, it has long been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century.\n\n Tea is a beverage made by steeping processed leaves, buds, or twigs of the plant Camellia sinensis in hot water for a few minutes. The processing can include oxidation (called \"fermentation\" in the tea industry), heating, drying and the addition of herbs, flowers, spices and fruits. There are four main types of tea: black, oolong, green, and white.

He was often depicted with a legend such as \"USE ZIP CODE\" in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps. Mr. ZIP was featured prominently alongside musical group \"The Swingin' Six\" in a variety show that the post office used to explain the importance of using ZIP codes. In 1971, Elmira (NY) Star-Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a ZIP Code on its envelopes. Herb Klein, special assistant to President Nixon, responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the ZIP Code.\n\n In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called \"plus-four codes\", \"add-on codes\", or \"add-ons\". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, the new format was not adopted universally by the public; it eventually became obsolete with modern technology. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address—along with the even more specific delivery point—and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to \n\n  The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district/zone numbers. The United States Post Office Department (USPOD) implemented postal zones for many large cities in 1943. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized. An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, \n\n all major US cities (implemented USPOD-wide) until World War II. By 1930 or earlier the idea of extending postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\". Modern postal codes were first introduced in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1932, but the system was abandoned in 1939. The next country to introduce postal codes was Germany in 1941, followed by Singapore in 1950, Argentina in 1958, the United States in 1963 and Switzerland in 1964. The United Kingdom began introducing its current system in Norwich in 1959, but they were not used nationwide until 1974.\n\n  A ZIP Code is a postal code used by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Introduced in 1963, the basic format consisted of five digits. In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997.\n\nQuestion: In which decade were ZIP codes introduced in the USA?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The victim is usually said to be a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts. In some cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: \"Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes \n\n A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and less often young boys. These shapes are not limited by the fox's own age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. Kitsune are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a kitsune. Kitsune-gao ('fox-faced') refers to human \n\n In folk religion, stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. Those possessed by a fox are thought to suffer from a mental illness or similar condition. There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki. These families are said to have been able to use their fox to gain fortune, but marriage into such a family was considered forbidden as it would enlarge the family. They are also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of ones that they hate, and as a result of being considered taboo by the other families, it has led to societal problems. The great amount of faith given to foxes can be seen in how, as a result of the Inari belief where foxes were believed to be Inari no Kami or its servant, they were employed in practices of dakini-ten by mikkyō and shugendō practitioners and in the oracles of miko; the customs related to kitsunetsuki can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.\n\n The following is a list of appearances made by kitsune (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. For information on kitsune in traditional Japanese culture, please see the main article. Embedded in popular folklore as they are, kitsune have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works. A few Western authors have also made use of the kitsune legends. In anime, kitsune are often depicted as kemonomimi, usually as female, seductive, and fond of alcohol. Specific depictions of kitsune include:\n\n In Japanese folklore, Kitsune (狐, キツネ) are intelligent foxes that possess paranormal abilities that increase as they get older and wiser. According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity. Conversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats).\n\nQuestion: What are the shape-shifting foxes of the Japanese folklore?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is the counterpart of the Greek god Poseidon. In the Greek tradition, Neptune is the brother of Jupiter and Pluto; the brothers preside over the realms of heaven, the earthly world, and the underworld. Salacia is his wife. Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics, especially those in North Africa, were influenced by Hellenistic conventions. Neptune was likely associated with freshwater springs before the sea. Like Poseidon, Neptune was also worshipped by the Romans as a god of horses as Neptunus Equester (a patron of horse-racing).\n\n Bull. Her union with the bull produced the Minotaur. ; Pelias: son of Poseidon and Tyro and king of Iolcus. He was the twin brother of Neleus, and played a key role in the story of the Argonauts. He challenged his nephew Jason to sail to Colchis and bring back the legendary Golden Fleece. His daughters were tricked into killing him by Jason's wife Medea. ; Penthesilea: daughter of Ares and Otrera, a Queen of the Amazons. ; Perseus: son of Zeus and mortal princess Danae, whom he impregnated as a golden shower. ; Phaethon: Egyptian son of Helios and Clymene, famous for crashing \n\nPolyidus, a Corinthian seer and descendant of Melampus. ; Polyidus, the Trojan son of Eurydamas and brother of Abas. He was a reader of dreams and an old man at the time of the Trojan War. Polyidus was killed by the Argive hero Diomedes. ; Polyidus, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Dulichium along with other 56 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was shot dead by Odysseus with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus. In Greek mythology, Polyidus ( Polúeidos means 'seeing many things') may refer to three distinct characters. The name also means \"much beauty\", from polus, \"many, much\" and eidos, \"form, appearance, beauty\". \n\n sun chariot. ; Polydeuces, also known by his Roman name of Pollux: one of the Dioscuri and twin brother of Kastor. He was son of Zeus and the mortal Leda while his twin had a mortal father, king Tyndareus (Leda's husband). ; Pyrrha: daughter of Epimetheus and the first woman Pandora. She and her cousin-husband Deucalion repopulated the earth after the Great Flood that ended the Bronze Age. ; Sciron: son of Poseidon, a Corinthian bandit who was defeated by Theseus on his way to Athens. ; Tantalus: son of Zeus and the nymph Plouto, a Lydian king, father of Pelops and Niobe. ; \n\n of 790.931 days (for comparison, trails Dione by 60°). Polydeuces's libration is large enough that it takes on some qualities of a tadpole orbit, as evidenced by the clear asymmetry between excursions towards and away from Dione. In the course of one such cycle, Polydeuces's orbital radius also varies by about ± 7660 km with respect to Dione's. The name Polydeuces was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005. In Greek mythology, Polydeuces is another name for Pollux, twin brother of Castor, son of Zeus and Leda.
