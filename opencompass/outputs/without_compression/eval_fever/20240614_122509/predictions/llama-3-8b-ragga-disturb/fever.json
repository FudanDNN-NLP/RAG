Johansson learned some Russian from a former teacher on the phone for her role as Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film received mainly positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.  \n\n assistant professor of dance at both York University and George Brown College. In the early 1950s Leigh danced during the summer season with the Toronto Theatre Ballet. She appeared in a leading role in the film The Other Man. Leigh's own choreography included works for the National Ballet School, the Canadian Opera Company and Ontario Ballet Theatre. Her second marriage was to Canadian film-maker Paul Almond. Leigh had one daughter, Stephanie Leigh, also a dancer and pedagogue. In 2003 Leigh helped found Ballet Victoria, the first professional ballet company on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. At the time of her death on November 30, 2004 she was the company's artistic adviser.\n\n Leigh-Hunt was born in Bath, Somerset. On stage, she has appeared in many productions as well those with the Bristol Old Vic, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre. Her early film roles have included Catherine Parr in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972), Bequest to the Nation (1973) and Oh Heavenly Dog (1980). Her most famous movie role is probably in Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy (1972), as a woman raped and strangled by a serial killer, that included the first graphically violent scene featuring visible nudity of Hitchcock's career. In 1983 Leigh-Hunt appeared as the Queen of Bavaria in the mini-series Wagner, sharing her scenes with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud as court ministers. Richard Burton played the composer Richard \n\n In 1962, she starred in the thriller The Manchurian Candidate, before deciding to scale back her career. Leigh continued to appear in films intermittently throughout the 1960s, with roles in Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Harper (1966).

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\".  It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting.\n\nIn 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.\n\nAccolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.\n\nSee also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\nDead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists.

        "context": "Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance.\n\nA second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.\n\nAdaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\".\n\nIt is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\".

A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an \n\nThe main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). When we exercise, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients to support their increased activity. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. \n\nOne of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. This increase in heart rate leads to an increase in the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction, which ultimately results in an increase in cardiac output.\n\nBy increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise. This mechanism allows the body to maintain an optimal level of performance and support the increased physical activity.\n\nIt's important to note that while increased heart rate is the main reason for the rise in cardiac output during exercise, other factors such as stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) can also contribute to the overall increase in cardiac output. The intricacies of these factors work together to meet the enhanced demand of the body during physical exertion.\n\nThe ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. These parameters include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.\n\nHeart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles. Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tend to have lower resting heart rates and can achieve higher exercise intensities before reaching their maximum heart rate.\n\nStroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles.\n\nCardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate. As both stroke volume and heart rate increase with cardiovascular fitness, cardiac output also increases. This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is a measure of an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles.\n\nImprovements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. Increased general metabolism leads to enhanced muscle metabolism and improved utilization of energy sources during exercise. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. Venous return improves due to adaptations in blood vessels, enhancing the return of blood to the heart. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.\n\nTo optimize oxygen delivery to working muscles, individuals should engage in metabolic training, which includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.\n\nOverall, a person's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles is influenced by various physiological parameters that are closely tied to cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise and training can lead to improvements in these parameters, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery and improved performance during physical activities.\n\nReference:\n- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/\n\n Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.\n\nThe body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.\nThe acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise.\nImmediately during the start of exercise, the cardiac output (Q) increases because of an increase in stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped in liters per minute, and is the product of stroke volume and heart rate: [Q = SV x HR]. Obviously, the heart rate increases during exercise, but most people don't realize that it actually starts to pick up right before the start of exercise as a reflex. The sympathetic nervous system sends an anticipatory stimulation to get the heart ready for exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. Stroke volume can increase up to 50% - 60% of the resting value.\nOxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands. At rest, VO2 is 1 met = 3.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum value for VO2 can be anywhere between 25 - 80 mL/kg/min, depending on age and conditioning level.\nThere is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the heart's contraction, and should increase during exercise. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. However, diastolic blood pressure should never increase over 20 mmHg.\nDuring exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization.\nRespiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. Minute ventilation increases through an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled per breath. Essentially this means that you breathe deeper and faster during exercise. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs.\nAfter long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands.\nThe changes to the cardiovascular system include increased maximal cardiac output (Qmax), increased stroke volume (SV), and reduced heart rate (HR) at rest and during sub maximal exercise. There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.\nThe maximum cardiac output increases as a result of stroke volume increasing a very significant amount. The increase in stroke volume is achieved from increases in the heart's contractility, elasticity, and chamber volume, as well as an increase in the thickness of the left ventricle, which is the space that holds blood before it's pumped out into the arteries to deliver oxygen and other nutrients. Therefore, the heart can literally fill up with more blood before each beat, at both rest and during exercise.\nThe increase in stroke volume allows resting heart rate to decrease. If the heart is pumping more blood per beat at rest, it doesn't have to pump as frequently to meet the same resting cardiac output demands. Highly conditioned athletes, for example, have resting heart rates ranging from 40-60 bpm, compared to the average person's resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm.\nThe more advanced capillary functions ultimately allow more efficiently delivered oxygen, nutrients, and hormones, as well as an increased means for the removal of heat and metabolic byproducts.\nRespiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. If the training focuses on the lower extremities, such as running, its unlikely that you will see any adaptations during upper extremity exercises.\nIf the athlete is training at a maximal level, then there will be an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the volume of air displaced with each full respiratory cycle (inhale and exhale).\nAfter long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms.\nThe build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. Because there are better mechanisms for getting rid of contractile byproducts that end up slowing down muscle contractions, the neural pathways remain un-obstructed for longer.\nThe muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity.\nAerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned.\nThe onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) occurs at a higher percentage of aerobic capacity. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction.\nAll of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery.\nChronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. The muscle fiber cellular changes all contribute to increased muscle efficiency: increased myoglobin levels, mitochondrial size and number, aerobic enzymes, and metabolic energy stores (ATP, PCr, glycogen, and triglycerides).

        "context": " Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an \n\nThe main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). When we exercise, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients to support their increased activity. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. \n\nOne of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. This increase in heart rate leads to an increase in the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction, which ultimately results in an increase in cardiac output.\n\nBy increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise. This mechanism allows the body to maintain an optimal level of performance and support the increased physical activity.\n\nIt's important to note that while increased heart rate is the main reason for the rise in cardiac output during exercise, other factors such as stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) can also contribute to the overall increase in cardiac output. The intricacies of these factors work together to meet the enhanced demand of the body during physical exertion.\n\nThe ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. These parameters include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.\n\nHeart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles. Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tend to have lower resting heart rates and can achieve higher exercise intensities before reaching their maximum heart rate.\n\nStroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles.\n\nCardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate. As both stroke volume and heart rate increase with cardiovascular fitness, cardiac output also increases. This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is a measure of an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles.\n\nImprovements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. Increased general metabolism leads to enhanced muscle metabolism and improved utilization of energy sources during exercise. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. Venous return improves due to adaptations in blood vessels, enhancing the return of blood to the heart. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.\n\nTo optimize oxygen delivery to working muscles, individuals should engage in metabolic training, which includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.\n\nOverall, a person's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles is influenced by various physiological parameters that are closely tied to cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise and training can lead to improvements in these parameters, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery and improved performance during physical activities.\n\nReference:\n- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/\n\n Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.\n\nThe body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.\nThe acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise.\nImmediately during the start of exercise, the cardiac output (Q) increases because of an increase in stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped in liters per minute, and is the product of stroke volume and heart rate: [Q = SV x HR]. Obviously, the heart rate increases during exercise, but most people don't realize that it actually starts to pick up right before the start of exercise as a reflex. The sympathetic nervous system sends an anticipatory stimulation to get the heart ready for exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. Stroke volume can increase up to 50% - 60% of the resting value.\nOxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands. At rest, VO2 is 1 met = 3.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum value for VO2 can be anywhere between 25 - 80 mL/kg/min, depending on age and conditioning level.\nThere is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the heart's contraction, and should increase during exercise. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. However, diastolic blood pressure should never increase over 20 mmHg.\nDuring exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported.

She then studied for two years at Indiana University Bloomington before transferring to Marymount Manhattan College in New York City, where she switched from dancing (specifically classical ballet) to acting. During her first season on Orange Is the New Black, she was still appearing at a restaurant on the Lower East Side as a drag queen (where she had applied initially to work as a waitress).\n\n Portrayed by Sophia Bush since the series' second episode, Brooke Penelope Baker, née Davis, was originally an immature party girl, who was neglected by her parents. She is introduced as Peyton Sawyer's best friend, but forms a close bond with Haley and Lucas (also her ex) who all help her evolve into a better person. After being betrayed by Lucas and Peyton twice she loses her will to love and enter relationships. Although she later forgives them and remains best friends with the two, she does not fall in love again until six years later when she met Julian Baker. \n\n Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal as Izzie Stevens' mother on Grey's Anatomy.

In conventional medicine treatment is designed to decrease the inflammation and avoid re-injures.\nThe patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines.\nOver-the-counter or prescription of anti-inflammatory medications can help temporarily, but can cause side effects also. Prolonged use of the medicines causes significant gastrointestinal upset, ulceration and bleeding. The side effects of steroids injected in the affected area can be serious and can actually worsen symptoms. Complications can include fat necrosis (death of fatty tissue) of the heel and rupture of the plantar fascia.\nSometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. This surgery is about 80 percent effective in the small group of individuals who do not have relief with conservative treatment, but symptoms may return if preventative measures (wearing proper footwear, shoe inserts, stretching, etc) are not maintained.\nIn contrast, homeopathy is a natural form of medicine. In a typical case of healing, a person's complete symptoms will be treated all together.\nWhile prescribing a drug a complete history of the patient is taken which includes the medical history of the patient, physical and mental constitution and genetic predisposition to the disease. A properly prescribed homeopathic remedy can lower the progression of disease and in highly susceptible people can prevent the occurrence or prolong the onset of disease.\nHomeopathy offers a treatment which is safe, gentle and will not end up with side effects. The allopathic medicines might provide immediate relief from the symptoms but the root cause of the problem is not touched upon and the dangerous side effects can be worse than the original symptoms. The treatment works at the deeper level of immunity and enhances the healing capacity of the body. Homeopathy medicines improve the resistance of the body.\nIt helps to reduce the inflammation of the affected area.\nThe remedies helps to reduce the pain in the affected area. Thus reducing the need for strong painkillers.\nIt can save you from a surgeon’s knife.\nThe treatment helps to strengthen your calf muscles so that calf muscles bear the maximum weight of your body.\nIt offers you a promising treatment and you do not have to continue medicines for your whole life. With certain life style changes and homeopathic medications heel pain or heel spur can be treated effectively.\nThere are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. However, the correct choice and the resulting relief is a matter of experience and right judgment on the part of the doctor. The treatment is decided after thorough case taking of the patient. Thus remedies are tailor made unlike allopathy in which all patients receive the same surgery or drugs although trade name may be different.\nA calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. It is caused by putting too much pressure on the sinew on the soles of the feet, usually over a long period of time. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot.\nSpurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the \"bowstring-like\" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel.\nNot all heel spurs cause symptoms. Some are discovered on xrays taken for other purposes. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.\nCalcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Heel spurs are most often seen in middle aged men and women, but can be found in all age groups.\nCalcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot.\nPlantar fasciitis - \"itis\" indicates the inflammation of the tissue (plantar fascia) at the arch of the foot.\nThe causes can range from excessive walking (especially if unaccustomed to walking), running or jumping to improperly fitted or wornout shoes. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily.\nEvery time you take a step, one of your heels has to support the whole weight of your body. As you move, the load is equal to 20 times your own body weight. The load is softened by a pillow of fat under the heel and a large sinew under the sole of the foot.\nIf an athlete does not warm up properly or a person with a sedentary job exercises heavily during the weekends, they might overload the muscles of the calf or the Achilles tendon. These are also fixed on the heel bone. When the muscles of the calf or Achilles tendon are overloaded there will be extra strain on the sinew and muscles in the soles of the foot. The overload can cause inflammation and even small cracks in the sinew.\nEvery time you sit down, sleep or otherwise rest your legs, the muscles of the sole of the foot will contract in an attempt to protect the damaged sinew. The pain in the heel will then no longer be felt. But when you get up again the pain will return and when you move again, the sinew will crack even more. To compensate for the repeated damage to the sinew, the body will try and repair it in the same way that it would attempt to repair a broken bone, namely, by wrapping it up in bone. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. But it is not the spur itself that causes the pain. The spur is the result of a prolonged overload of the sinew at the sole of the foot.\nThough all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The pain is more in the morning and decreases with activity. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. The heel pain arises due to the spur pricking the surrounding tissue. The heel pain has been depicted as toothache in the foot.\nA sharp, stabbing pain under or on the inside of the heel.\nMost sufferers are people who are overweight and middle aged. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective.\nPeople who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Pronated means that the foot tends to roll inwards when a person walks or runs.\nCalcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on.\nOnce a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months.\nPrevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis.\nShoes are a must to support the arch of the foot even when at home. Arch supports and heel cups cushion the heel and reduce the weight bearing on the foot during activities.\nThe intensity and duration of activity and weight bearing should be reduced. Staying off the feet can help a lot.\nThe workout regimen should consist of mild stretches for strengthening of foot and calf muscles so as to reduce the tension on the heel mechanically.\nRolling an ice bottle under the foot can reduce acute pain. In chronic cases heat application also helps reduce the symptoms.\nLosing weight can reduce the extra pressure that plantar fascia bears with every step.\nIt must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs.\n\n Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. The considerations that affect plantar heel pain are the alignment of the foot with lower leg, foot and ankle mobility, strength and endurance of muscle. External influences on plantar heel pain are the amount of time spent on feet while exercising or standing, type of footwear used and type of floor surfaces. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Flat feet can potentially be attributed to the minimal amount of ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of the gait cycle causing more tension on the plantar fascia.\n\n Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray.\n\nCalcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. Initially, these deposits may not have any impact on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity.\n\nThere are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts.\n\nWhile calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. This can lead to persistent pain and difficulty walking or standing for long periods.\n\nIn some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. This can cause discomfort or pain when wearing shoes or participating in activities that involve ankle movement. In such cases, surgical removal of the spur may be considered as part of treatment for insertional Achilles tendonitis.\n\nIt's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.\n\n A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

DreamWorks Animation optioned the book to develop as an animated feature film, to be directed by Guillermo del Toro and Rodrigo Blaas. Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series. Del Toro modeled the show's sensibilities after shows he grew up with such as Jonny Quest, identifying them as \"really earnest and emotionally beautiful\". To this end, he sought to make the main character of Jim \"in that '70s mold,\" and \"really a very good boy\" with del Toro noting that this was a constant struggle for him to express. Eventually he came across Anton Yelchin, who embodied those qualities although by del Toro's estimate it still took him a few sessions to fully understand the character.\n\n Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players control Jim Lake Jr. or Claire Nuñez to prevent the Time-pocalypse. Players also collect artifacts, level up armor and fight fantasy creatures (trolls, dragons and goblins).\n\n Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a video game based on the popular television series Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia. It was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. It was released on September 25, 2020. It was developed by WayForward and published by Outright Games, with European distribution handled through Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n Trollhunters has received critical acclaim and positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 16 reviews for the first season. The website's consensus reads, \"Trollhunters manages to capture del Toro's enthusiasm for telling monster stories, in a youthful and more colorful fashion that may well earn him a new generation of fans.\" On Metacritic, the season has a normalized score of 69 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In 2017, it received six Daytime Emmys, more than any other television program, animated or live action, that year. The second season of Trollhunters was nominated for six Annie Awards, tied for the most nominations of any television program in 2018. It was also nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, including Best Children's Animated Series, and won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. On January 30, 2017, Trollhunters writers Kevin and Dan Hageman stated that the series is the most successful Netflix original show to date that is targeted at a younger audience.\n\n Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American computer-animated fantasy television series created for Netflix by Guillermo del Toro, and produced by DreamWorks Animation and Double Dare You Productions.

Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series. Del Toro modeled the show's sensibilities after shows he grew up with such as Jonny Quest, identifying them as \"really earnest and emotionally beautiful\". To this end, he sought to make the main character of Jim \"in that '70s mold,\" and \"really a very good boy\" with del Toro noting that this was a constant struggle for him to express. Eventually he came across Anton Yelchin, who embodied those qualities although by del Toro's estimate it still took him a few sessions to fully understand the character.\n\n Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players control Jim Lake Jr. or Claire Nuñez to prevent the Time-pocalypse. Players also collect artifacts, level up armor and fight fantasy creatures (trolls, dragons and goblins).\n\n Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a video game based on the popular television series Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia. It was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. It was released on September 25, 2020. It was developed by WayForward and published by Outright Games, with European distribution handled through Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\n Trollhunters has received critical acclaim and positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 16 reviews for the first season. The website's consensus reads, \"Trollhunters manages to capture del Toro's enthusiasm for telling monster stories, in a youthful and more colorful fashion that may well earn him a new generation of fans.\" On Metacritic, the season has a normalized score of 69 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In 2017, it received six Daytime Emmys, more than any other television program, animated or live action, that year. The second season of Trollhunters was nominated for six Annie Awards, tied for the most nominations of any television program in 2018. It was also nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, including Best Children's Animated Series, and won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. On January 30, 2017, Trollhunters writers Kevin and Dan Hageman stated that the series is the most successful Netflix original show to date that is targeted at a younger audience.\n\n Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American computer-animated fantasy television series created for Netflix by Guillermo del Toro, and produced by DreamWorks Animation and Double Dare You Productions.

Soon afterward, he and his friends are charged with protecting the world from the dangerous monsters that lurk in the shadows of their small suburban town. The first two episodes of the series premiered on October 8, 2016, at the New York Comic Con. The first season was released worldwide on Netflix on December 23, 2016.

Written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, it is based on Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book of the same name. It combines live-action, performers in costumes, animatronics, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The film stars Max Records and features the voices of James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Lauren Ambrose, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper. The film centers on a lonely pre-teenage boy named Max who sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the \"Wild Things\", who declare Max their king. In the early 1980s, Disney considered \n\nFinding Dory, Abbey \n\n Reaction to the documentary prompted the bands and singers Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, The Beach Boys, Trace Adkins, and Trisha Yearwood to cancel their concerts at the \"Bands, Brew & BBQ\" event at SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in 2014. The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, \"Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now.\" Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.\n\n Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton with co-direction by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Bob Peterson, David Reynolds, and Stanton from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, and Willem Dafoe. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin who, along with a regal blue tang named Dory, searches for his missing son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself. Released on May 30, 2003, Finding Nemo won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including \n\n Andrew Ayers Stanton (born December 3, 1965) is an American animator, storyboard artist, film director, screenwriter, producer and voice actor based at Pixar, which he joined in 1990.

In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity & Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays. Since 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep, as well as in the Netflix horror series The Haunting of Hill House, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan's follow up to The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Flanagan's mini-series Midnight Mass.

The team tries to determine whether Byrd's generosity is a symptom of mental instability, something confirmed when he offers his other kidney to Thirteen and says he's willing to live on dialysis. Dr. Jessica Adams works with House on a volunteer basis. She and Dr. Park clash over both their diagnoses of the patient and Adams' insistence on giving the proud Park increasingly large gifts, finally paying for House's car repair under the impression that it is Park's car. House reaches out to the retired Thirteen. She aids him on the case and is nearly persuaded to return to the diagnostic team full-time. He then fires her so that she can go to Greece with her new girlfriend guilt-free.\n\n The Boot Street Band was a BBC children comedy television programme which aired for two six-episode seasons in 1993-4.

A contributor of Japanese magazine CD Journal noticed that the R&B composition was a very \"common\" trait in Western culture in the late 1990s. Kano, writing for Rockin'On Japan, agreed, and felt the song infused contemporary soul and club music. The writer commented that their experimentation with R&B music was signfiying to Japanese culture, as he felt the country did not emphasize the genre. Additionally, he noticed the contrast of their \"painful\" yet \"innocent\" vocal range in the number. In a similar review, Mori Tomoyuki from Amazon.com believed that the singers use of R&B \"influence the country\" and other growing musicians.

First editions included a DVD section, with the three music videos from the album's singles, as well as \"Konna ni Chikaku de...\" performed live for a special Nodame orchestra concert at the Tokyo International Forum on February 28, 2007. All Yours was re-released as a \"Winter Special Package\" in November 2007 with a new cover.
