You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Johansson learned some Russian from a former teacher on the phone for her role as Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film received mainly positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.  

 assistant professor of dance at both York University and George Brown College. In the early 1950s Leigh danced during the summer season with the Toronto Theatre Ballet. She appeared in a leading role in the film The Other Man. Leigh's own choreography included works for the National Ballet School, the Canadian Opera Company and Ontario Ballet Theatre. Her second marriage was to Canadian film-maker Paul Almond. Leigh had one daughter, Stephanie Leigh, also a dancer and pedagogue. In 2003 Leigh helped found Ballet Victoria, the first professional ballet company on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. At the time of her death on November 30, 2004 she was the company's artistic adviser.

 Leigh-Hunt was born in Bath, Somerset. On stage, she has appeared in many productions as well those with the Bristol Old Vic, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre. Her early film roles have included Catherine Parr in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972), Bequest to the Nation (1973) and Oh Heavenly Dog (1980). Her most famous movie role is probably in Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy (1972), as a woman raped and strangled by a serial killer, that included the first graphically violent scene featuring visible nudity of Hitchcock's career. In 1983 Leigh-Hunt appeared as the Queen of Bavaria in the mini-series Wagner, sharing her scenes with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud as court ministers. Richard Burton played the composer Richard 

 In 1962, she starred in the thriller The Manchurian Candidate, before deciding to scale back her career. Leigh continued to appear in films intermittently throughout the 1960s, with roles in Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Harper (1966). She began to appear in television frequently in the 1970s, and had roles in such films as Night of the Lepus (1972) and Boardwalk (1979). In 1975, she made her Broadway debut in a production of Murder Among Friends. Leigh subsequently starred in two horror films with her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis: John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998). Her last film role was in the comedy Bad Girls from Valley High, filmed in 2000 and released posthumously. Leigh died in 2004 of vasculitis, aged 77.

 Janet Leigh was an American actress of film, television, stage, and radio, whose career spanned over five decades. Discovered by actress Norma Shearer, Leigh began her career appearing in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including Act of Violence (1948), Little Women (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Scaramouche (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), and Living It Up (1954). In the latter part of the 1950s, Leigh had supporting roles in Safari (1956), and Orson Welles's film noir Touch of Evil (1958). She went on to gain lasting recognition for her portrayal of the doomed Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's horror film Psycho (1960), which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

Production

Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film.

Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said "the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut.

Adaptation as television series
On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role.

Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious".

It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the "50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of "The 25 scariest movies of all time".  It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" by Bloody Disgusting.

In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015.

Box office
The film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $6 million for a worldwide total of $14 million.

Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.

Plot
Twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.

Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.

The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks "Who is this?", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.

His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, Billion Dollar Babies. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show Welcome to My Nightmare alongside guitarist Dick Wagner as seen in the film Welcome to My Nightmare. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show. In 2010, Hunter also worked on the basic tracks and solos for Cooper's album Welcome 2 My Nightmare, touring with Cooper throughout 2011 on the No More Mr. Nice Guy Tour. Steve notched up his ninth Alice Cooper release with Paranormal, released in 2017.

 The Eyes of Alice Cooper, released in 2003, is the sixteenth solo album by Alice Cooper. With this album, Cooper returned to his earlier hard rock sound, in the vein of The Last Temptation, and left the heavy industrial metal sound found in his last two studio albums. Of note is the album cover, which was released in four different versions, featuring alternate colours in Cooper's eyes and the crescent around the 'A' in the title. It was available in blue, green, purple and red. In the 2010 Behind the Music Remastered on Alice Cooper, "Between High School & Old School" was described as "a modern Alice Cooper classic" for its return to the topic of school (a reference to "School's Out").

 Neal Smith (born September 23, 1947) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock group Alice Cooper from 1967 to 1974. He performed on the group's early albums Pretties for You and Easy Action, their breakout album Love It to Death and the subsequent successful albums Killer, School's Out, and Billion Dollar Babies. The last new studio album with the five original Alice Cooper group members participating in new music was Muscle of Love in 1973. The original group's Greatest Hits studio album was released in 1974. In 2018 (fifty years after the original group debuted its new 

 name Alice Cooper in 1968), a live performance album Live From The Astroturf, Alice Cooper recorded in 2015 was released, featuring four of the original group members performing eight of their hit songs, with long-time Alice Cooper solo band guitarist and friend Ryan Roxie interplaying lead guitar parts with original group rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, on behalf of original group lead guitarist Glen Buxton, who died in 1997 of pneumonia three weeks before his 50th birthday. In 2011, Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in the "Performer" category, as a member of the original Alice Cooper group.

 Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, February 4, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over 50 years. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers to be "The Godfather of Shock Rock". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, "Alice Cooper" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called The

A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an 

The main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). When we exercise, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients to support their increased activity. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. 

One of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. This increase in heart rate leads to an increase in the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction, which ultimately results in an increase in cardiac output.

By increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise. This mechanism allows the body to maintain an optimal level of performance and support the increased physical activity.

It's important to note that while increased heart rate is the main reason for the rise in cardiac output during exercise, other factors such as stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) can also contribute to the overall increase in cardiac output. The intricacies of these factors work together to meet the enhanced demand of the body during physical exertion.

The ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. These parameters include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.

Heart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles. Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tend to have lower resting heart rates and can achieve higher exercise intensities before reaching their maximum heart rate.

Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles.

Cardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate. As both stroke volume and heart rate increase with cardiovascular fitness, cardiac output also increases. This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.

Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is a measure of an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles.

Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. Increased general metabolism leads to enhanced muscle metabolism and improved utilization of energy sources during exercise. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. Venous return improves due to adaptations in blood vessels, enhancing the return of blood to the heart. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.

To optimize oxygen delivery to working muscles, individuals should engage in metabolic training, which includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.

Overall, a person's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles is influenced by various physiological parameters that are closely tied to cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise and training can lead to improvements in these parameters, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery and improved performance during physical activities.

 Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.

The body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.
The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise.
Immediately during the start of exercise, the cardiac output (Q) increases because of an increase in stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped in liters per minute, and is the product of stroke volume and heart rate: [Q = SV x HR]. Obviously, the heart rate increases during exercise, but most people don't realize that it actually starts to pick up right before the start of exercise as a reflex. The sympathetic nervous system sends an anticipatory stimulation to get the heart ready for exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. Stroke volume can increase up to 50% - 60% of the resting value.
Oxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands. At rest, VO2 is 1 met = 3.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum value for VO2 can be anywhere between 25 - 80 mL/kg/min, depending on age and conditioning level.
There is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the heart's contraction, and should increase during exercise. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. However, diastolic blood pressure should never increase over 20 mmHg.
During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization.
Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. Minute ventilation increases through an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled per breath. Essentially this means that you breathe deeper and faster during exercise. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs.
After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands.
The changes to the cardiovascular system include increased maximal cardiac output (Qmax), increased stroke volume (SV), and reduced heart rate (HR) at rest and during sub maximal exercise. There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.
The maximum cardiac output increases as a result of stroke volume increasing a very significant amount. The increase in stroke volume is achieved from increases in the heart's contractility, elasticity, and chamber volume, as well as an increase in the thickness of the left ventricle, which is the space that holds blood before it's pumped out into the arteries to deliver oxygen and other nutrients. Therefore, the heart can literally fill up with more blood before each beat, at both rest and during exercise.
The increase in stroke volume allows resting heart rate to decrease. If the heart is pumping more blood per beat at rest, it doesn't have to pump as frequently to meet the same resting cardiac output demands. Highly conditioned athletes, for example, have resting heart rates ranging from 40-60 bpm, compared to the average person's resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm.
The more advanced capillary functions ultimately allow more efficiently delivered oxygen, nutrients, and hormones, as well as an increased means for the removal of heat and metabolic byproducts.
Respiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. If the training focuses on the lower extremities, such as running, its unlikely that you will see any adaptations during upper extremity exercises.
If the athlete is training at a maximal level, then there will be an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the volume of air displaced with each full respiratory cycle (inhale and exhale).
After long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms.
The build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. Because there are better mechanisms for getting rid of contractile byproducts that end up slowing down muscle contractions, the neural pathways remain un-obstructed for longer.
The muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity.
Aerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned.
The onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) occurs at a higher percentage of aerobic capacity. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction.
All of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery.
Chronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. The muscle fiber cellular changes all contribute to increased muscle efficiency: increased myoglobin levels, mitochondrial size and number, aerobic enzymes, and metabolic energy stores (ATP, PCr, glycogen, and triglycerides). Type I muscle fibers experience an increase in aerobic capacity and some might increase in size.
Type II muscle fibers will experience an increase in aerobic capacity if the intensity of exercise is sufficient. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. While Type IIx fibers produce the most force, they're very inefficient and heavily rely on ATP and quick, low oxidative metabolisms. Type IIa fibers are known as intermediate fibers because they can use all energy systems and fatigue more slowly than Type IIx.
It's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus.

With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles.

Cardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate. As both stroke volume and heart rate increase with cardiovascular fitness, cardiac output also increases. This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.

Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is a measure of an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles.

Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. Increased general metabolism leads to enhanced muscle metabolism and improved utilization of energy sources during exercise. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. Venous return improves due to adaptations in blood vessels, enhancing the return of blood to the heart. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.

To optimize oxygen delivery to working muscles, individuals should engage in metabolic training, which includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.

Overall, a person's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles is influenced by various physiological parameters that are closely tied to cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise and training can lead to improvements in these parameters, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery and improved performance during physical activities.

 Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.

The body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.
The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise.
Immediately during the start of exercise, the cardiac output (Q) increases because of an increase in stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped in liters per minute, and is the product of stroke volume and heart rate: [Q = SV x HR]. Obviously, the heart rate increases during exercise, but most people don't realize that it actually starts to pick up right before the start of exercise as a reflex. The sympathetic nervous system sends an anticipatory stimulation to get the heart ready for exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. Stroke volume can increase up to 50% - 60% of the resting value.
Oxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands. At rest, VO2 is 1 met = 3.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum value for VO2 can be anywhere between 25 - 80 mL/kg/min, depending on age and conditioning level.
There is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the heart's contraction, and should increase during exercise. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. However, diastolic blood pressure should never increase over 20 mmHg.
During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization.
Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. Minute ventilation increases through an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled per breath. Essentially this means that you breathe deeper and faster during exercise. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs.
After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands.
The changes to the cardiovascular system include increased maximal cardiac output (Qmax), increased stroke volume (SV), and reduced heart rate (HR) at rest and during sub maximal exercise. There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.
The maximum cardiac output increases as a result of stroke volume increasing a very significant amount. The increase in stroke volume is achieved from increases in the heart's contractility, elasticity, and chamber volume, as well as an increase in the thickness of the left ventricle, which is the space that holds blood before it's pumped out into the arteries to deliver oxygen and other nutrients. Therefore, the heart can literally fill up with more blood before each beat, at both rest and during exercise.
The increase in stroke volume allows resting heart rate to decrease. If the heart is pumping more blood per beat at rest, it doesn't have to pump as frequently to meet the same resting cardiac output demands. Highly conditioned athletes, for example, have resting heart rates ranging from 40-60 bpm, compared to the average person's resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm.
The more advanced capillary functions ultimately allow more efficiently delivered oxygen, nutrients, and hormones, as well as an increased means for the removal of heat and metabolic byproducts.
Respiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. If the training focuses on the lower extremities, such as running, its unlikely that you will see any adaptations during upper extremity exercises.
If the athlete is training at a maximal level, then there will be an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the volume of air displaced with each full respiratory cycle (inhale and exhale).
After long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms.
The build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. Because there are better mechanisms for getting rid of contractile byproducts that end up slowing down muscle contractions, the neural pathways remain un-obstructed for longer.
The muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity.
Aerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned.
The onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) occurs at a higher percentage of aerobic capacity. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction.
All of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery.
Chronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. The muscle fiber cellular changes all contribute to increased muscle efficiency: increased myoglobin levels, mitochondrial size and number, aerobic enzymes, and metabolic energy stores (ATP, PCr, glycogen, and triglycerides). Type I muscle fibers experience an increase in aerobic capacity and some might increase in size.
Type II muscle fibers will experience an increase in aerobic capacity if the intensity of exercise is sufficient. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. While Type IIx fibers produce the most force, they're very inefficient and heavily rely on ATP and quick, low oxidative metabolisms. Type IIa fibers are known as intermediate fibers because they can use all energy systems and fatigue more slowly than Type IIx.
It's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus.

In conventional medicine treatment is designed to decrease the inflammation and avoid re-injures.
The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines.
Over-the-counter or prescription of anti-inflammatory medications can help temporarily, but can cause side effects also. Prolonged use of the medicines causes significant gastrointestinal upset, ulceration and bleeding. The side effects of steroids injected in the affected area can be serious and can actually worsen symptoms. Complications can include fat necrosis (death of fatty tissue) of the heel and rupture of the plantar fascia.
Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. This surgery is about 80 percent effective in the small group of individuals who do not have relief with conservative treatment, but symptoms may return if preventative measures (wearing proper footwear, shoe inserts, stretching, etc) are not maintained.
In contrast, homeopathy is a natural form of medicine. In a typical case of healing, a person's complete symptoms will be treated all together.
While prescribing a drug a complete history of the patient is taken which includes the medical history of the patient, physical and mental constitution and genetic predisposition to the disease. A properly prescribed homeopathic remedy can lower the progression of disease and in highly susceptible people can prevent the occurrence or prolong the onset of disease.
Homeopathy offers a treatment which is safe, gentle and will not end up with side effects. The allopathic medicines might provide immediate relief from the symptoms but the root cause of the problem is not touched upon and the dangerous side effects can be worse than the original symptoms. The treatment works at the deeper level of immunity and enhances the healing capacity of the body. Homeopathy medicines improve the resistance of the body.
It helps to reduce the inflammation of the affected area.
The remedies helps to reduce the pain in the affected area. Thus reducing the need for strong painkillers.
It can save you from a surgeon’s knife.
The treatment helps to strengthen your calf muscles so that calf muscles bear the maximum weight of your body.
It offers you a promising treatment and you do not have to continue medicines for your whole life. With certain life style changes and homeopathic medications heel pain or heel spur can be treated effectively.
There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. However, the correct choice and the resulting relief is a matter of experience and right judgment on the part of the doctor. The treatment is decided after thorough case taking of the patient. Thus remedies are tailor made unlike allopathy in which all patients receive the same surgery or drugs although trade name may be different.
A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. It is caused by putting too much pressure on the sinew on the soles of the feet, usually over a long period of time. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot.
Spurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the "bowstring-like" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel.
Not all heel spurs cause symptoms. Some are discovered on xrays taken for other purposes. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Heel spurs are most often seen in middle aged men and women, but can be found in all age groups.
Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot.
Plantar fasciitis - "itis" indicates the inflammation of the tissue (plantar fascia) at the arch of the foot.
The causes can range from excessive walking (especially if unaccustomed to walking), running or jumping to improperly fitted or wornout shoes. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily.
Every time you take a step, one of your heels has to support the whole weight of your body. As you move, the load is equal to 20 times your own body weight. The load is softened by a pillow of fat under the heel and a large sinew under the sole of the foot.
If an athlete does not warm up properly or a person with a sedentary job exercises heavily during the weekends, they might overload the muscles of the calf or the Achilles tendon. These are also fixed on the heel bone. When the muscles of the calf or Achilles tendon are overloaded there will be extra strain on the sinew and muscles in the soles of the foot. The overload can cause inflammation and even small cracks in the sinew.
Every time you sit down, sleep or otherwise rest your legs, the muscles of the sole of the foot will contract in an attempt to protect the damaged sinew. The pain in the heel will then no longer be felt. But when you get up again the pain will return and when you move again, the sinew will crack even more. To compensate for the repeated damage to the sinew, the body will try and repair it in the same way that it would attempt to repair a broken bone, namely, by wrapping it up in bone. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. But it is not the spur itself that causes the pain. The spur is the result of a prolonged overload of the sinew at the sole of the foot.
Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The pain is more in the morning and decreases with activity. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. The heel pain arises due to the spur pricking the surrounding tissue. The heel pain has been depicted as toothache in the foot.
A sharp, stabbing pain under or on the inside of the heel.
Most sufferers are people who are overweight and middle aged. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective.
People who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Pronated means that the foot tends to roll inwards when a person walks or runs.
Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on.
Once a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months.
Prevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis.
Shoes are a must to support the arch of the foot even when at home. Arch supports and heel cups cushion the heel and reduce the weight bearing on the foot during activities.
The intensity and duration of activity and weight bearing should be reduced. Staying off the feet can help a lot.
The workout regimen should consist of mild stretches for strengthening of foot and calf muscles so as to reduce the tension on the heel mechanically.
Rolling an ice bottle under the foot can reduce acute pain. In chronic cases heat application also helps reduce the symptoms.
Losing weight can reduce the extra pressure that plantar fascia bears with every step.
It must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs.

 Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. The considerations that affect plantar heel pain are the alignment of the foot with lower leg, foot and ankle mobility, strength and endurance of muscle. External influences on plantar heel pain are the amount of time spent on feet while exercising or standing, type of footwear used and type of floor surfaces. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Flat feet can potentially be attributed to the minimal amount of ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of the gait cycle causing more tension on the plantar fascia.

 Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray.

Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. Initially, these deposits may not have any impact on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity.

There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts.

While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. This can lead to persistent pain and difficulty walking or standing for long periods.

In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. This can cause discomfort or pain when wearing shoes or participating in activities that involve ankle movement. In such cases, surgical removal of the spur may be considered as part of treatment for insertional Achilles tendonitis.

It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.

 A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

Lemmy admits that the album was a mistake and failed sales-wise, but considers it to be "all right" and believes it was the mix that let them down, explaining: ""..We had Guy Bidmead mix it because we wanted to give him another try, mainly because he had been Vic Maile's boy and Vic was a great live mixer.

 Micael Kiriakos Delaoglou (born 31 October 1963), known professionally as Mikkey Dee, is a Swedish rock musician and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as the last drummer for British rock band Motörhead from 1991 until its dissolution following the death of Lemmy in December 2015. Dee also played temporarily in the German metal band Helloween in 2003 and is currently the drummer for the German rock band Scorpions, becoming a permanent member in September 2016. Dee is famous for lengthy drum solos, often lasting between five and fifteen minutes. Some notable examples include those that appear in Sacrifice, In the Name of Tragedy, and The One to Sing the Blues.

 "Motorhead" is a song written by Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister while he was a member of the English space rock band Hawkwind. It was later recorded by (and was the eponym for) Motörhead, as he called it this instead of Bastard on his then manager's advice.

 While King Diamond was touring with Motörhead, frontman Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992, Dee accepted, replacing Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor. On his replacement of a longstanding member, Dee said in 2006: "'Phil Taylor was great when he was good... so I could never have filled that space. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my father's place… I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.'" Dee's first gig with the band was on 30 August 1992 at Saratoga Performing Arts Center in New York. He did not have much input on that year's March ör Die album which had been recorded with Tommy

DreamWorks Animation optioned the book to develop as an animated feature film, to be directed by Guillermo del Toro and Rodrigo Blaas. Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series. Del Toro modeled the show's sensibilities after shows he grew up with such as Jonny Quest, identifying them as "really earnest and emotionally beautiful". To this end, he sought to make the main character of Jim "in that '70s mold," and "really a very good boy" with del Toro noting that this was a constant struggle for him to express. Eventually he came across Anton Yelchin, who embodied those qualities although by del Toro's estimate it still took him a few sessions to fully understand the character.

Written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, it is based on Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book of the same name.

The film stars Max Records and features the voices of James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Lauren Ambrose, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper.

 Reaction to the documentary prompted the bands and singers Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, The Beach Boys, Trace Adkins, and Trisha Yearwood to cancel their concerts at the "Bands, Brew & BBQ" event at SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in 2014. The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, "Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now." Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.

The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, and Willem Dafoe.

Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself. Released on May 30, 2003, Finding Nemo won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the first Pixar film to do so. It was also nominated in three more categories, including

In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity & Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays. Since 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep, as well as in the Netflix horror series The Haunting of Hill House, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan's follow up to The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Flanagan's mini-series Midnight Mass. Thomas worked in Stargirl portraying Doctor Mid-Nite and voicing his A.I. counterpart "Chuck" until the latter role was recast with Alex Collins in season two.

 Philanthropist Benjamin Byrd (Wentworth Miller) collapses outside of a training center for the homeless where he's made an incognito visit. When brought into Princeton Plainsboro, he offers a large payment to the hospital so that House will be able to reassemble his diagnostics team. Wilson is also placed in an ethical bind because Byrd offers a kidney to one of Wilson's needy patients. The team tries to determine whether Byrd's generosity is a symptom of mental instability, something confirmed when he offers his other kidney to Thirteen and says he's willing to live on dialysis. Dr. Jessica Adams works with House on a volunteer basis. She and Dr. Park clash over both their diagnoses of the patient and Adams' insistence on giving the proud Park increasingly large gifts, finally paying for House's car repair under the impression that it is Park's car. House reaches out to the retired Thirteen. She aids him on the case and is nearly persuaded to return to the diagnostic team full-time. He then fires her so that she can go to Greece with her new girlfriend guilt-free.

 The Boot Street Band was a BBC children comedy television programme which aired for two six-episode seasons in 1993-4. It was set in a school which appears to be run by the students, and was created by Andrew Davies and Steve Attridge. Steve Attridge wrote the second series and a book based on the idea. Idris Elba got his TV break by appearing in the series. Roland MacLeod played Mr Lear and Richard Davies played Mr Cramp.

 After the events in "Twenty Vicodin", House is two months into the additional eight added to his sentence. However, Eric Foreman (who is now the new Dean of Medicine, because Cuddy resigned the day after the events of "Moving On") makes House an offer: he would receive the opportunity for conditional release and return to the PPTH team to treat a set of donor lungs that are failing, organs that Wilson's patient (Liza Snyder) needs.

Victoria Leigh Miller of Yahoo TV gave the episode a mixed review, criticizing the fact Shelley Long's character did not appear at all, and said that the absence of the character "left more time for silly side story lines like Phil's (Ty Burrell) faux blindness after an eye doctor appointment — seriously, who gets their eyes dilated on the morning of a major family wedding? — and Lily's impromptu merry-go-round ride on a dry-cleaning conveyor."

 The New Scooby-Doo Movies is an American animated mystery comedy television series produced by Hanna-Barbera for CBS. It is the second animated television series in the studio's Scooby-Doo franchise, and follows the first incarnation, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! It premiered on September 9, 1972, and ended on October 27, 1973, running for two seasons on CBS as the only hour-long Scooby-Doo series. Twenty-four episodes were produced, 16 for the 1972–73 season and eight more for the 1973–74 season. Aside from doubling the length of each episode, The New Scooby-Doo Movies differed from its predecessor in the addition of a rotating special guest star slot; each episode featured real world celebrities or well-known animated characters joining the Mystery, Inc. gang in solving mysteries. The New Scooby-Doo Movies was the last incarnation of Scooby-Doo airing on CBS, and also the franchise's final time to feature Nicole Jaffe as the regular voice of Velma Dinkley, due to her marriage and retirement from acting. A spin-off titled Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? was released in 2019 in which features guest stars like The New Scooby-Doo Movies including Bill Nye, Halsey, Chris Paul, Wanda Sykes, Sia, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mark Hamill.

 The New Scooby-Doo Movies is an American animated mystery comedy television series produced by Hanna-Barbera for CBS. It is the second animated television series in the studio's Scooby-Doo franchise, and follows the first incarnation, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! It premiered on September 9, 1972, and ended on October 27, 1973, running for two seasons on CBS as the only hour-long Scooby-Doo series. Twenty-four episodes were produced, 16 for the 1972–73 season and eight more for the 1973–74 season. Aside from doubling the length of each episode, The New Scooby-Doo Movies differed from its predecessor in the addition of a rotating special guest star slot; each episode featured real world celebrities or well-known animated characters joining the Mystery, Inc. gang in solving mysteries. The New Scooby-Doo Movies was the last incarnation of Scooby-Doo airing on CBS, and also the franchise's final time to feature Nicole Jaffe as the regular voice of Velma Dinkley, due to her marriage and retirement from acting. A spin-off titled Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? was released in 2019 in which features guest stars like The New Scooby-Doo Movies including Bill Nye, Halsey, Chris Paul, Wanda Sykes, Sia, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mark Hamill.

A contributor of Japanese magazine CD Journal noticed that the R&B composition was a very "common" trait in Western culture in the late 1990s. Kano, writing for Rockin'On Japan, agreed, and felt the song infused contemporary soul and club music. The writer commented that their experimentation with R&B music was signfiying to Japanese culture, as he felt the country did not emphasize the genre. Additionally, he noticed the contrast of their "painful" yet "innocent" vocal range in the number. In a similar review, Mori Tomoyuki from Amazon.com believed that the singers use of R&B "influence the country" and other growing musicians. In 2009, for the singers second English-language album This Is the One, there is a song titled "Automatic Part. 2", which samples parts of the English mentions from the Japanese release. 

 (for the single "The Love Bug"), pop singer Kumi Koda, and house DJ Mondo Grosso. She has performed with Western artists: the song "Flying Without Wings" from her album Next World was a collaboration with Irish band Westlife covering the original song; the Bratz single "Show Me What You Got" was performed with Howie D of the American band Backstreet Boys. She also worked with Akon, singing the song "Beautiful", which was featured on the Japanese release of his third album, Freedom. Other artists she has collaborated with are Soul'd Out, Dabo, Verbal (of M-Flo), Rah-D, Seamo, TVXQ, Yutaka Furakawa (of the band Doping Panda), and Crystal Kay (for her single After Love: First Boyfriend/Girlfriend). American rock band Weezer covered "Meri Kuri" on the Japanese version of their album Weezer.

 All Yours is the seventh studio album by Japanese singer Crystal Kay, released through Sony Music Entertainment Japan on June 20, 2007. First editions included a DVD section, with the three music videos from the album's singles, as well as "Konna ni Chikaku de..." performed live for a special Nodame orchestra concert at the Tokyo International Forum on February 28, 2007. All Yours was re-released as a "Winter Special Package" in November 2007 with a new cover. The album became Kay's first number-one release in her eight-year career, and has been certified gold by the RIAJ for shipments of over 100,000 copies in Japan.

 Crystal King (クリスタルキング) is a Japanese pop rock and kayōkyoku band. They won commercial success at the end of 1979 with their debut single "Daitokai", which sold 1.5 million copies, winning two popular song festivals, (18th Popcon and 10th World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo), others of their hits are "Shinkirō" in 1980 (750.000 copies sold), Shojo Kōkai (1980), Passion-Lady (1981), Ceccile (1982) and "Setouchi kōshinkyoku (IN THE MOOD)" (1984). Internationally, Crystal King is best known for their composition and performance of the first two songs of the anime Fist of the North Star, "Ai Wo Torimodose" and Yuria ... Eien ni ". the original single of 1984 sold more than 500,000 copies, and adding the new versions that were released years later, sales already exceed 1 million copies sold. Today, Monsieur Yoshizaki (leader and vocalist) has the rights of the band and he is still active under the name of "Crystal King" as a solo project.

 According to the official website, the album is the last release in the "M-Flo Loves" series, which started in 2003 with "Reeewind! / M-Flo Loves Crystal Kay". As a response to that, the album includes a new collaboration with Crystal Kay, symbolizing that the "Loves" series started and ends with her. To reflect the fact that this is the last release in the "Loves" series, every track on the album (excluding the interludes), has the word "love" in its title. It was not announced what direction the band would take after this release, though the band stated in an interview that it would not disband. The album was released in CD and CD+DVD formats, a first for an M-Flo release and has 13 tracks, excluding interludes. The DVD contains the videos for the songs "Summer Time Love", "Lotta Love", "Love Song" and "She Loves the Cream", a DVJMIX by DJ Uppercut (a music video remix) and a feature titled "History of M-Flo", which is a mix of their previous works. The limited press edition of the CD+DVD format also has two performances by M-Flo member Verbal and past member, Lisa at Rhythm Nation: "Come Again" and "Been So Long".
