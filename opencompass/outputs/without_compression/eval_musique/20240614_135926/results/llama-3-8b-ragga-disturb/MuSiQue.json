According to Yankovic's Behind the Music episode, UHF enjoyed one of the most successful test screenings in Orion's history. Orion Pictures released UHF on July 21, 1989, hoping it would be a summer blockbuster that would revive their commercial fortunes. However, critical response was negative, and it was out of the theaters by the end of the month. The film has been compared to Young Einstein, which similarly scored well with test audiences but failed to make a critical impression. Yankovic has stated that it was not a \"critic movie\". As Yankovic states in his commentary \n\n UHF (released internationally as The Vidiot from UHF) is a 1989 American comedy film starring \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, David Bowe, Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson, Kevin McCarthy, Michael Richards, Stanley Brock, Gedde Watanabe, Billy Barty, Anthony Geary, Emo Philips and Trinidad Silva; the film is dedicated to Silva, who died shortly after principal filming. The film was directed by Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager, who also co-wrote the screenplay with him. The film was originally released by Orion Pictures and is currently owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Yankovic stars as George Newman, a shiftless dreamer who stumbles into managing a low-budget television station and, surprisingly, finds success with his eclectic programming \n\n theme song, a commentary track featuring director Jay Levey and Yankovic himself (with surprise guest appearances by costar Michael Richards and Emo Philips and a phoned-in appearance by Victoria Jackson), and a deleted-scenes reel with Yankovic's commentary. Shout! Factory released a special 25th Anniversary Edition of UHF on November 11, 2014, on DVD and Blu-ray, while Fabulous Films released the movie on Blu-Ray in the United Kingdom on July 27, 2015. Though Yankovic has considered the possibility of a sequel, he has not actively pursued this. Yankovic noted that UHF is \"a product of its era, and comedy has changed so much over the decades\", but also considered that the type of comedy predated the nature of Internet phenomena and viral videos. \n\n spearheaded by the antics of a janitor-turned-children's television host, Stanley Spadowski (Richards). He provokes the ire of a major network station that dislikes the competitive upstart. The title refers to the Ultra high frequency (UHF) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations often were placed in the United States. Yankovic and Levey wrote the film after Yankovic's second studio album, looking to apply the musician's parody and comedy to film, and chose the approach of George being a straight man with a vivid imagination to support the inclusion of parodies within the film. They struggled with finding a film production company for financing the \n\n new production company, Cinecorp, who were interested in the script and had given it to producers Gene Kirkwood and John W. Hyde; Kirkwood stated he had previously seen Yankovic's videos and wanted to make a movie with him. Kirkwood and Hyde had connections with Orion Pictures, who offered to fund the production as long as they could keep it under $5 million. The title of the film was selected to refer to, at the time of the film's writing, the predominance of local television stations operating on ultra-high-frequency broadcasts in the United States, which were typically known for quirky, low-cost production shows, which the film spoofed. Yankovic suggested the title The Vidiot for the film's international release, but the studio eventually went with The Vidiot from UHF in an effort to connect the international and American versions, with which Yankovic has expressed dissatisfaction.\n\nQuestion: Who founded the company that distributed the film UHF?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The program was launched on October 30, 2007 and a mockup of the aircraft was unveiled in October 2008 at the NBAA show in Orlando. The Learjet 85 was to fit between the midsize and the super midsize segments of the market. Designed for type certification under FAR-25, it was the first Bombardier Aerospace business jet to feature a composite structure. The plane was intended to have a high-speed cruise of Mach 0.82 and a transcontinental range of up to 3,000 nmi. On January 15, 2015, Bombardier announced their decision to suspend the Learjet 85 program and cut 1000 associated jobs.

London would, in 1949, be the location for the signing of the Treaty of London, establishing the Council of Europe. In 1948, the Congress of Europe was convened in the Hague, under Winston Churchill's chairmanship. It was the first time all the European unification movements had come together under one roof and attracted a myriad of statesmen including many who would later become known as founding fathers of the European Union.

Among those who were early advocates of a union of European nations was Hungarian Prime Minister Pál Teleki.

Smith graduated from law school at the top of his class in 1876. Following his graduation, Smith worked for the Lexington legal firm of Houston & Mulligan. In 1877 he was admitted to the Kentucky bar. The same year saw him elected to a two-year term as prosecuting attorney for Lexington. After completing his term of office, Smith moved to San Francisco, California where with the assistance of his cousin, newspaperman William T. Coleman, he established a legal practice. While in California he met and married Elizabeth Rathbone. The marriage produced no children.\n\nNathan Smith (September 30, 1762 – January 26, 1829) was a well known physician and professor in colonial and post-Revolutionary New England.

Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her work is of interest to social historians as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Brontë, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Brontë. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë's life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are Cranford (1851–53), North and South (1854–55), and Wives and Daughters (1865), each having been adapted for television by the BBC.\n\n first adult fiction. She then began writing her first books for children which became known as the \"Tiny series\". She followed these with the four-volume Gypsy Breynton series, which was later recognized as her best-known juvenile writing. She also published two books that depicted the realistic adventures of a four-year-old boy named Trotty, The Trotty Book (1870) and Trotty's Wedding Tour, and Story-book (1873).

Freeman is also remembered for her novel Pembroke (1894), and she contributed a notable chapter to the collaborative novel entitled The Whole Family (1908). Through her different genres of work including children's stories, poems, and short stories, Mary Wilkins Freeman sought to demonstrate her values as a feminist. During the time which she was writing, she did this in nonconventional ways; for example, she diverged from making her female characters weak and in need of help which was a common trope in literature. Through characters such as Louisa in her short story: “A New England Nun,” Freeman challenges contemporary ideas concerning female roles, values, and relationships in society. Also, Freeman's short story “The Revolt of 'Mother'\" illustrated the struggles of rural women \n\n Sarah Crompton was born in Mount Street, Birmingham, 1802. She was the eldest daughter of J. W.

Historically Little Langdale was at the intersection of packhorse routes leading to Ravenglass, Whitehaven, Keswick, Penrith & Carlisle, Ambleside, Hawkshead, and Coniston, Ulverston, Broughton-in-Furness and Barrow in Furness. Slater's Bridge which crosses the River Brathay in 3 spans supported by a large mid-stream boulder and stone causeways is a 16th-century, slate-built, former packhorse bridge on one of these routes. Today metalled roads from Little Langdale lead west over Wrynose Pass and Hardknott towards Eskdale, northwest by Blea Tarn to Great Langdale, northeast to Elterwater and east to the Skelwith Bridge - Coniston road. National Cycle Network's Regional Route 37 between Ambleside and Ulverston runs through the valley. The National Trust owns many farms and areas of land in the valley, many \n\n Way) (the longest), and the Thames Path, and many more. Together these are over 4000 km long. In Scotland, the equivalent trails are called Scotland's Great Trails and are administered by NatureScot. The first, and probably the most popular, is the West Highland Way, which is 152 km long and was opened in 1980.

Sustrans' flagship project is the National Cycle Network, which has created over 14,000 mi of signed cycle routes throughout the UK.\n\n East Anglia is well suited to cycling with a generally flat landscape. A number of National Cycle Network routes run through the region, including National Cycle Route 1. Provision for cyclists is good in some of the major towns within the region with Cambridge having the highest level of cycle use in the UK with between 18% and 25% of residents travelling to work by bicycle and nearly 50% of residents cycling at least once a week - the highest figure of any town or city in the UK - in a Sport England survey published in 2012.\n\nNational Cycle Route 14 in Darlington, Durham and Gateshead. ; National Cycle Route 7 in Birtley ; National Cycle Route 72 on Newcastle Quayside ; National Cycle Route 10 in Hazlerigg ; National Cycle Route 1 in Blyth The proposed route crosses or meets the existing National Cycle Network several times along its length:\n\n The National Cycle Route 725, also known as the Great North Cycleway is a partially-complete regional cycling route that forms part of the National Cycle Network (NCN) in the United Kingdom. The route is proposed to run around 70 km from Darlington to Blyth, in North East England. Although some parts of the route are shown on official NCN cycle maps by the network managers Sustrans, and some parts of the route have been created and signposted by the local authorities that it passes through, large sections of the route are missing or incomplete.\n\nQuestion: What is the network which National Cycle Route 57 is part of an example of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Yale University in 1985, graduating magna cum laude, and later earned a master's degree in English at Jesus College, Cambridge.

The book details relations between the younger Packer and his father Kerry, citing anonymous sources as stating the pair had a difficult relationship, and that James was \"relieved\" by his father's death. Business leaders and friends of the Packers including former Nine Network CEO Eddie McGuire and mining tycoon Andrew Forrest defended James Packer. Upon launching the book, Barry dismissed the criticism, calling the book \"fair\" and \"considered\". Barry has been a contributor to Crikey, an online magazine published by Private Media (in which he has a minority share). He joined Crikey in December 2010, and was given around A$152,000 2012 worth of new shares of Private Media in June 2012. In August 2011 Barry was appointed as a senior writer at Private Media's The Power Index, \"a free website [which] offers daily news, views and features about power and influence in Australia.\"\n\n during the Watergate hearings, Meier wanted to tell the nation secrets about the Nixon White House, the CIA, and Howard Hughes, but to keep him from telling his secrets, he was persecuted, jailed and forced into exile in Canada.

Along with Karl Vollers and Régis Blachère, Fück was an important early researcher into the language of the Quran.\n\n In 1519, the teachings of Martin Luther sweep through the German principalities. They are welcomed by the peasants, who hope that the new doctrines will help to liberate them from the oppressive yoke of the nobility and the magistrates. The young pastor Thomas Muentzer embraces Lutheranism, but he is more radical in his support for the peasants. In 1523, Muentzer arrives in Allstedt to assume the office of the local pastor. When a local villager is arrested after assaulting an overseer who tried to rape his sister, the priest helps him escape. He also carries a first Mass in German rather than Latin, and preaches his flock to destroy \n\n Martin Luther D'Ooge came from a Huguenot family, who emigrated from the Netherlands to the United States of America around 1851 and settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His father Leonard was a teacher; his mother was born Johanna Quintus. His younger brother was the philologist (1860–1940). D'Ooge studied Classical Philology at the University of Michigan, to which he remained connected all his life. After being awarded his bachelor's degree in 1862, he became headmaster of the Ann Arbor High School in 1863, a position he held until 1865. From 1864 to 1867 he studied theology at the Union Theological Seminary, by which he was awarded a master's degree in 1865. In 1867 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Ancient Languages at Michigan State Normal School (later Eastern Michigan University). However, he left after only one year, returning to the University of Michigan as Acting Professor \n\n Martin Luther, an ecclesiastical reformer whose teachings inspired the Reformation, wrote antagonistically about Jews in his pamphlet On the Jews and their Lies, written in 1543. He portrays the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them and provides detailed recommendations for a pogrom against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion. At one point he writes: \"...we are at fault in not slaying them...\", a passage that, according to historian Paul Johnson, \"may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to the Holocaust.\"\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of Young Man Luther's author?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1166 Stefan Nemanja overthrew Tihomir in a coup and had him and his brothers, Stracimir and Miroslav, expelled to Byzantium in 1167/1168. Stefan Nemanja defeated Tihomir and his Byzantine army. Tihomir drowned in a river and the other brothers were stripped of their titles, with Nemanja becoming ruler of All Serbia. He pardoned his brothers and Stracimir continued to rule his lands. When Stefan Nemanja besieged and retook control of Duklja in the 1180s, Stracimir and Miroslav attacked the forces of Doclean ruler and kinsman Mihailo. \n\n Born around 1270, Vladislav was the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Serbia, Stefan Dragutin, and Catherine of Hungary. Shortly before Vladislav's birth, Dragutin was awarded with the title of \"junior king\" in token of his right to succeed his father, Stefan Uroš I. Vladislav became the new heir to the Serbian throne after Dragutin dethroned his father with Hungarian assistance in 1276. A riding accident forced Dragutin to abdicate in favor of his younger brother, Milutin, in the spring of 1282, but he could retain the northern regions of Serbia as a separate realm. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, \n\n of Zavida: Tihomir in Raška, Stracimir in Duklja, Miroslav in Zahumlje and Travunia, and Stefan Nemanja in Toplica (in today's central Serbia). Stefan Nemanja rebelled against his eldest brother Tihomir in 1166, who fled with his brothers Stracimir and Miroslav to Byzantium to seek help. But later on, Stefan Nemanja defeated his Greek army of mercenaries in the same year near the town of Pantino on Kosovo in which poor Tihomir drowned in the River of Sitnica. Nemanja captured his other brothers and made peace with them by giving them rule in their former parts of the land to recognise him as the only ruler of Rashka or Serbia.

In the summer of 1165, Manuel I sent an army to pursuit Desa. Desa was granted a safe meeting with Manuel I and was escorted by a bodyguard. Desa gave oaths to Manuel I in a public humiliation after being examined in Constantinople on his diplomacy with Hungary. Manuel put Tihomir on the throne in 1166.

It is also spoken among communities of people from South Sudan living in towns in Sudan. The pidgin developed in the 19th century, among descendants of Sudanese soldiers, many of whom were recruited from southern Sudan. Residents of other large towns in South Sudan, notably Malakal and Wau, do not generally speak Juba Arabic, tending towards the use of Arabic closer to Sudanese Arabic, in addition to local languages. Reportedly, it is the most spoken language in South Sudan (more so than the official language English) despite government attempts to discourage its use due to its association with past Arab colonization.\n\n In August 2005, independence leader John Garang's funeral took place in Juba County. The month was also marked by ethnic violence in Juba and its environs. The villages of Katigiri and Wonduruba were inundated with refugees internally displaced by violence and looting in Juba County in February 2008. At least 750 people from Katigiri also relocated to Juba, the de facto metropolis of the county, during the looting. The United Nations, the county commissioner, and local militias responded to the situation. The county was the site of a month-and-a-half-long teachers' strike in November and December 2009 over furloughed salaries. The strike was resolved after the wages were paid. After the reorganisation of states decreed by President Salva Kiir Mayardit in 2015, Juba County became the Jubek State. In February 2016, the governor of the state decreed the creation of 7 new counties from the territory of the former county.\n\n from the Republic of the Sudan. However, influential parties including the South Sudanese government expressed dissatisfaction with the city's suitability as a national capital, and the government proposed that a new planned city be built as a replacement capital elsewhere, most likely Ramciel in Lakes. On 5 September 2011, the government announced the capital of South Sudan would move some 250 km away from Juba to Ramciel, which is located in the middle of South Sudan, about 60 km from Yirol West County, Lakes State. As of June 2020, the move has yet to occur.

He was elected to parliament at the 1970 parliamentary election, representing Kiriella for the LSSP. Nanayakkara later left the LSSP and in 1977 joined with other former members of the LSSP, including Vikramabahu Karunaratne, to form the Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP). He was the NSSP's candidate in Ehaliyagoda at 1977 parliamentary election but failed to get elected. He was the NSSP's candidate at the 1982 presidential election. He came fifth and last after receiving only 17,005 votes (0.26%). The Sri Lankan government proscribed the NSSP, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CP) after the Black July anti-Tamil riots of 1983. Nanayakkara, Karunaratne, Rohana Wijeweera and other left-wing politicians went \n\n party and it had lost most of its political support. Sangaree had been a vocal critic of the government sponsored paramilitary groups. Following the dismal showing of the rump TULF in elections, Sangaree abandoned his beliefs and joined forces with two paramilitary groups (People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam and Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (Padmanaba wing)) to form the Democratic Tamil National Alliance. This new alliance contested provincial and local elections but with little success though Sangaree was elected to Jaffna Municipal Council at the 2009 local elections. Sangaree did another volte-face in 2011, joining force with the TNA to contest the 2011 local elections.\n\n The party was established in 1986, aiming to be a multi-racial party. It was formed by former People's National Movement members and opposition parties, including the Organisation for National Reconstruction (a party established in by PNM dissident Karl Hudson-Phillips in 1980), the United Labour Front, the Democratic Action Congress and the Tapia House Movement – the latter three having previously been part of an electoral pact known as the National Alliance. The new party won the 1986 elections, taking around 66% of the national vote (the first time the PNM had failed to win over 50% since 1956) and winning 33 of the 36 \n\n National Team Unity (NTU) was a political party in Trinidad and Tobago led by Human Rights lawyer and former Attorney General Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj. Founded as Team Unity, to contest party elections in the United National Congress in 2001, the slate of candidates was led by Maharaj. Team Unity won 21 of 24 contested executive posts including the Deputy Leadership (won by Maharaj). Later that year a rift with UNC leader Basdeo Panday led Maharaj, together with Oropouche Member of Parliament Trevor Sudama and Naparima MP Ralph Maraj, to leave the party. This caused the UNC to lose its parliamentary majority, forcing national elections. Renaming itself National Team Unity, the party contested the 2001 general elections, winning 2.5% of the vote but no seats. It did not contest the 2002 general elections, and remains more of a pressure group than a true national political party. In 2004 Ralph Maraj returned to the PNM (which he had left in 1995) as a speechwriter for Prime Minister Patrick Manning. As of 2006 the NTU appears to be a moribund organization. Its leader Maharaj has rejoined the United National Congress.\n\n Nanayakkara then formed a new party called the Left & Democratic Alliance and stood as its candidate, against President Kumaratunga, at the 1999 presidential election. He came seventh after receiving 23,668 votes (0.28%). The Left & Democratic Alliance was later renamed the Democratic Left Front (DLF). It joined the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the successor to the PA. Nanayakkara was chosen as the UPFA's mayoral candidate for Colombo at the 2006 local government elections. He was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council but the UPFA failed to gain control of the council. Nanayakkara became the leader of the opposition on the council. Nanayakkara was chosen as one of the UPFA's parliamentary candidates for Ratnapura District at the 2010 parliamentary election.

In this short-lived band on drums was Caryl's friend Phil Collins, for whom Caryl was best man at his first wedding. In 1970, they both auditioned for Genesis and whilst Collins obtained the job as drummer, Caryl was unsuccessful and after a brief stint with Mick Barnard on guitar, Steve Hackett was recruited as a permanent replacement lead guitarist for Anthony Phillips. Caryl went on to play in some other bands, including Sanctuary in 1972, with whom he recorded an unreleased album.

The fleshed out Amasic included Thibault as singer and rhythm guitarist, Matt McCormack as bassist and co-vocalist, Jessy Bergy as lead guitarist, and Mehdi Zidani as drummer. The group was initially promoted as a full band through their music videos posted on the BryanStars YouTube channel.

In the 12th century, the Bintan island in the Strait of Malacca was known as the \"Pirate Island\" since the Malay pirates used to loot trading ships sailing in these waters. Singapore, the closest major city, is a 45-50 minute trip by motorised catamaran across the Singapore Strait from Bintan Resort area in the northwest of the island. The island has beaches with beach-front hotels and resorts; the most prominent of these beaches is the Bintan Resorts set over an area of 300 ha of tropical environment. The archipelago of the Riau islands is right opposite to this resort across the South China Sea. Indonesia is promoting Bintan as the next best tourist destination after Bali.\n\n Balayan Bay is a large bay of Luzon Island in the Philippines. It is part of the Verde Island Passage and its entire shore is in the province of Batangas. The bay is between 23 to 28 km wide. It is separated from the South China Sea to the west by the Calatagan Peninsula, which has Cape Santiago as its southern point. The Calumpan Peninsula forms the bay's eastern side, that separates it from Batangas Bay. The following municipalities line the bay from west to east: Calatagan, Balayan, Calaca, Lemery, Taal, San Luis, Bauan, and Mabini.\n\n The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometers to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the \"Kalayaan Group of Islands\". Palawan's almost 2000 km of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3500 ft in altitude, with the highest peak \n\n Basiao Island Beach, formally known as Aba-Aba Island Park, is located in Barangay Basiao, Catbalogan City, Samar, Philippines. It is composed of three islets interconnected through basal karst and coastal carbonate calcium carbonate brought about by continuous diastrophism. It faces Majaba Island on the northwest direction of the islet while the opposite headland side faces the southern part of Catbalogan City, approximately three nautical miles. Basiao is one of 57 barangays of Catbalogan City, the capital of Samar Province. Basiao Island has the potential as a coral garden, marina or marine resort with activities ideal for diving, snorkeling, sailing, sport fishing, kayaking and other water sports. Aside from its strategic location, the island is endowed with rich resources such as wide diversity of molluscs, reptiles, fish, crustaceans and other marine invertebrates such as exotic seahorse, crabs, grouper and many more species. Unique to the island is the Aba-Aba, a shellfish found only in the cluster islands of Basiao and Buad, thus the former name Aba-Aba Island Park.\n\n Bintan Island or Negeri Segantang Lada is an island in the Riau archipelago of Indonesia. It is part of the Riau Islands province, the capital of which, Tanjung Pinang, lies in the island's south and is the island's main community. Bintan's land area is 1173 km2 (total area is 60057 km2 including 96% sea area). Its administrative region is designated the Bintan Regency, one of the six administrative regencies of the Riau Islands province. The city of Tanjung Pinang is an autonomous area geographically within Bintan Island but not included in the Regency. Bintan's history is traced to the early 3rd century.

The \"Canadian pizza\" toppings typically include tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, pepperoni, and mushrooms; although variations exist, this recipe is also known internationally by that name. The typical preparation of the same recipe is often referred to in Québécois as pizza québécoise. Poutine pizza is one variety that can be found sporadically across the country, and adaptations of this item have even been featured in upscale restaurants. Atlantic Canada has several unique varieties, which have spread to other parts of \n\n The usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the Aussie, Australian or Australiana, which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as prawns are also popular. In the 1980s some Australian pizza shops and restaurants began selling \"gourmet pizzas\", that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as mangoes, salmon, dill, bocconcini, tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as kangaroo meat, emu and crocodile. \"Wood-fired pizzas\", that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by wood fuel, are well-regarded. Franchised pizza chains coexist with independent pizzerias. Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops often sell pizza, which is often done in a Lebanese or Turkish style. In Australia, barbecue sauce and traditional tomato sauce are both common and popular sauces for pizza bases. White pizza (i.e.: without sauce) is not common.\n\n The Fair Food Program has completed four year of implementation across the Florida tomato industry as well as its first year of expansion to Florida-based tomato growers’ operations in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The program is currently expanding to strawberries and green bell peppers in Florida.

He went on to become Australia's longest serving Labor prime minister and remains the third longest serving Australian prime minister after Robert Menzies and John Howard. Hawke again led the party to the 1984 Election and was returned with a reduced majority, in an expanded House of Representatives: with Labor taking 82 seats to the Coalition's 66. Labor went on to a third straight victory at the 1987 Election and increased its majority from 16 to 24 seats. Hawke fought his final election in 1990, with Labor winning a nine-seat majority.

These divisions were reflected federally in the forced resignation of Robert Menzies as the Prime Minister in August 1941, and the UAP disintegrated at a state level in 1943. The remnants of the UAP combined with the newly formed Commonwealth Party to form the Democratic Party in that year.

Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle.

The Party had been banned before: following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Party had opposed Australian involvement in the Second World War in 1939, which gave Menzies' United Australia Party-Country Party government the opportunity to dissolve it on 15 June 1940 under the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations 1940, (Cth) relying on the defence power of the Constitution of Australia.

He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, after finishing his secondary education at Geelong Grammar School, and then returned to Australia to take over his father's property in northern Victoria.

There are currently six living former prime ministers. The most recent former prime minister to die was Bob Hawke, on 16 May 2019. The prime ministership of Frank Forde, who was replaced 7 days after taking office in 1945, was the shortest in Australian history. Robert Menzies served the longest, over eighteen years. Of those who have served as the nation's prime minister, two died in office (Joseph Lyons and John Curtin), one was dismissed (Gough Whitlam), one disappeared (Harold Holt), and six resigned following leadership spills (John Gorton, Bob Hawke, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull).\n\n Governor-General John Kerr after the Coalition blocked supply in the Senate after a series of political scandals, and was defeated at the 1975 federal election in the largest landslide of Australian federal history.

Firstly, there has been an unjustified growth in the number of students without a corresponding increase in the resources and teaching capacity to effectively educate them. This has led to overcrowded classrooms and limited access to practical training, ultimately affecting the quality of education.\n\nSecondly, there has been a loss of motivation to study among students. This can be attributed to the lack of proper career guidance and limited prospects for specialization or career advancement within the medical field. This has resulted in a decline in the overall quality of education and the competence of graduates.\n\nThe Bologna system aims to address these issues by introducing certain reforms in higher education. One of the key aspects of the Bologna system is the implementation of two-level training systems. This allows students who have completed the first-level course to transition to another specialty, thereby providing more flexibility and opportunities for specialization. Additionally, this system helps to shorten the total length of training, enabling students to enter the workforce sooner.\n\nFurthermore, the Bologna system emphasizes competency-based education. This approach focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge that are relevant to the medical field, ensuring that graduates are competent and prepared for their professional roles. It is important to note that the competency-based model, which is considered an exclusively European innovation, has actually been borrowed from the Soviet higher education system.\n\nWhile the Bologna system provides potential solutions to the issues faced in higher medical education, it is crucial to acknowledge that its widespread implementation has not been without challenges. In some cases, the principles of the Bologna Declaration have given rise to contradictory and conflicting attitudes, even within the western educational model.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bologna system offers possibilities for improving the quality of higher medical education in post-Soviet territories by introducing two-level training systems and competency-based education. However, careful consideration and adaptation of these principles are necessary to effectively address the specific challenges faced in each country or region.\n\n in Burma, affirmative action of sorts was introduced by the government of U Nu in the 1950s, primarily due to the disproportionate control the Anglo-Burmans had in government departments and the running of the country. Many Anglo-Burmese began to lose their jobs, to be replaced with pure Burmans as the bureaucracy of the country became increasingly Burmanized. Additional measures relating to the Burmese language were introduced so that to take the matriculation exam to enter Rangoon University, prospective students were required to be fluent in written Burmese (which many Anglo-Burmans had not been taught), even though all books and most teaching were still carried out in English.\n\nThere is increased interest in strengthening health systems for developing countries. However, at present, there is common uncertainty about how to accomplish this task. Specifically, several nations are faced with an immense challenge of revamping an entire system. To accomplish this, it is essential to first identify the components of the system that require modification. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed health system building blocks, which are now widely recognized as essential components of health systems strengthening.\nWith increased travel and urbanization, the threat of emerging diseases of pandemic potential is increasing alongside endemic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis virus infections. At the same time, the epidemiologic patterns are shifting, giving rise to a concurrent increase in disease burden due to non-communicable diseases. These diseases can be addressed by public health surveillance and response systems that are operated by competent public health workers in core public health positions at national and sub-national levels with a focus on disease prevention.\nWe describe two ways that health ministries in developing countries could leverage President Obama’s Global Health Initiative (GHI) to build public health surveillance and response systems using proven models for public health systems strengthening and to create the public health workforce to operate those systems. We also offer suggestions for how health ministries could strengthen public health systems within the broad health systems strengthening agenda. Existing programs (e.g., the Global Vaccine Alliance [GAVI] and the Global Fund Against Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria [GFTAM]) can also adapt their current health systems strengthening programs to build sustainable public health systems.\nDespite increased interest in strengthening health systems for developing countries, the current reality is that the health systems in most developing countries fall short of the requirements to implement the goals suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR). One of the greatest obstacles that countries face is a clear understanding of the steps that are needed to strengthen a health system. To address this issue, the WHO has proposed health system building blocks which are now widely recognized as essential components of health systems strengthening . These building blocks include service delivery, financing, governance, the health workforce, information systems, and supply management systems. The proposed building blocks address the full range of services required for an effective public health system and include both treatment-based and preventive strategies. The WHO has also recently launched an intervention to address the alarming shortage of health workers in developing countries, which includes curative and preventive public health staff .\nThe threats posed by emerging pandemic threats intensify the need to develop worldwide capacity for public health surveillance and response. With increased travel and urbanization, the threat of emerging diseases of pandemic potential is increasing. Against a backdrop of endemic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis virus infections, epidemiologic patterns are shifting, giving rise to significant increases in disease burden due to of non-communicable diseases. Good international public health surveillance and response, which is the basis of the revised IHR, cannot exist sustainably without good domestic surveillance and response. Both IHR(2005) and domestic public health surveillance and response require public health systems that are operated by competent public health workers in core public health positions at national and sub-national levels with a focus on disease prevention. However, when officials seek to address these public health issues, they are faced with several interrelated problems including human resource capacity, disease surveillance and reporting capacity, and response capacity. Clearly, an integrated and sustainable approach that enables the development of public health worker capacity will be critical to achieving public health surveillance and response systems that have a sustainable and adaptable capacity to address evolving public health needs.\nAn example of the urgent need to develop public health surveillance and response systems in developing countries is the 2009 influenza A H1N1, the first pandemic of the 21st century, which had a significantly greater impact among individuals with underlying diseases in the northern hemisphere , and had more severe effects in populations with large HIV and TB burdens in the southern hemisphere . In what appears to be a reversal of the usual picture that is observed with emerging infectious diseases, influenza A H1N1 was exported from developed nations with adequate public health surveillance and response systems to developing nations with inadequate public health surveillance and response systems , and could have had devastating effects.\nWe describe two ways that health ministries in developing countries could leverage U.S. President Obama’s Global Health Initiative (GHI), to build public health systems using proven models for public health systems strengthening and create the public health workforce to operate those systems. Specifically, we discuss the successful Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) and the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), and efforts to establish integrated disease surveillance and response within developing countries. We also offer suggestions for how health ministries could strengthen public health systems within the broad health systems strengthening agenda. Existing programs (e.g., the Global Vaccine Alliance [GAVI] and the Global Fund Against Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria [GFTAM]) can also adapt their current health systems strengthening programs to build sustainable public health systems.\nGHI will provide an opportunity for major investments in sustainable health systems strengthening and public health systems strengthening in developing countries. With an estimated USD 63 billion investment in global health, GHI will be the principal engine for global health development for the foreseeable future. The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) reauthorization, which is part of GHI, includes the goal of pre-service training for 140,000 new health care workers within five years in the recipient countries . We believe that these new health workers will need to respond by providing both treatment and preventive service, and that the number of public health workers needed to make a significant change in the operation of public health systems is substantially less than number of health care workers needed for curative health care services. While the focus of public health system strengthening has previously been aimed at treatment of disease, the advent of emerging pandemics necessitates incorporation of other specialties including epidemio-logic, laboratory and management expertise. In our experience, a successful way to strengthen public health surveillance and response systems is through Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FETPs and FELTPs) or allied programs (e.g., Public Health Schools Without Walls)  and through competency-based short courses, mainly those in basic field epidemiology for frontline surveillance and response staff .\nreduction in morbidity and mortality from priority diseases in the host country.\nAlthough no precise studies have been done to establish a target for the public health workforce, for a basic multi-disease public health surveillance and response system to be operational in a developing country, certain core public health positions and structures are critically needed at the national and sub-national level. At the sub-national level, a province, or region, comprised of several districts is commonly the point of primary public health program implementation. We believe that a province or region should have at least three FETP/FELTP graduates to operate basic multi-disease public health surveillance and response systems: one to lead communicable and non-communicable disease surveillance; one to lead communicable and non-communicable disease control; and one to lead the public health laboratory network for the province. These graduates should be working together within a provincial disease surveillance and disease control unit reporting to the provincial medical director and with a complement of district-based frontline staff that are trained in basic field epidemiology and public health laboratory practice as they jointly operate public health systems within the province. Larger provinces may need to have more graduates to address specific diseases and graduates may even be deployed at the district level in smaller countries.\nAt the national level, a team of FETP/FELTP graduates working in a national multi-disease surveillance, disease control, and public health laboratory unit or department should be linked to the provincial disease surveillance, disease control, and public health laboratory units to form a robust national multi-disease surveillance and response network. More FETP/FELTP graduates may be needed for specific programmatic needs at the national level (e.g., to operate the HIV, TB or malaria programs). Some health ministries may need to train a cadre of public health managers and logisticians for the public health systems to operate efficiently. The multi-disease surveillance, disease control, and laboratory network positions at national and sub-national level would then form the core public health positions that are necessary for essential public health actions to occur within the country. The national and provincial multi-disease surveillance and disease control departments and units would form the network through which these essential public health functions would be conducted.\nWe believe that a country would have an adequate coverage of public health workers trained in the FETP or FELTP if there are three to five graduates per million inhabitants in the country, to reach adequate coverage an FETP or FELTP would need to be operating for more than 5-10 years.\nFETPs/FELTPs have developed international and regional networks (e.g., Training in Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET, http://www.tephinet.org) , and the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET, http://www.afenet.net) ), that are playing a major role in networking trainees and graduates for effective public health surveillance and response systems. AFENET, for example, is supporting graduates to implement various public health surveillance and response activities in the health ministries of member countries, and TEPHINET and AFENET trainees and graduates have participated in international outbreak investigation and management teams under the auspices of the WHO.\nMany FETPs/FELTPs are currently operated by their host country nationals and have transitioned from direct donor funding. Examples of programs that have transitioned from donor funding in Africa include those in Zimbabwe and Uganda. Most programs have a steering committee that is led by the ministry of health and includes all important stakeholders (e.g., the host country university, donors, the WHO, etc.) The steering committee shepherds that vision of the program which includes career paths for the graduates, a plan for sustainability, and a plan for transitioning from donor funding. Many programs are led by graduates of the initial cohorts of trainees, including those in Brazil, Thailand, and Kenya.\nSeveral programs aim to improve public health surveillance and response in developing countries by addressing specific disease control needs (e.g., vaccine preventable disease surveillance and response or HIV/AIDS), often in line with donor perspectives. There are also crosscutting initiatives aiming to improve the general public health surveillance and response system in a multi-disease manner. The WHO’s Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Strategy (IDSR), which is being implemented in all 46 Member States of the WHO’s African Regional Office and in the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Project in India, are examples of general crosscutting public health and response improvement programs that have originated in developing countries. With sustained support from USAID and other donors from 1998 to date, IDSR has been successful because in addition to being a threshold-based surveillance strategy that focuses on public health response at the district or equivalent level, its implementation has gone through a process which allows all stakeholders to achieve a shared vision of what good multi-disease public health surveillance and response can look like in their country. Th]e IDSR process starts with a baseline in-depth assessment and analysis of gaps, and then development of prioritized plans of action, which are implemented by the various stakeholders in a coordinated manner and are monitored, evaluated, and improved [14, 15]. Currently, IDSR is the platform on which IHR implementation in Africa will be built and it is moving to address non-communicable diseases.\nPEPFAR has supported initiatives to strengthen public health laboratory systems to address multiple diseases in resource-constrained settings by leveraging and integrating all the support for laboratory services, after the development of national laboratory strategic plans [16, 17]. The strategic plans include consideration for policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks, the administrative and technical management structure of the laboratories, human resources and retention strategies, laboratory quality management systems, monitoring and evaluation systems, procurement and maintenance of equipment, and laboratory infrastructure enhancement. Several countries have developed or are in the process of developing their laboratory plans, and others, such as Ethiopia, have implemented and evaluated their plans .\nDevote at least as much attention to public health as is given to treatment-focused health efforts in all aspects of health systems strengthening in order to lay adequate emphasis on public health systems strengthening within broader health systems strengthening.\nLeverage GHI and other multilateral and bilateral funding to ensure that some of those resources are used to develop sustainable public health systems, with a focus on developing and retaining the public health workforce in core public health positions at national and sub-national level to operate the strengthened systems.\nAdapt existing public health system frameworks (e.g., IDSR), including the processes that lead to a shared vision, a common strategic plan, and a common set of indicators to other priority public health conditions (e.g., maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases, and environmental hazards).\nSupport the ongoing process of strengthening public health laboratory services using a multi-disease approach through one national strategic plan and coordinated and leveraged investments.\nImplement training programs for public health leaders and frontline public health workers within the country with a focus on critical outcomes that are measured and improved upon incrementally.\nLeverage existing funding mechanisms like GAVI and GFATM to develop sustainable public health systems which are operated by competently training public health workers.\nUsing approaches such as these will ensure that the current interest in health systems strengthening is translated into sustainable public health strengthening along with curative health system strengthening which is the main focus of current efforts. Preventive or public health system strengthening will be critical to address the myriad of health challenges that are faced by developing countries including IHR and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those that address public health issues.\nDeveloping countries need a public health workforce to operate public health surveillance and response systems, good domestic public health surveillance and response is necessary for implementation of IHR(2005). FETPs and FELTPs provide a proven strategy to develop a locally-trained public health workforce for public health surveillance and response, and IDSR provides a strategy that can be used to develop a basic multi-disease surveillance and response system that can be operated by FETP and FELTP graduates. We strongly suggest that development partners should support developing countries to try both these strategies as one way to ensure implementation of IHR as well as domestic surveillance and response priorities.\nAll the authors participated in conceiving the idea for the paper and helped with writing sections of the paper.

English literature was still relatively inaccessible although both English and Burmese, in a curriculum called Anglo-Vernacular, was now taught in schools. Despite the fact that Burmese literature was well entrenched in Burmese culture, the lack of patrons to support literature slowed its further development. The colonial period marked a tremendous change in Burmese literature, which had once been patronised and innovated by members of the royal \n\n  The equal right to education for men and women is guaranteed by Myanmar’s Constitution. In 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military rule. Between 2008 and 2013, because of the government's encouragement of education policies, Myanmar saw a rise in the number of girls attaining education. Currently, there are more women than men in Myanmar's education system. The literacy rate for adult women is 86% compared to just over 90% for men. Education is co-educational at all levels. Despite the progress, there are continued traditional cultural barriers that prevent women from capitalizing on their education attainment. There are extreme disparities between urban and rural educational performance. The Shan State region of Myanmar has the lowest female literacy rates at 59.4%.Additionally while a growing proportion of women are pursuing higher education this number does not match the future employment fate of women, where men make the larger proportion of those in the workforce. Moreover, women still do not occupy senior levels of economic decision making, despite their high education.\n\nQuestion: What was the average per capita GVA in 2013 of the country which created Burma's academic system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the present-day, \"English Bibles with the Apocrypha are becoming more popular again\", usually being printed as intertestamental books.

His largest written work is The Life-study of the Bible, comprising over 25,000 pages of commentary on every book of the Bible from the perspective of the believers' enjoyment and experience of God's divine life in Christ through the Holy Spirit. A radio broadcast called Life-study of the Bible with Witness Lee was later produced from these spoken messages. Following the Life-study Lee began a focused Crystallization-study to look at high points, or \"crystals,\" of each book of the Bible. However, he died before completing this work. He was also the chief editor of a new translation of the New Testament into English and Chinese called the Recovery Version. In addition, Witness Lee wrote, collected, and translated Christian hymns. In 1963 and 1964, he wrote the lyrics to approximately 200 new hymns that he compiled together with hymns from other authors. These were then categorized by topic for Hymns, with a total of 1,080 songs, published by Living Stream Ministry.\n\n the Old Testament and New Testament. Prior to 1629, all English-language Protestant Bibles included the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament; examples include the \"Matthew's Bible (1537), the Great Bible (1539), the Geneva Bible (1560), the Bishop's Bible (1568), and the King James Bible (1611)\". Fourteen out of eighty biblical books comprise the Protestant Apocrypha, first published as such in Luther's Bible (1534). Many of these texts are considered canonical Old Testament books by the Catholic Church, affirmed by the Council of Rome (AD 382) and later reaffirmed by the Council of Trent (1545–63); all of the books of the \n\n The Making of the Pentateuch (\"The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study\", JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1987) by R. N. Whybray, Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies at the University of Hull (UK), was a major contribution to the field of Old Testament studies, and specifically to theories on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch. Its originality lay in its detailed critique of the documentary hypothesis, and it remains a standard text on many reading lists.\n\n On the Reliability of the Old Testament (William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids and Cambridge, 2003: ISBN: 0-8028-4960-1) is a book by British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen (1932-). The book provides the reader with \"the most sweeping scholarly case in a generation for the traditional beliefs held by Orthodox Jews and Christian conservatives\", according to Richard Ostling. The book was intended to serve as a counterpart to F.F. Bruce's Are the New Testament Documents Reliable? (1943), and in so doing to counter the arguments of Biblical minimalism, which casts doubt upon the historical value of the Old Testament.

These ships integrate many new features and involve design changes that ensure a far more advanced weapons platforms compared to the earlier Project 15 ships. The ship's air defence capability, designed to counter the threat of enemy aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles, revolve around the vertical launch, long range surface-to-air missile system, co-developed by DRDO. Four AK-630 rapid-fire guns will provide the ship with close-in-defence capability while an MR gun will enable her to provide effective naval gunfire support. India-developed twin tube torpedo launchers and rocket launchers will add punch to the ship's anti-submarine capability. INS Chennai is designed to carry the supersonic BrahMos surface-to-surface missile system. The system enables the ship to engage shore-based and naval surface targets at long range making it a lethal platform for strike against enemy targets.\n\n This missile was developed after facing significant difficulties in compacting similarly capable Agni-III to equip INS Arihant. K-4 is an intermediate-range submarine-launched ballistic missile development by DRDO. It is a 10 m long missile weighing 20 tonnes, capable of carrying a 2 tonne payload up to a range of 3,500 km. INS Arihant, first of the Arihant Class Submarines, will be able to carry 4 K-4 missiles. The K-4 missile was successfully tested on 24 March 2014 from an underwater pontoon submerged 30 m deep. India successfully test fired the 3,500 km strike range nuclear-capable K-4 submarine-launched ballistic missile off the coast of Andhra Pradesh on 19 January 2020. On 24 January 2020, the final trials were carried out by DRDO in which missile achieved the near zero circular error probability and hit the target 3,500 km away. This was carried from INS Arihant and clears all validation test. K-4 has been completed all the trials and cleared for production by government. It will be used arm the Arihant-class submarine and future S5-class submarine. It will greatly enhance the India nuclear doctrine as K-15 has range of 750 km and it will have the range of 3,500 km.\n\n fighting vehicle licence produced as \"Sarath\" in India. The carriers are capable of carrying four ready-to-fire missiles in the observation/launch platform which can be elevated with more missiles available for reload within the carrier. For the Air Force, a nose-mounted thermal imaging system has been developed for guiding the missile's trajectory \"Helina\". The missile has a completely fiberglass structure and weighs around 42 kg. Nag was test fired for the 45th time on 19 March 2005 from the Test Range at Ahmednagar (Maharashtra), signalling the completion of the developmental phase. It will now enter production phase, subject to user trials and acceptance by the Indian Army. Further versions of the missile may make use of an all-weather Milli-metre Wave (mmW) seeker as an additional option. This seeker has reportedly been developed and efforts are on to integrate it into the missile.\n\n Nag (Sanskrit: नाग meaning cobra) is India's third generation \"Fire-and-forget\" anti-tank missile. It is an all weather, top attack missile with a range of 0.5 to 4 km. The missile uses an 8 kg high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) tandem warhead capable of defeating modern armour including Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) and composite armour. Nag uses Imaging Infra-Red (IIR) guidance with day and night capability. Mode of launch for the IIR seeker is LOBL (lock-on before launch). Nag can be mounted on an infantry vehicle; a helicopter launched version will also be available with integration work being carried out with the HAL Dhruv. Separate versions for the Army and the Air Force are being developed. For the Army, the missiles will be carried by specialist carrier vehicles (NAMICA-Nag Missile Carrier) equipped with a thermographic camera for target acquisition.

In the 1980s, she appeared in Only Fools and Horses as June Snell, a former girlfriend of Del Boy. She also appeared in The Rag Trade as Kathy Roberts, EastEnders as Cindy Beale's mother, Bev Williams, in Heartbeat as Ruby Rowan, Nick Berry's character's mother, and as a prostitute in an episode of Joking Apart. Her other notable TV appearances have included Alas Smith and Jones, Bergerac, Minder, Carry On Laughing and The Bill. She also had her own special called Let There Be Langton. She played Private Alice Easy in the 1976 film Carry On England.

Much of the characters and locations in the Constable series were directly used for creating the setting and plots in Heartbeat, under guidance from Rhea. The series was originally intended as a launch platform for actor Nick Berry, following his involvement on the BBC's soap drama EastEnders, who alongside actress Niamh Cusack, were the \n\n Lines 1992–1994 and, in 1995, a role in Kavanagh QC.

The most famous rendition of the song is a 1986 cover of the song by Don Johnson, which was released as a single and included on Johnson's album Heartbeat. Johnson's cover became an international hit, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and charting highly in many European countries.

Bradley Stern of MuuMuse raved: \"'Move Your Body', a pulsating Shakira offering, proves once again that the 'Titanium' singer is a more than welcome addition to the club scene, providing a sweaty, carnal call-to-arms filled with an instant catchy chant for the dance floor.\" Alex McCown-Levy of The A.V.

The track was the first to be released under Jefferson's own name, following several earlier house music tracks he made under aliases such as Virgo. After making several popular tracks to tape and giving them to Chicago-based DJ Ron Trent, Jefferson released his first track \"Go Wild Rhythm Tracks\" on Trax Records and later became an A&R in 1986. Despite negative reception from his co-workers and Trax owner Larry Sherman, Jefferson's track \"Move Your Body\" became popular with patrons of Chicago dance music clubs in 1985 from cassette tapes, leading to the tracks eventual release in August 1986. \"Move Your Body\" opens with a piano chord and is among the earliest house music tracks to feature piano. The music recorded for the song was originally played much slower during the recording process and sped up by Jefferson for its final release.

On September 5 The Voyager 1 space probe launched by NASA to study the Jovian system, Saturnian system and the interstellar medium.\n\n In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, rings, and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Because of the earlier discovery of a thick atmosphere on Titan, the Voyager controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory elected for Voyager 1 to make a close approach of Titan. This greatly increased knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon, but also proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths, so no surface details were seen. The flyby also changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System which prevented Voyager 1 from completing the Planetary Grand Tour of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of \n\n up to three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than the strongest winds on Earth. Most winds blew westward, opposite the planet's rotation. Separate cloud decks were discovered, with cloud systems emerging and dissolving within hours and giant storms circling the entire planet within sixteen to eighteen hours in the upper layers. Voyager 2 discovered an anticyclone dubbed the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. However, images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994 revealed that the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Also seen in Neptune's upper atmosphere was an almond-shaped spot designated \n\n After Voyager 2 visited Saturn successfully, it was decided to fund further missions to Uranus and Neptune. These missions were conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Neptunian mission was dubbed \"Voyager Neptune Interstellar Mission\". Voyager 2 started taking navigation images of Neptune in May 1988. Voyager 2 observation phase proper of Neptune began 5 June 1989, the spacecraft officially reached the Neptunian system on 25 August, and data collection ceased on 2 October. Initially it was planned to use a trajectory that resulted in Voyager 2 passing around 1,300 km from Neptune and 8,200 km from Triton. The \n\n to avoid ring material detected by stellar occultations prompted this trajectory to be abandoned, and a trajectory that largely avoided the rings but resulted in more distant flybys of both targets was plotted.

The album consists of ten cover versions of various R&B and pop songs and two original songs: \"5 Minutes Away\" and \"Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)\". It was the second of Cole's albums to be released by Verve Records, and her first album in four years, following Ask a Woman Who Knows (2002). Cole promoted the album as a return to her R&B roots, distancing herself from an identification as a jazz artist. Critics gave the album generally positive reviews, praising Cole's interpretations of the covered material, and compared her favorably to contemporary R&B artists. The album peaked at number 97 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, and charted in Germany and Switzerland. It spawned one single – Cole's cover of Aretha Franklin's 1972 song \"Day Dreaming\" – with an accompanying music video. She performed the song at the BET special An Evening of Stars: Tribute to Aretha Franklin. She embarked on a theatre tour in the fall of 2006 to support the album.\n\n Holly & Ivy is a 1994 Christmas album and 16th overall studio album by American singer Natalie Cole. Released on October 4, 1994 by Elektra, it is Cole's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to Take a Look (1993). Cole co-produced the album with American music producer Tommy LiPuma, with whom she had worked on Unforgettable... with Love (1991). Holly & Ivy consists of 12 tracks, including 11 covers of Christmas standards and carols and one original song written by Gerry Goffin and Michael Masser. Cole promoted the album as non-traditional in interviews and live performances. Upon release, critics gave generally positive reviews for Holly & Ivy, praising its composition and Cole's interpretations of the covered material. The album was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 20, 1996 for 500,000 sales shipments; it peaked at number 36 on the Billboard 200 chart. Holly & Ivy spawned one single \"No More Blue Christmas\". In support of the album, Cole filmed a television special, \"Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas\", at State University of New York Performing Arts Center in Purchase, New York; it premiered on WNET on December 7, 1994.\n\n Natalie Walker is an American vocalist, songwriter and musician from Indiana who first came to prominence as part of the group Daughter Darling. While her time in the low-key electronica trip hop outfit was promising, Walker decided on a solo career, and released her first album Urban Angel in 2006, which was produced by the duo Stuhr (Dan Chen and Nate Greenberg). The album made minor waves commercially, but it was a pair of songs from the full-length that helped Walker's career, one of which, a remix of \"Quicksand\", was featured in the Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette, while another, \"Waking Dream\", was featured in the film Circles, made it to television, and was featured in an episode of Grey's Anatomy. Her follow-up, With You, was released in 2008, and also featured production by Stuhr. Walker's EP titled Spark was released on June 21, 2011 via Dorado music and features production by Ted Bruner (Katy Perry, Kesha, Plain White T's) and Dan Chen and Nate Greenberg of Stuhr, the Brooklyn-based production team behind 200'’s With You and her 2006 solo debut.\n\n Wells started her music career in the early 2000s, writing hit single \"Day by Day\" for Point of Grace and co-writing with Plumb for her album Beautiful Lumps of Coal. She independently wrote the song Held, which became a hit single for Natalie Grant on her 2005 Awaken studio album, winning Wells the Dove Award for Songwriter of the Year. Her first solo studio album, Frame the Clouds, was released on June 15, 2009, with Kiss Me Not Publishing. The subsequent release, How Emptiness Sings, an extended play, was released on March 15, 2011. That same year, Wells collaborated with singer/songwriter Nicole Witt to write and record another ep titled Image of God, which was released on December 27, 2011. The duo later added to the Image of God collection, releasing a full-length self-titled album under band name More Than Rubies. Wells released Feed Your Soul, her second full-length studio album, on August 13, 2013. In 2014 she recorded the title song for the film A Long Way Off. In February 2015, Wells released a crowd-funded extended play called Covers, including songs by popular mainstream bands U2, Depeche Mode, Nirvana, The Smiths, and Smashing Pumpkins.\n\n Natalie Walker's third studio album is a captivating blend of electronic and acoustic textures as a foundation for her richly expressive vocals. She wrote and recorded half the album with her previous collaborators Dan Chen and Nate Greenberg, AKA Brooklyn-based production team Stuhr (Mya, Nicole Atkins, Bebel Gilberto), and half with L.A. writer-producer Ted Bruner (Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Plain White T's). The music occupies a sweet spot between pop and electronica, incorporating Moog, vocoders, cellos and pianos into its buttery, evocative mix.

By February, 1914, the NAWSA and the CU had effectively separated into two independent organizations. Blatch merged her Women's Political Union into the CU. That organization in turn became the basis for the National Woman's Party (NWP), which Paul formed in 1916. Once again there were two competing national women's suffrage organizations, but the result this time was something like a division of labor. The NAWSA burnished its image of respectability and engaged in highly organized lobbying at both the national and state levels. The smaller NWP also engaged in lobbying but became increasingly known for activities that were dramatic and confrontational, most often in the national capital.\n\n Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs (NJSFWC) finally endorsed women's suffrage. The Eastern Campaign of the CU held a mass meeting in Atlantic City to discuss their opposition towards Democratic members of the government who were blocking the federal suffrage amendment. By March 1917, the CU changed their name to the National Woman's Party (NWP) New Jersey branch. Members of the NWP picketed the White House as \"Silent Sentinels.\" NWP members represented their state on New Jersey Day, picketing the White House as well as participating in a mass picket of around 1,000 women. As the United States voted to enter World War I, NAWSA leaders decided that suffragists would help support the war effort. The NJWSA began \n\n for the new court structure was the site of the Old Capitol Building. Eminent domain proceedings began swiftly. In 1927, fearing the NWP might lose its headquarters, Alva Vanderbilt Belmont, the NWP's wealthy benefactor and co-founder, paid Senator Dale $100,000 in cash for an option to purchase the Sewall house. The condemnation proceedings went against the party. Although they were initially offered only $100,000 for their property, the NWP protested. In November 1928 the National Woman's Party accepted an award of $299,200 for their existing headquarters in the Old Capitol Prison. Belmont exercised her option, and obtained title to the Sewall house on May 21, 1929. The party announced their purchase of the structure in early September 1929.\n\n there were relatively few college students in the NAWSA. It was established by Maud Wood Park, who later helped create similar groups in 30 states. Park later became a prominent leader of the NAWSA. By 1908, Catt was once again at the forefront of activity. She and her co-workers developed a detailed plan to unite the various suffrage associations in New York City (and later in the entire state) in an organization modeled on political machines like Tammany Hall. In 1909, they founded the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) at a convention attended by over a thousand delegates and alternates. By 1910, the WSP had 20,000 members \n\n The National Woman's Party (NWP) was an American women's political organization formed in 1916 to fight for women's suffrage. After achieving this goal with the 1920 adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the NWP advocated for other issues including the Equal Rights Amendment. The most prominent leader of the National Woman's Party was Alice Paul, and its most notable event was the 1917–1919 Silent Sentinels vigil outside the gates of the White House. As of January 1, 2021, NWP has ceased operations as its own independent non-profit and has assigned its trademark rights and other uses of the party's name to the Alice Paul Institute. The Alice Paul Institute has invited three members of NWP Board of Directors to join their board and in the near future will created a new committee to \"advise on a potential expansion of programs to the Washington, DC area and nationally\".\n\nQuestion: Where was the founder of the National Women's Party born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

With the enactment of the law, over one million women gained the right to vote, doubling the number of women voters nationwide. McCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1913, she became chairman of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. From that headquarters, she was tasked with getting more pro-suffrage candidates elected to state level offices. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, McCormick produced the melodrama Your Girl and Mine, \n\n and no longer held national posts. In 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker Lucy Burns organized the Woman Suffrage Procession, a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration as president. Onlookers who opposed the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public outrage over the incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum. Paul troubled NAWSA leaders by arguing that because Democrats would not act to enfranchise women even though they \n\n Vida Milholland was an ardent suffragist and an active member of the militant National Woman's Party and a political ally of Alice Paul. Along with her sister Inez, she was also a member of the College Equal Suffrage League of New York State. Milholland participated in the picketing of the White House during the first World War in support of women's suffrage. She spent time in Occoquan Workhouse as part of the Silent Sentinels protest. In 1917 Milholland told stories of her imprisonment at the Ritz-Carlton alongside Dora Lewis and others. Alva Belmont presided over this meeting. In 1919 she represented the NWP on their \"Prison Special\" tour of America where she sang at every meeting. At a 1921 conference in Washington, D.C. she was honored for her part in the suffrage movement. Vida dressed in a white Crusader's costume the way Inez used to appear at a memorial for her sister in New York in 1924.\n\n A serious challenge to the NAWSA leadership began to develop after a young activist named Alice Paul returned to the U.S. from England in 1910, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement. She had been jailed there and had endured forced feedings after going on a hunger strike. Joining the NAWSA, she became the person most responsible for reviving interest within the suffrage movement for a national amendment, which for years had been overshadowed by campaigns for suffrage at the state level.  From Shaw's point of view, the time was right for a renewed emphasis on a suffrage amendment. Gordon and Clay, the most persistent adversaries of a federal suffrage amendment within NAWSA, had been out-maneuvered by their \n\n Antoinette Brown Blackwell participated in the parade and was billed as the \"oldest suffragist in the United States.\" After the parade, Van Winkle headed a mass meeting. In 1912, Alice Paul became co-chair of the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Paul, who was a Quaker from New Jersey learned militant suffrage tactics in England. She moved to Washington D.C. and rented a basement room to house the NAWSA committee. By April 1913, Paul and Lucy Burns started the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) to lobby for a federal suffrage amendment.

In the seventeenth century, it became more common especially in England and Scotland to emphasize daily morning and evening services in the home led by fathers to replace the morning and evening prayer services. Puritan minister Richard Baxter gave lengthy instructions in his Christian Directory for family worship. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland added a chapter to the 1647 Westminster Directory for Worship on family prayer shortly after adoption. Matthew Henry \n\n The Presbyterian Reformed Church is a Christian denomination that was founded in Ontario, Canada on November 17, 1965, whose churches continue the historic Scottish Presbyterian orthodoxy in doctrine, worship, government and discipline, on the basis of a conviction that these principles and practices are founded in and are agreeable to the Word of God. The Presbyterian Reformed Church holds to the belief that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the infallible Word of God. The office-bearers must adopt and hold the original 1646 edition of the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Larger Catechism and the Westminster Shorter Catechism as standards subordinate to the Bible. The office-bearers also accept the Westminster Directory of Public Worship as a scriptural and suitable guide in the conduct of public worship. Therefore, psalms are sung in public worship solely and without instrumental accompaniment, and the Scottish Metrical Psalter of 1650 is used solely in the public singing of psalms. The Authorized King James Version of the Bible is the stated text for public reading.\n\n forms of worship, the political and ecclesiastical situation compelled the Puritans, for the sake of liberty, to reject the forms thrust upon them. It was in this context that the Westminster Directory for the Publique Worship of God, devoid of liturgical text, was created in 1644, under the influence of Puritans and separatists. This directory was destined to play the dominant role in shaping the worship of American Presbyterians. It was at this moment in history that Puritans and Scots settled in the New World. They were the nucleus that initially shaped American Presbyterianism. Puritan views thus dominated the way the church took root in American soil.

The act of parliament recognizing the Directory was annulled at the Restoration and the book has never since been acknowledged by a civil authority in Scotland. But General Assemblies have frequently recommended its use, and worship in Presbyterian churches is largely conducted on the lines of the Westminster Assembly's Directory. The subsequent Book of Common Order or Euchologion was a compilation drawn from various sources and issued by the Church Service Society, an organisation which endeavoured to promote liturgical usages within the Church of Scotland.\n\nQuestion: The Directory of Public Worship was approved by a parliament whose modern equivalent has been based where since 2004?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Garfield on September 19, 1881 – after his lengthy incapacity following an assassination attempt – resulted in Vice President Chester Arthur ascending to the presidency. Upon Arthur becoming President, the offices of vice president, president pro tempore of the Senate, and speaker of the House of Representatives were vacant. However, a new president pro tempore of the Senate was named on October 10, 1881, and a new speaker of the House of Representatives was named in December 1881. In 1884, Grover Cleveland was elected president, with Thomas A. Hendricks being elected vice president.

McGonigle attended Temple University and later took a job as a traveling salesman for General Foods. He took an entry-level job at Bachman Bakeries in the 1930s and eventually worked his way up to become CEO of the company; he introduced new manufacturing techniques that allowed the corporation to become the world's largest pretzel manufacturer. McGonigle first became involved in Republican politics when he became party treasurer in 1956, as the organization was searching for someone with business \n\n of Dix. In the 1880 presidential election, William was a presidential elector for President James A. Garfield and Vice-President Chester A. Arthur. In 1891, William was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing Schuyler County. He served in the Assembly in 1892 and 1893. In 1900, Governor Theodore Roosevelt appointed William Commissioner of Watkins Glen State Reservation. Before his death, he was on the board of education and the board of water and sewer commissioners. He was a freemason. William married Mary E. Wickham in 1872. Their four children were George C., Esther W., Robert D., and William B. George was also elected Treasurer of Schuyler County and became president of the Farmers & Merchants' Bank after his father's death. William died on February 15, 1902 from heart failure at home. He was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Watkins Glen.\n\n The 1880 United States presidential election in Vermont took place on November 2, 1880, as part of the 1880 United States presidential election. Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Vermont voted for the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, over the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock. Garfield won Vermont by a margin of 41.66%. With 69.81% of the popular vote, Vermont would be Garfield's strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote. The Republican Vice Presidential nominee Chester Alan Arthur was born in Vermont, more specifically in the town of Fairfield.\n\nThe engraving of Chester A. Arthur appears on the 21-cent value of the 1938 Presidential Series, first issued on November 22, 1938.

A pre-legislative referendum was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions: whether to create a devolved Parliament for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. Following a clear 'yes' vote on both questions in Scotland, a referendum on the proposal for creating a devolved Assembly for Wales was held two weeks later. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. The first general election to the Scottish parliament saw the creation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition with Donald Dewar as First Minister. In Wales, the Labour Party formed a minority government with Alun Michael as the Welsh First Minister. In the 2007 Scottish general election, the Scottish National Party gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader Alex Salmond as First Minister. Devolution also returned to Northern Ireland, leaving England as the only constituent country of the United Kingdom without a devolved administration. Within England, a devolved authority for London was re-established following a 'yes' vote in a London-wide referendum.\n\n received unique treatment was Northern Ireland. On 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court's judgement, designated itself under Schedule4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent.\n\n Many areas of Scots law are legislated for by the Scottish Parliament, in matters devolved from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Areas of Scots law over which the Scottish Parliament has competency include health, education, criminal justice, local government, environment and civil justice amongst others. However, certain powers are reserved to Westminster including defence, international relations, fiscal and economic policy, drugs law, and broadcasting. The Scottish Parliament also has been granted limited tax raising powers. Although technically the Parliament of the United Kingdom retains full power to legislate for Scotland, under the Sewel convention it will not legislate on devolved matters without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament.\n\n at Westminster, London. In 1997 a referendum was held, and the people of Scotland voted for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The new parliament has the power to govern the country on Scotland-specific matters and has a limited power to vary income tax. The United Kingdom Parliament retains responsibility for Scotland's defence, international relations and certain other areas. A Scottish independence referendum was held in September 2014, at which time independence was rejected.

However, since planning is a matter that has been devolved, the Scottish government has the ability to shape the direction of energy generation in Scotland by approving or refusing new projects. In 2004, the Enterprise Committee of the Scottish Parliament called for the development of a 'fully fledged' Scottish energy policy. The SNP Government that took power in May 2007 specifically included the word 'energy' in a portfolio title when the junior ministerial position of Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism was created to replace the position of 'Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning'.\n\nQuestion: Since 2004, what is the location of the body to which, if a matter is not specifically reserved, it is devolved?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Until 1990, Musicworks emphasized post-Cage-an music practices, performance art and graphic scores. Genres covered included avantgarde composition, ethnic music, Acoustic ecology, special tunings and microtonality, improvisation, women's music, genre hybridation, etc. Typical composers interviewed or analysed in the 1978-1987 period were Raymond Murray Schafer, Udo Kasemets, Lou Harrison, Pauline Oliveros, Annea Lockwood, Philip Glass or John Cage, with a lengthy interview published issue #17, in 1981. The cassettes issued with the magazine in the 1980s and 1990s make up about 48 hours of material, and have been the focus of renewed interest in recent years, culminating in an exhibit with listening stations. With issue #48, published in 1990, the journal moved to a 68-page magazine format with a colour cover, and began to focus more on Canadian electroacoustic music and new technologies. The first companion CD appeared in 1992 with issue #52. Today, the magazine is published three times a year by Musicworks Society of Ontario, the official publisher since 2003.

It is an iron bridge dating from the late 19th century. It is the only surviving iron semi-deck lenticular truss bridge in the state, and the only extant of three known to have been built.} In 1977 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shortly afterwards it was closed to vehicular traffic, and at some time later to pedestrians as well. The county had considered demolishing it, but held off after heavy lobbying from local preservation groups. In 2006 it was reconstructed and restored with federal and state grants, and reopened without any load restrictions.\n\n The Beaver River Bridge (also called \"Beaver Valley Bridge\") is a bridge that carries the Pennsylvania Turnpike across the Beaver River in North Sewickley Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Built in 1951 and opened in 1952, the 70-year-old bridge is being redesigned with construction of a new span not expected to begin until 2020 or later. The Beaver River Bridge has a total length of 1546 ft and a clearance below of 170 ft making it higher than the Delaware River Bridge's 160 ft clearance on the PA Turnpike's eastern terminus in Bucks County, but lower than the Hawk Falls Bridge's 190 ft clearance on the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Northeast Extension in Carbon County. The Beaver River Bridge is an example of a mid-20th century cantilever deck truss with preservation groups making efforts to save it from demolition as its structural style is becoming rare. About 20,000 vehicles travel across the bridge each day.\n\n The Watts Mill Bridge is a pin-connected Pratt pony truss bridge located over the Little Beaver Creek in Cannelton, Pennsylvania, United States. The bridge was constructed in 1878 by the West Penn Bridge Company, based in nearby Beaver Falls PA. The bridge is located in a valley approximately a 1/8 mile west of the North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge and adjacent Mill remains were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. When the bridge was given this designation by the NRHP, it was simply known as the Bridge in South Beaver Township. It is the only bridge in Beaver \n\n nineteen bridges remaining in Pennsylvania using the Town lattice, and the Waterford Covered Bridge is only one in Erie County. It is the also the only covered bridge in the county to have been painted, with the exterior of the bridge painted barn red. The bridge also has \"an unusual, blue, metal pipe structure\" attached to the abutments on the bridge's south side. The structure is supported with a king post framework and, presumably, connects to nearby pipelines. Originally, a white sign was mounted above each portal that declared \"Old Kissing Bridge built in 1875 by the Phelps Bros.\" Sometime in the mid-2000s, the sign was taken down. When the bridge was closed, large \"Bridge Closed\" signs were mounted in the same location with concrete barricades placed across the road on the bridge's approaches.\n\n The bridge is located just above where the Sacandaga flows into the Hudson River opposite the village of Lake Luzerne, and just south of the central portions of Hadley. It is within the Adirondack Park's Blue Line. The river flows rapidly through a deep gorge here, with its sides sloping steeply from the road grade. An abandoned rail bridge (now reactivated as of 2016) is just upstream, and an interpretive panel is located near the bridge. The bridge is supported by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other. The 45 ft span at the south end is an end-post three-panel pony truss with both cast and wrought iron elements.

In addition to the body, each person had a šwt (shadow), a ba (personality or soul), a ka (life-force), and a name. The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions.

The airport is on the Pacific coast, 18 km down the coast from Pichilemu. The runway slope rises to the northeast. Southwest approach and departure are over the water.\n\n Early modern architecture started to appear in newer buildings in the 1930s such as art nouveau. During the time, Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves was director of public works for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, he also lived in Cape Verde for some years, he did architectural works including the terminal and facilities of the Sal International Airport (now known as Amílcar Cabral International Airport), Farol de Fiúra in the north point (Ponta Norte) of Sal, an urban plan for the square now known as 5 do Outubro in Praia. There were hardly any building projects in Cape Verde during the Great Depression and the Famine of the 1940s and remained up until the 1950s. A town founded for airport services, the center of Espargos once known as Preguiça features late colonial and early modern architecture, one of its buildings is the Sal Municipal Hall. Several Mormon and Protestant churches built before independence have modern architecture. Other buildings built during that time included Estádio da Fontinha (now Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena) in Mindelo and Liceu Domingos Ramos in the north of the plateau. Seminaro de São José, located near Ponta Temerosa, Praia was also built during that time.\n\nGVAC (SID) &ndash; Amílcar Cabral International Airport &ndash; Espargos, Sal ; GVAN (NTO) &ndash; Agostinho Neto Airport (closed) &ndash; Ponta do Sol, Santo Antão ; GVBA (BVC) &ndash; Aristides Pereira International Airport &ndash; Rabil, Boa Vista ; GVMA (MMO) &ndash; Maio Airport &ndash; Vila do Maio, Maio ; GVMT (MTI) &ndash; Mosteiros Airport (closed) &ndash; Mosteiros, Fogo ; GVNP (RAI) &ndash; Praia International Airport &ndash; Santiago, Praia ; GVSF (SFL) &ndash; São Filipe Airport &ndash; São Filipe, Fogo ; GVSN (SNE) &ndash; São Nicolau Airport &ndash; Preguiça, São Nicolau ; GVSV (VXE) &ndash; Cesária Évora Airport &ndash; São Pedro, São Vicente \n\n TACV Cabo Verde Airlines, the national airline, flies weekly from Boston Logan International Airport to Praia International Airport at Praia Santiago island.

It was about the size of a dime and it looked like a scar. I couldn't remember ever having injured my leg there, and I studied it, trying to figure out what it was. Some time later I was in Birmingham to see my doctor about a thyroid problem, and I thought to show it to him. He couldn't figure it out either, but he said he wasn't a dermatologist; he suggested I put a little Vaseline on it and watch it. A few months later it was about the size of a quarter and still growing, and it had started to change color, to get darker. I went over to a dermatologist in Decatur, and he diagnosed me as soon as he saw it. I can say that I'm one of the few cases that ever got a diagnosis so soon; I've met a lot of people since then who have scleroderma, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other things like that, and every one of them got diagnosed with something else before their doctors finally got it right. The doctor told me a couple of interesting things about scleroderma: he said it's a rare disease, that it's even rarer for someone my age to get it, and rarer yet because I am a man. Most victims are twenty to forty years old, and 80 percent of them are women. He said to me, \"I'll bet you thought you had cancer.\" I said, \"Well, I've seen enough cancer patients in my life, and I did think that's what it was.\" \"No, it's scleroderma,\" he said. \"I'm not going to biopsy it because the wound will never heal up. But that's what it is.\"He said he didn't know of anyone who had ever gotten over it, and he didn't know any place I could go to see a doctor who could give me any help.\"But I will tell you this,\" he said.\"Before it's over, you're going to wish it had been cancer instead.\"I asked him why he said that.I told him the little amount I had on my leg didn't hurt at all, and I had heard that cancer was really painful.\n\n a narrative of the events: \"I was avoided as a pestilence; the waves of sorrow rolled over me, and beat me down with multiplied force; every one came heavier than the last. My children were distressed. My wife, through long affliction, ready to quit my own arms for those of death; and I myself reduced to the sad necessity of humbly begging a draught of water at a cottage!...In the morning of the 15th I was a rich man; in the evening I was ruined.\" When the rioters arrived at John Taylor's other house at Moseley, Moseley Hall, they carefully moved all of the furniture and \n\n fifty rioters who had been charged were ever brought to trial; four were convicted, of whom one was pardoned, two were hanged, and the fourth was transported to Botany Bay. But Priestley and others believed that these men were found guilty not because they were rioters but because \"they were infamous characters in other respects\". Although he had been forced to send troops to Birmingham to quell the disturbances, King George III commented, \"I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light.\" The \n\n government forced the local residents to pay restitution to those whose property had been damaged: the total eventually amounted to £23,000. However, the process took many years, and most residents received much less than the value of their property. After the riots, Birmingham was, according to industrialist James Watt, \"divided into two parties who hate one another mortally\". Initially Priestley wanted to return and deliver a sermon on the Bible verse \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" but he was dissuaded by friends convinced that it was too dangerous. Instead, he wrote his Appeal: \"I was born an Englishman as \n\n or with which they were bribed to stop burning homes. A small core could not be bribed, however, and remained sober. The rioters burned not only the homes and chapels of Dissenters, but also the homes of people they associated with Dissenters, such as members of the scientific Lunar Society. While the riots were not initiated by Prime Minister William Pitt's administration, the national government was slow to respond to the Dissenters' pleas for help. Local officials seem to have been involved in the planning of the riots, and were later reluctant to prosecute ringleaders. Industrialist James Watt wrote that the riots \"divided [Birmingham] into two parties who hate one another mortally\". Those who had been attacked gradually left, leaving Birmingham a more conservative city than previously.\n\nQuestion: Where was the person who wrote about the rioting being a dividing factor in Birmingham educated?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The 86C911 spawned a host of imitators: by 1995, all major PC graphics chip makers had added 2D acceleration support to their chips. By this time, fixed-function Windows accelerators had surpassed expensive general-purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance, and these coprocessors faded away from the PC market. Throughout the 1990s, 2D GUI acceleration continued to evolve. As manufacturing capabilities improved, so did the level of integration of graphics chips. Additional application programming interfaces (APIs) arrived for a variety of tasks, such \n\n The R4200 is a microprocessor designed by MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MTI) that implemented the MIPS III instruction set architecture (ISA). It was also known as the VRX during development. The microprocessor was licensed to NEC, and the company fabricated and marketed it as the VR4200. The first VR4200, an 80 MHz part, was introduced in 1993. A faster 100 MHz part became available in 1994. The R4200 was developed specifically for low-power Windows NT computers such as personal computers and laptops. MTI claimed the microprocessor's integer performance was greater than that of the widely known Intel i486 and 80% of a P5-variant Pentium microprocessor. The R4200 ultimately did not see any use in personal computers and was repositioned as an embedded microprocessor that competed with the R4600. The R4300i variant was used in the widely popular Nintendo 64 video game console.\n\n output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter, and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic. There was to be a store (that is, a memory) capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each (ca. 16.6 kB). An arithmetic unit (the \"mill\") would be able to perform all four arithmetic operations, plus comparisons and optionally square roots. Initially (1838) it was conceived as a difference engine curved back upon itself, in a generally circular layout, with the long store exiting off to one side. Later drawings (1858) depict a regularised grid layout. Like the central processing unit (CPU) \n\n Gerbrand Ceder received an engineering degree in Metallurgy and Applied Materials Science from the University of Leuven, Belgium, in 1988, and a Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1991 at which time he joined the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was the R.P. Simmons Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 25 years, after which he moved back to the U. C. Berkeley, where he remains. His research group focuses on the use of computational modeling to design novel materials for energy generation and storage, including battery cathodes, hydrogen storage materials, thermoelectrics, and electrodes for solar photoelectrochemical water-splitters. His group also designs, synthesizes and characterizes novel lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery chemistries. He has published over 400 scientific papers in the fields of alloy theory, oxide phase stability, high-temperature superconductors, Li-battery materials, machine learning, and theory of materials synthesis, and holds 25 current or pending U.S. patents. In 2009, ByungWoo Kang and Gerbrand Ceder demonstrated that the lithium ion battery cathode material LiFePO4 could undergo ultrafast charging and discharging (~10 sec full discharge).\n\n From 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875. Percy Ludgate wrote about the engine in 1914 and published his own design for an Analytical Engine in 1908. It was drawn up in detail, but never built, and the drawings have never been found. Ludgate's engine would be much smaller (about 8 cuft) than Babbage's, and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20-decimal-digit numbers in about six seconds. In his Essays on Automatics (1913) Leonardo Torres y Quevedo designed a Babbage type of calculating machine that used electromechanical parts which included floating point number \n\nQuestion: Where was the designer of the Lap Engine educated?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Surfactant additives offer flexibility in enhancing the properties of fuel at a minimal cost. They have been found to reduce losses from gasoline evaporation, improve the mixture formation during injection into the engine, and enhance detergent and anticorrosive properties. \n\nBy reducing losses from gasoline evaporation, surfactant additives help decrease emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere. VOCs contribute to air pollution and can have harmful effects on human health. \n\nImproving the mixture formation during injection into the engine leads to better combustion efficiency, resulting in improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. A well-mixed fuel-air mixture ensures optimal combustion, which translates to better engine performance and reduced emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. \n\nFurthermore, the detergent and anticorrosive properties of surfactant additives help keep the engine and fuel system clean, preventing the buildup of deposits and reducing the risk of engine component damage. This can lead to improved engine longevity and reliability.\n\nOverall, the introduction of surfactant additives into gasoline contributes to improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions of pollutants, and better engine performance and reliability, thus helping to enhance both the environmental and performance characteristics of vehicles.\n\nRich air-fuel ratio requirement in cold engines: When a cold engine is started, the fuel does not vaporize completely, creating higher emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, which diminishes only as the engine reaches operating temperature. The duration of this start-up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology, including computer-controlled fuel injection, shorter intake lengths, and pre-heating of fuel and/or inducted air. ; Inefficient catalytic converter under cold conditions: Catalytic converters are very inefficient until warmed up to their operating temperature. This time has been much reduced by moving the converter closer to the exhaust manifold and even more so placing a small yet quick-to-heat-up converter directly at the exhaust manifold. The small converter handles the start-up emissions, which allows enough time for the larger main converter to heat up. Further improvements can be realised in many ways, including electric heating, thermal battery, chemical reaction preheating, flame heating and superinsulation. During the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours, the amount of emissions can be very high. This occurs for two main reasons:\n\n In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated regulations requiring all new or refurbished diesel locomotives to meet Tier II pollution standards that slash the amount of allowable soot by 90% and require an 80% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. See List of low emissions locomotives. Other technologies that are being deployed to reduce locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include \"Genset\" switching locomotives and hybrid Green Goat designs. Genset locomotives use multiple smaller high-speed diesel engines and generators (generator sets), rather than a single medium-speed diesel engine and a single generator. Because of the cost of developing clean engines, these smaller high-speed engines are based on already developed truck engines. Green Goats are a type of hybrid switching locomotive utilizing a small diesel engine and a large bank of rechargeable batteries. Switching locomotives are of particular concern as they typically operate in a limited area, often in or near urban centers, and spend much of their time idling. Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.\n\n KIVA is a family of Fortran-based Computational Fluid Dynamics software developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The software predicts complex fuel and air flows as well as ignition, combustion, and pollutant-formation processes in engines. The KIVA models have been used to understand combustion chemistry processes, such as auto-ignition of fuels, and to optimize diesel engines for high efficiency and low emissions. General Motors has used KIVA in the development of direct-injection, stratified charge gasoline engines as well as the fast burn, homogeneous-charge gasoline engine. Cummins reduced development time and cost by 10%–15% using KIVA to develop its high-efficiency 2007 ISB 6.7-L diesel engine that was able to meet 2010 emission standards in 2007. At the same time, the company realized a more robust design and improved fuel economy while meeting all environmental and customer constraints.\n\n Automakers use engine downsizing to help improve vehicles’ fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, and use turbocharger technology to recover power lost in the downsizing process. The presence of LSPI limits automakers’ ability to capture the full potential of turbocharged engines to meet increasing fuel-efficiency requirements and to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Updated oil-performance standards are taking shape to address LSPI. General Motors’ next-generation dexos1 specification, scheduled for release in 2015, will include an engine test based on a GM 2.0-liter four-cylinder Ecotec that will test for LSPI. The proposed ILSAC GF-6 standard will also include a test for oil-related LSPI events in gasoline direct-injection engines based on a Ford 2.0 L four-cylinder Ecoboost engine.\n\nQuestion: Where was the creator of the Lap Engine educated?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The competition has been held since 1959. Between 1959 and 1978, the tournament was held annually (without qualification); since 1980, it has been held every two years. The 1980 AFC Youth Championship had a qualification stage for first time. The tournament has been played in a number of different formats during its existence. Currently, it consists of two stages, similar to the AFC's other Asian Championship competitions. The qualifying stage is open to all AFC members and the final stage is contested between 16 teams. The most recent edition, the 40th, was held in Indonesia. The AFC have proposed switching the tournament from under-19 to under-20 starting from 2023. Moreover, the tournament will also be rebranded from the \"AFC U-19 Championship\" to the \"AFC U-20 Asian Cup\".\n\n The 1967 Australia Cup was the sixth season of the Australia Cup, which was the main national association football knockout cup competition in Australia. Sixteen clubs from around Australia qualified to enter the competition.\n\n The RCD Cup 1967 was the second edition of the RCD Cup tournament, held in Dhaka, East Pakistan in 1967.

In 1959, the Malaya Cup departed from the traditional one round tournament to a two-round home and away format in three zones, East, South and North. FAM changed its name to Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) in the early 1960s to inline with the formation of Malaysia. A new trophy for Malaya Cup was inaugurated in 1967, and since then the competition has been known as the Malaysia Cup. Starting in 1974, the state teams were barred from entering the FAM Cup competition and only the club sides could enter. In 1976 Penang is the first club from Malaysia won Asian title Aga Khan Gold Cup unofficial Asian Champions' Cup.\n\n The 1967 Asian Champion Club Tournament was the first edition of the annual Asian club football competition hosted by Asian Football Confederation. Originally it was meant to be eight teams in the competition but after the Indian and Iranian teams withdrew, the six domestic champions competed in a knockout tournament to determine the first Asian champion. Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C. from Israel became the first champions of Asia after defeating Selangor FA from Malaysia 2–1 in the final at Bangkok, one of only 2 teams to win their continent's main club competition while only playing 1 game (The other being Adelaide City, who won the 1987 Oceania Club Championship.)\n\nQuestion: The 1967 Federation Cup is an instance of this tournament which is named after what organization?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Open to all nations the competition became a resounding success. The inaugural event attracted 16 countries. The competition was supported by the top players right from the start. Held at the Queen's Club, in London, the first contest was between Australia and the United States. Grand Slam champions Darlene Hard, Billie Jean King, Margaret Smith and Lesley Turner all proudly representing their country on court. The United States would emerge the champion nation in the opening year. However, it was to be Australia in the early years, winning seven of the next eleven championships. Around 1980 the United States was able to establish some significant mark on \n\n Shaw, in which they were defeated in three sets by eventual champions Billie-Jean King and Betty Stöve. Williams competed in the Wightman Cup, a women's team tennis competition between the United States and Great Britain, in 1967, 1970, 1971 and 1972. She was also a member of the British Federation Cup team, playing a total of nine ties in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973 and compiling a 6–5 win-loss record. Williams won nine singles titles at the Scottish Championships and shared the title with Corinne Molesworth in 1972. In addition, she won the German Indoor Championships in 1968, defeating Helga Niessen in the final, and the Scandinavian title in 1970. After her retirement as a player in 1976, she became a tennis coach and BBC radio commentator.\n\n The 1972 Davis Cup was the 61st edition of the Davis Cup, the most important tournament between national teams in men's tennis. 55 teams would enter the competition, 33 in the Europe Zone, 11 in the Americas Zone, and 11 in the Eastern Zone. In this year's tournament the Challenge Round was abolished, resulting in the previous year's champion now playing in all matches rather than receiving a bye to the final. Going forward the winner of the Inter-Zonal Zone would now be declared the Davis Cup champion. The United States defeated Chile in the Americas Inter-Zonal final, Australia defeated India in the Eastern Inter-Zonal final, and Romania and Spain were the winners of the two Europe Zones, defeating the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia respectively. In the Inter-Zonal Zone, the United States defeated Spain and Romania defeated Australia in the semifinals. The United States then defeated Romania in the final, giving the United States their fifth straight title. The final was played at the Club Sportiv Progresul in Bucharest, Romania on 13–15 October.\n\n The Billie Jean King Cup is the premier international team competition in women's tennis, launched as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The name was changed to the Fed Cup in 1995, and changed again in September 2020 in honor of former World No. 1 Billie Jean King. The Billie Jean King Cup is the world's largest annual women's international team sports competition in terms of the number of nations that compete. The current Chairperson is Katrina Adams. The relatively small nation of Czech Republic dominated the Fed Cup in the 2010s, as the Czechs won six of ten competitions in the decade. The men's equivalent of the Billie Jean King Cup is the Davis Cup, and the Czech Republic, Australia, Russia and the United States are the only countries to have held both Cups at the same time.\n\n The 1972 Federation Cup was the tenth edition of the most important competition between national teams in women's tennis. 31 nations participated in the tournament, which was held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, South Africa from 20–25 March. South Africa defeated Great Britain in the final, in what was the first final not featuring United States or Australia, giving South Africa their first title. South Africa became the first team other than United States or Australia to win the Fed Cup.\n\nQuestion: What is the competition the 1972 Federation Cup is part of named after?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cherry Grove is owned today by descendants of the granddaughter of James Surget, Jr., Mrs. Douglas MacNeil, philanthropist and former national president of the Girl Scouts of the USA. In September 1861, a group of planters rounded up slaves after hearing rumors they schemed to “kill their masters”, and “ravish”, “ride” and “take the ladies for wives”.

D.J. Abernathy, pastor early in the church beginnings, said the following at a building dedication in 1966: \"What shall our interest be in the future? It must be what it has always been, people.  We must see them as the compassionate Savior saw them, and we must bring them into His presence at every opportunity.\" This vision grew as Hickory Grove started a satellite location in northern Mecklenburg County in 1995. As of August, 2009 the church has grown to over 18,000 members and is the second largest Baptist church in North Carolina.

She lived growing up with her older sister Agnès, her mother, and her maternal grandmother. It was not until much later, when TV5 Monde was filming a report in Burundi, that she got back in touch with her father, the former director of Burundi's national television. The reunion was disappointing. Her father died of AIDS two years later.

As an actress, she is most notable for her portrayal of Guinevere in Robert Bresson's film Lancelot du lac (1974). She grew up in France in the artistic and film-making milieu of her mother, who was struggling with mental distress. Her parents separated by mutual agreement in 1960, and she and her brother Philip went to live with her father. She married Laurent Condominas, a model and photographer linked to the \"Zanzibar Films\" collective of avant garde French film-makers, also known as the \n\n their very first arena tour, Delirium. She left the show in May. She appears on the show's album, which was released in June 2006. In 2011, Jacynthe released her fifth studio album, Dévoile qui tu es, her first in eight years. She is now in studio to record her follow-up English album. In 2012, her song \"Feel\" featuring Victoria Duffield peaked at No. 1 on the Tops 25 Radio BDS Francophone. In May 2021, Jacynthe has been a running candidate for Quebec political faction, Action Laval running under her political campaign associate and party leader, Sophie Trottier. Jacynthe is married to her husband, Carlo, and they have a daughter.\n\n Born into a wealthy Jewish family as a banker's daughter, she married Albert Arman. Arman's mother's maiden name was Caillavet and so they called themselves Arman de Caillavet. They had one child, the playwright Gaston Arman de Caillavet. Neither of them was faithful to the other, though they never divorced. Beautiful in her youth, with clear blue eyes, black hair, and a mocking mouth, she was intelligent, cultivated and spoke four languages. She often attended the salons of Lydie Aubernon and it was there that she met Anatole France, in 1883. From 1888 there followed years of a passionate, exclusive liaison between the pair, often all the stormier for the jealousy of both parties. She inspired his Thaïs (1890) and Le Lys rouge (1894).\n\n Born in Aix-en-Provence to a French father and a Haitian mother, Daudet, impregnated with two cultures, began her training at the Aix-en-Provence Conservatory with Michel Bourdoncle.

He was the younger of two brothers. Because his father worked in Shanghai for the office of the research department of the Manchurian Railway, Hiroshi was born Japanese in Shanghai. In 1929, his mother returned to Japan with him and his elder brother. He attended Seino Elementary School and Tokyo Prefectural Junior High School No. 7, where he studied piano under Nori Tanaka, Eiichi Hagiwara and Naotoshi Fukui. He attended Tokyo Prefectural Shichi Junior High School. As a junior high school student at an event marking the anniversary of the death of a former Tennō, he played Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu to great acclaim. At the Tokyo Music School, he was a sought-after piano accompanist. He often practised for about 10 hours a day to improve his technique. After obtaining his high school diploma, he enrolled and graduated from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. After graduating he performed vigorously, playing solos, concerts to earn money for solo concerts and overseas studies.\n\n Born in Munich, Germany, Hamauzu's mother was a piano teacher and his father, Akimori Hamauzu, an opera singer. He developed an interest in music while in kindergarten. Hamauzu grew up in Germany and started to receive piano and singing lessons from his parents at very young age, and when he was in high school, he composed his first original music piece. After his brother, Hiroshi, was born, the family moved to Osaka. He enrolled in the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, where he joined a student ensemble as a pianist. Hamauzu met his wife, Matsue Hamauzu (née Fukushi), at the university, and they have two children. Matsue worked alongside Hamauzu on the soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII as a soprano and Sigma Harmonics as a scat singer; she was also a soprano for the score to Final Fantasy VIII & a lead vocalist in Final Fantasy XIII. After graduating from the university, he thought about becoming a classical musician, but he eventually found out that he wanted to work with game music instead.\n\n Ayuo Takahashi was born in Tokyo, and spent his early childhood traveling in Germany, Sweden and France with his parents. His father, Yuji Takahashi, is a composer of contemporary classical music and a pianist known for premiering works by Iannis Xenakis and John Cage. Ayuo and his parents settled in New York City in 1966. Ayuo grew up listening to both the new avant-garde experimental and contemporary music and the psychedelic rock music of the 1960s. He often went to museums, art galleries and cinemas to see exhibitions of contemporary art and the new cinema. At the same time, he also saw Japanese traditional Noh plays, and heard ancient and medieval music from \n\n Oki Kano (加納 沖), known professionally as OKI, is a Japanese musician of Ainu ancestry.

This assistance was possible only because of the generous support MCK receives from individuals and organizations. Our sincere thanks to you all.\nAmong the children for whom MCK provided financial assistance over the six months from January-June were 3 year old Nada and 10-year-old Siti Aisyah, both of whom are suffering from Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone or soft tissue cancer, and 15-year-old Rizki Rifalah, pictured with his mother, who has brain germinoma, a type of germ cell tumor.\nDemand for assistance looks set to rise due to the expansion of the children’s cancer ward that will more than double its capacity. While this will have implications for our costs we are delighted that the ward is going to be able to treat many more children – with the 15 beds currently available being supplemented by 17 more – particularly as there is almost always a waiting list for admission. Building work on the additional bed space is currently in process and is due for completion in September, with the new ward set to be up and running in October.\nAugust will see the arrival of Jane Peski, a pediatric oncology nurse from The Academic Medical Centre (AMC), the most prominent medical centre in the Netherlands and one of its largest hospitals. She will be conducting two week basic and advanced training programs at Dharmais Hospital for nurses from across the country.\nThe case of baby Farida offers an example of the positive impact that MCKs assistance can provide to babies in need of urgent medical care. Farida was born premature, at just 37 weeks and weighing only 1560 grams. Upon birth she was found to have Gastroschisis, or abdominal hernia, an abdominal wall defect in which the intestines develop outside the abdomen through an opening in the abdominal wall. She needed an immediate operation to push the intestines back into the abdomen and seal the opening, but with her father working as a driver and earning just Rp. 600,000/month and without any form of insurance, her family had no chance of being able to cover the cost of the operation themselves. MCK was able to respond immediately to their request for assistance and the operation was conducted. Two weeks later Farida was stable enough to be moved out of the intensive care unit and within five weeks her parents were able to take her home.\nMCK is happy that so many of our supporters find time to visit the children in the wards we work with at Cipto and Dharmais. The photo below, shows Barbara and Heidi from Die Brucke along with six street children supported by Die Brucke who in turn, visit Cipto weekly to cuddle & feed babies in the ward.\nMCK volunteers were delighted to host a dinner recently for Professor Veerman, a pediatric oncologist from the Netherlands. Through a cancer foundation in the Netherlands, the Queen Wilhelmina Fund, Professor Veerman has been providing assistance to children’s oncology wards in Yogyakarta, Semarang, Medan and Manado. Dr. Edi Tehuteru from Dharmais Hospital, who has known Professor Veerman for some time, also joined the dinner.\nFor the past four years, MCK has organized an outing to Ragunan Zoo in Jakarta to coincide with the annual zoo run organized by Jakarta Free Spirit. This represents a rare opportunity for children receiving treatment at “Dharmais” hospital to enjoy a day out with their families and has always been a popular event. This year was no exception, with the number of families joining being the highest yet: together with volunteers the MCK group numbered 115 people! Many thanks to everyone who came along and also to the organizers of the zoo run for their help and support.\nWe were very sorry to have to say farewell to Astrid, an MCK volunteer for the past two years, who has recently returned to the Netherlands, but wish her and her family lots of luck and happiness in their new adventure.\nAs the holiday season and year end approaches, Mary’s Cancer Kiddies (MCK) volunteers would like to say a special thank you to our generous supporters and to wish you and your families all the very best for 2009. Thanks to your help, we have been able to continue our work with children suffering from cancer and infectious diseases, and prematurely born babies.\nWorking with children with cancer in any country is very grueling and in Indonesia, where children generally come in for treatment only after their cancer is well advanced and the prognosis is often consequently bleak, this is all the more true.\nSometimes, though, the least hopeful cases can surprise even the most experienced cancer specialists, as the case of six-year-old Siskawati demonstrates. When her family brought her in for treatment for a tumor on her retina a year ago her cancer was already stage IV, as the cancer had already spread to her brain, and her prognosis was very poor. Fortunately, even though her chances of survival were very slim, Siskawati’s family went ahead with the recommended treatment, including the removal of her eye and, after several cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer cells in her brain died. Today, little Siskawati is doing well and she is in the process of being fitted with a prosthetic eye funded by MCK, thanks to two of our generous supporters.\nMCK has also provided financial assistance to dozens of other children at Dharmais hospital. They include 14-year-old Rico, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Rico’s family had applied for financial assistance from the government insurance scheme for low income families, Askeskin, to cover the cost of his treatment, but the severe nature of his illness meant that treatment could not wait until the insurance cover was in place. The family sold their modest house in order to cover some of the treatment costs and MCK also provided assistance by paying for medicine and an MRI.\nThe onerous cost of treatment not only causes families to go into chronic debt, it can also lead them to decide not to continue with treatment, with usually devastating consequences. One family whose son, Alfonsus, was diagnosed with cancer nearly did just that. Having struggled to pay for six chemotherapy treatments they had no funds left to cover the cost of the four remaining cycles of chemotherapy needed, and staff at the hospital feared that they may give up and decide to stop the treatment as a result. Fortunately, MCK was able to step in and offer support and Alfonsus went on to complete his treatment.\nAt Cipto hospital many families face the same dilemma as those at Dharmais and MCK therefore works closely with the doctors and nurses to provide assistance to those most in need. Among the children who have received MCK support at Cipto hospital in recent months are 6-year-old Zaenab and 15-month-old Zaki, both suffering from Leukaemia, and 6-year-old Vina, who has a tumor on her retina.\nIn recent months, MCK has provided support for hundreds of premature babies being treated in the neonatal ward at Cipto hospital. For the poorest families the unanticipated costs associated with the medical care needed for a premature baby are often overwhelming. In the most desperate cases, parents abandon their newly born infants at the hospital because they are unable to pay the bills.\nMCK continues to provide financial assistance for children in the infectious ward, many of whom are also suffering from malnutrition. The photo below shows doctors and nurses from the ward.\nWhile MCK would not be able to do the work we do without the money generously provided by our donors, MCK is delighted that their kindness so often also extends to taking the time to visit the children and show their concern for them and their families.\nJIS students have continued to pay visits the children’s cancer ward at Dharmais to spend time with the children and, in April, two of them joined Dan Roberts of Clowns without Borders/ Hidung Merah Circus to entertain them.\nBritish Women’s Association (BWA) volunteers have been regular visitors to Cipto hospital. The photo below shows two of them, Chris and Penny, preparing to give out to those undergoing treatment school bags, books and pencils donated by BIS students.\nFor those of you who like pizza and would also like to contribute to the work of MCK, why not try a Priscilla pizza? For each one sold, Izzi Pizza donates Rp. 1,000 to the Priscilla Hall Memorial Foundation. The Foundation matches each Rp. 1,000 and the proceeds go to MCK. Don Hall, who runs the foundation set up in his daughter’s name, at the children’s cancer ward of Cipto, is pictured here with MCK volunteer, Julie, and two ward doctors.\nMCK volunteers were deeply saddened by the death in May of Nina, dedicated Dharmais hospital children’s cancer ward volunteer. She is much missed.\nGreetings once again from Mary’s Cancer Kiddies volunteers! Six months have gone by since our last newsletter. Our work with children suffering from cancer continues, and we include in this newsletter a summary of the assistance we have provided during this period. In this newsletter, though, we have decided to focus primarily on the support MCK has been providing to the infectious ward at Cipto hospital in Jakarta.\nOur assistance to the infectious ward at Cipto hospital began in June 2007 in response to requests from doctors there. Funding for this support has been specially earmarked by the sponsor to provide modest financial assistance to cover one-off costs for children suffering from infectious diseases and other ailments other then cancer.\nIllnesses treated at the ward include tetanus, HIV, tuberculosis, acute diarrhea and malnutrition. Costs per diagnoses or treatment are on average Rp 90.000 (€ 7). The illnesses from which the children are suffering have often been made worse as a result of reluctance on the part of poor families to seek treatment, for fear of the high cost of doing so. Even those who are eligible to have their children’s costs covered often have to pay for initial treatments before the insurance scheme comes into effect, and this can cause considerable difficulties for families living on or close to the poverty line. MCK therefore covers costs of treatment for these children pending completion of necessary paperwork for the government insurance scheme.\nAmong those MCK has assisted is Andrian, a three- month-old boy, who was brought into the hospital in late December with acute diarrhoea and prolonged fever due to a suspected urinary tract infection. He was also undernourished. During Andrian’s hospital stay, his father was unable to work — he is a motorcycle taxi driver – as he stayed with his son in the hospital while his wife stayed at home with their other child. The picture shows Andrian’s father keeping his son’s spirits up with a New Year paper trumpet.\nNursiyifah, a four- month-old girl, was admitted on the last day of the year with acute diarrhoea, encephalitis due to suspected HIV, and a suspected urinary tract infection. MCK helped by covering the cost of several lab examinations as well as medication for this little girl.\nRaditya, a one-month-old baby girl came to the ward at the beginning of the year with anemia due to suspected iron deficiency. She also lacked immunization. Due to the long holiday break, her family were unable to get the costs covered by Askeskin insurance, so the necessary lab examinations and vaccinations were paid for by MCK.\nGood news for Jabal (eight years old) who recovered from a high fever due to sepsis and typhoid and was able to go home in January. MCK paid for his blood test and medicine.\nValencia, a ten-month-old girl, came into the hospital with broncho-pneumonia and was also undernourished.

In Chicago, in 1979, Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris) is a priest, now a Postulator, who investigates claims of miracles for the Vatican performed by a devout woman whose death caused a statue of the Virgin Mary to bleed upon and cure a girl with terminal lupus. Now the woman has been nominated for sainthood. Having never encountered a genuine miracle, he is known as the \"Miracle Killer\" for his track record for debunking false claims of miracles. Father Frank is suffering a crisis of faith when he is sent to investigate the miracles of a woman, the late Helen O'Regan who has been nominated for sainthood, and winds up becoming the greatest advocate for her canonization.

The name of the division was changed to HP Networking in September 2010 after HP bought 3Com Corporation.\n\n As the company began to grow, it became HP Products, and started to diversify its product lines and acquire organizations to meet the changing needs of its customers. In 2000, Shuel's daughter, Bridget Shuel-Walker, assumed the role of President. In 2009, HP Products was valued at $150 million.\n\n late 2006, HP had retaken the #1 sales position of PCs from Dell, which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality, and held that rank until supplanted in the mid-2010s by Lenovo. Most Compaq products have been re-branded with the HP nameplate, such as the company's market leading ProLiant server line (now owned by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which spun off from HP in 2015), while the Compaq brand was repurposed for some of HP's consumer-oriented and budget products, notably Compaq Presario PCs. HP's business computers line was discontinued in favour of the Compaq Evo line, which was rebranded HP Compaq. HP's Jornada PDAs were replaced by Compaq iPAQ PDAs, \n\n The Compaq Evo was a series of business PCs (desktop and laptop) and thin clients made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard (following the 2002 merger). The Evo brand was introduced by Compaq in May 2001 as a business-oriented brand, replacing the Deskpro brand of desktops and the Armada brand of notebooks. Evo was rebranded as HP Compaq, which was used until 2013.\n\n Compaq originally competed directly against IBM, manufacturing computer systems equivalent with the IBM PC, as well as Apple Computer. In the 1990s, as IBM's own PC division declined, Compaq faced other IBM PC Compatible manufacturers like Dell Computer, Packard Bell, AST Research, and Gateway 2000. By the mid-1990s, Compaq's price war had enabled it to overtake IBM and Apple, while other IBM PC Compatible manufacturers such as Packard Bell and AST were driven from the market. Dell became the number-one supplier of PCs in 2001. At the time of their 2002 merger, Compaq and HP were the second and third largest \n\nQuestion: In 2002, what company merged with the top PC manufacturer from 1994?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The neighborhood around the estuary is also known as Clam Bayou. The area is popular with kayakers. It is also home to the 10-acre Clam Bayou Nature Park that includes a canoe and kayak launch point. Trash, sediments, and pollution have become a problem as the surrounding areas were developed. Approximately 127 acres of Clam Bayou are publicly owned and a restoration project in 2010-2011 sought to improve water quality outflows to Boca Ciega Bay. Clam Bayou Nature preserve is located at 34th Ave. S. & 40th St. S. in St. Petersburg, or south of 29th Avenue South on Miriam Street in Gulfport. It includes habitat for fiddler crabs, clams, wading birds, dolphins, and manatees. Observation decks provide a view over the brackish water estuary and there are trails. Nearby, the city of Gulfport operates a full-service marina.\n\n  Boca Ciega Bay is a body of water connected to the Gulf of Mexico on the west-central coast of Florida. It is bordered by Gulfport, Florida, St. Petersburg, and other municipalities in Pinellas County. Clam Bayou estuary feeds into the bay. Boca Ciega Bay is an aquatic preserve designated in 1968 to halt dredging-and-filling work done in the 1950s. There are mangrove islands as well as miles of canals bounded by seawalls. Along with the Pinellas County Aquatic Preserve, Boca Ciega Bay provides sandy beaches, mangrove shoreline and submerged habitats such as oyster bars, seagrass beds, coral habitat, and spring-fed caves. The 185-acre Boca Ciega Millennium Park in Seminole, Florida, is a protected natural area and preserve. The park features a 35-foot wooden observation tower with a panoramic view of Boca Ciega Bay. The park is a stop on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's \"Great Florida Birding Trail.\"\n\n The Eighteen Mile Swamp is home to many endangered, rare species, including the vulnerable Cryptocarya foetida whose habitat is the notophyll vine forest found at the foot and lower slope of parabolic high dunes on the west of the wetland. These high dunes on the west of Eighteen mile swamp provide excellent examples of long parabolic dunes migrating across North Stradbroke island from the south-east to the north-west. This migration has buried earlier positions of the west coast escarpment to form complex hydrological systems with the ancient dunes (estimated at up to 300,000 years old). No comparative examples of the phenomenon are seen on Moreton and Fraser Islands.\n\nLake Maggiore - The lake has a view of downtown St. Petersburg and connects approximately 380 acres together. This is a home and food source to local wildlife and migrating birds. ; Swamp - Connected to Lake Maggiore. The swamp is surrounded by tall bald cypress, red maple trees, giant leather leaf ferns, and lizard's tail. ; Pine Flatwoods - The plants and animals in this ecosystem have adapted themselves to be fire dependent. Some plant adaptations include long root systems, flaky bark, and wax covered leaves. ; Sand Scrub - Sand Scrub has about 2% of its original habitat remaining. In Florida, it is known as one of the most endangered habitats. Rare, sensitive plants grow here. ; Hammock - The Hammock is a wooded habitat that is slightly higher than the rest of the preserve's ecosystem. It has a dense canopy, created by Live Oak, Sabal Palm, and other trees. \n\n  The Barley Barber Swamp, once a vast Bald Cypress forest and waterway in the Greater Everglades watershed, is a 450 acre parcel of land surrounded by Florida Power & Light's (FPL) Martin County power plant. The swamp is located just over a mile east of Lake Okeechobee and due west of Indiantown, Florida. The old-growth cypress swamp is named after Barley Barber, a man who lived in the area at the turn of the 20th century. Little is known of the man Barley Barber except that he left the region after he had \"trouble with the law.\"\n\nQuestion: What body of water includes the terrain feature where Coffee Swamp is located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1895 to 1901, Mach held a newly created chair for \"the history and philosophy of the inductive sciences\" at the University of Vienna. In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic philosophy of science that became influential in the 19th and \n\nSome of the influential figures in Hans Goldmann's life who impacted his work in ophthalmology were A. Cermak von Seysenegg, Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Konrad Lorenz, Karl Popper, Moritz Schlick, and Ewald Hering. Goldmann worked as a teaching assistant under A. Cermak von Seysenegg, Chairman of the Institute of Physiology of the German Charles University in Prague, where he was initially exposed to influential figures in various fields. During his time at the University of Prague, Goldmann had the opportunity to interact and learn from prominent individuals such as Einstein (physicist), Mach (physicist and psychophysicist), Lorenz (behavioral scientist), Popper (philosopher), Schlick (physicist and philosopher), and Hering (physiologist).\n\nThese influential figures played a role in shaping Goldmann's intellectual pursuits and provided him with a diverse range of knowledge from multiple fields. Goldmann's exceptional intellect allowed him to absorb the essence of these disciplines, which he later applied in his research work in ophthalmology. His work on perimetry and glaucoma, in particular, gained significant recognition and he developed high-precision diagnostic instruments that are still used by ophthalmologists today. Goldmann's ability to combine different areas of study and apply them to ophthalmology made him one of the great pioneers in the field.\n\n George Berkeley suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity, an example later raised by Albert Einstein in his development of general relativity. A more recent form of these objections was made by Ernst Mach. Mach's principle proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, mass is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, \n\n on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008). A related question, raised by Ernst Mach, was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term Mach's principle for this question. \"It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act \n\n Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach was born in Chrlice (Chirlitz), Moravia (then in the Austrian Empire, now part of Brno in the Czech Republic).

The name is also a pun in two languages: the word for \"five\" in Japanese is \"go\". However, the \"go\" used for the car's name is a suffix attached to the names of ships, etc. Thus, the car is known in the Japanese version as simply the \"Mach\".

During that period, Mach continued his work in psycho-physics and in sensory perception. In 1867, he took the chair of experimental physics at the Charles-Ferdinand University, where he stayed for 28 years before returning to Vienna. Mach's main contribution to physics involved his description and photographs of spark shock-waves and then ballistic shock-waves. He described how when a bullet or shell moved faster than the speed of sound, it created a compression \n\n Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach (18 February 1838 – 19 February 1916) was an Austrian (Moravian born) physicist and philosopher, noted for his contributions to physics such as the study of shock waves. The ratio of one's speed to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honour. As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism. Through his criticism of Newton's theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n The Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics (German: Fraunhofer-Institut für Kurzzeitdynamik), commonly known as the Ernst Mach Institute and also by the abbreviation Fraunhofer EMI, is a facility of the Fraunhofer Society in Germany. The Institute is based in Freiburg im Breisgau. Its activities are applied research and development in the fields of materials science and high-speed measurement techniques. The Institute also has offices in Efringen-Kirchen and Kandern. The name \"Ernst Mach Institute\" is named for the physicist Ernst Mach (1838–1916), who first used high-speed photography to visualize ballistic and gas-dynamic processes.\n\nQuestion: Who is the employer of the physicist who Mach number is named after?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These illusions cannot be perceived with halfwave textures. The fullwave stimuli used in experiments, such as random textures and Mexican hats, have uniform expected luminance throughout but exhibit ramp contrast modulations that are exposed through fullwave rectification (e.g. absolute value or square) or by halfwave rectification. The stimuli are presented dynamically, with a new instantiation of the texture every 67 milliseconds, enhancing the magnitude of the illusion. The perceived contrast bands in fullwave Mach stimuli and the brightness bands in a conventional luminance Mach-band stimulus have approximately the same magnitude. Similar magnitudes are also found in Chevreul illusions and Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet illusions when comparing luminance and fullwave patterns. These findings show that second-order illusions are perceived through fullwave, not halfwave, rectification and involve spatial interactions similar to those in first-order processing (luminance).\n\n air in front of it. Using schlieren photography, he and his son Ludwig photographed the shadows of the invisible shock waves. During the early 1890s Ludwig invented an interferometer that allowed for much clearer photographs. But Mach also made many contributions to psychology and physiology, including his anticipation of gestalt phenomena, his discovery of the oblique effect and of Mach bands, an inhibition-influenced type of visual illusion, and especially his discovery of a non-acoustic function of the inner ear that helps control human balance. One of the best-known of Mach's ideas is the so-called \"Mach principle\", concerning the physical origin of inertia. This was never written down by Mach, but was given a graphic \n\nThe Mach Band is actually not related to dentistry or unaffected teeth. It is an optical illusion that occurs due to the way our visual system processes contrast and brightness. When we observe a sharp boundary between two adjacent areas with different brightness levels, our visual perception exaggerates the contrast at that boundary, creating an illusion of a band or strip of higher intensity. This phenomenon was first described by the physicist Ernst Mach in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Mach Band illusion is most commonly observed when there is a gradual change in brightness across a visual stimulus. For example, when a dark area transitions into a lighter area, our visual system enhances the perception of the boundary between these regions, making the dark side appear even darker and the light side appear even lighter. The result is the appearance of a \"band\" of increased intensity, where the boundary between the two regions seems more pronounced than it actually is.\n\nThis illusion is believed to be caused by lateral inhibition, which is a process in the visual system where neurons that detect light in a particular area inhibit the activity of neighboring neurons. This inhibition enhances the perception of contrast and sharpens the edges between different areas of brightness or color.\n\nThe Mach Band illusion has important implications in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and vision science. By studying this visual phenomenon, researchers can gain insights into the complex processes involved in our perception of contrast and brightness.\n\nIn summary, the Mach Band is an optical illusion that occurs due to the exaggeration of contrast at the boundary between two adjacent areas with different brightness levels. It is not related to dentistry or unaffected teeth, but rather a fascinating phenomenon in visual perception.\n\n  In the area of sensory perception, psychologists remember Mach for the optical illusion called Mach bands. The effect exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray as soon as they touch, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system. More clearly than anyone before or since, Mach made the distinction between what he called physiological (specifically visual) and geometrical spaces. Mach's views on mediating structures inspired B. F. Skinner's strongly inductive position, which paralleled Mach's in the field of psychology.\n\nQuestion: Which university employed the person that Mach bands are named after?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Called \"Royal City of Our Lady of the Snows\", in honor of the saint of the day it was founded, its first structures were on the banks of the Sanhauá River, a tributary of the Paraíba River, now known as Porto do Varadouro, in the neighborhood of the same name. In 1588, the city was renamed \"Philipeia of Our Lady of the Snows\", in honor of King Philip II, who at the time accumulated the thrones of Spain and Portugal. In 1634, attracted by the sugar wealth of the then-capital of the Paraíba, the Dutch invaded and named it Fredrikstad (Frederick City), in honor of the prince of Orange, Frederick of Orange. After the decline of New Holland and with the departure of the Dutch, the city was again dominated by the Portuguese and acquired the name \"Parahyba do Norte\" in 1654. The city was renamed João Pessoa in September 1930 in memory of the former governor of Paraíba, João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, who had been murdered on 26 July that year.

He was shot down while giving a speech in front of the University' Main building on February 16, 1971 – one of several students gunned down during the events of the First Quarter Storm, but the first from the city of Davao. As such, he is considered Davao City's first martyr in the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship. Ang Sinco's assassination came after three months during which the students of UM had been on strike. With tensions already running high, Ang Sinco's assassination triggered three days and three nights of riots in Davao's CM and Recto and Oyanguren streets, in what has come to be referred to as the \"Battle of C.M. Recto.\" On November 30, 2018, Ang Sinco's name was engraved on the Wall of Remembrance of the Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes that fought against the Martial Law regime of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\n The son of Martial Law era activist and later University of the Philippines President Francisco Nemenzo Jr, he has himself had a long history of political activism. A UP student leader during the time of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, he was shot in the back during the infamous Welcome Rotonda rally shootings of September 27, 1984 and almost died from the single M-16 bullet that pierced through his body.

It comes as no surprise, then, that in the 1960s and 1970s, the university played an active role in conducting demonstrations, marches, and rallies to raise awareness of sectoral struggles and to campaign against the Marcos dictatorship and land reform policy, among others. Some of the clear examples of the school's activism include the ratifying of the Diliman Declaration on March 1969. Student activists from the university stirred up the masses of youth and the working class to conduct protest actions, from the March 1961 demonstration of 5,000 UP student demonstrators that scuttled the anti-communist witch-hunt of the Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities (CAFA) to the 1970 First Quarter Storm that rocked the National Capital Region with almost weekly marches and rallies of 50,000 to 100,000 people campaigning against the administration. Among the youth organizations that were active include Student Christian Movement of the Philippines, College Editors Guild of the Philippines, League of Filipino Students, and NUSP.\n\n As rinderpest ravaged the country at the turn of the century, the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines decided to establish a College of Veterinary Science. The College was founded on 18 June 1908 through Republic Act No. 1870 by the Philippine Legislature. It was one of the original colleges of the University of the Philippines and was later renamed College of Veterinary Medicine. With Dr. Archibald Ward as the first dean, the College held its first classes on 4 June 1910 with four students at the Animal Quarantine Station, Pandacan, Manila. The first batch of students graduated in the former four-year DVM program in 1914. The college has been relocated to five different places: San Lazaro, Manila (1912–1919); Los Baños, Laguna (1919–1933); back to Pandacan, Manila (1933–1949); Diliman, Quezon City (1949–1983) and finally to Los Baños, Laguna in 1983. In 1976 the World Bank encouraged the Board of Regents to completely transfer the College from UP Diliman to UPLB.

Shortly after Li Chongzhao's birth, Li Zhe's father and mother Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu created Li Chongzhao the unprecedented title of Deputy Crown Prince (皇太孫, Huang Taisun) and gave him a staff. When Emperor Gaozong became ill at the eastern capital Luoyang late in 683, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang and left the capital Chang'an, where Li Zhe was previously in charge, nominally under Li Chongzhao, but with the chancellor Liu Rengui actually in charge. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong died, and Li Zhe succeeded \n\n Liu Congyi was born in 742, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He came from a line of officials of Tang Dynasty, starting with his great-great-grandfather Liu Linfu (劉林甫). His great-granduncle Liu Xiangdao served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, and Liu Xiangdao's son Liu Jingxian served as a chancellor late in the reign of Emperor Gaozong as well as the regency of Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) over their sons Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong. Liu Congyi's grandfather Liu Lingzhi (劉令植) served as a deputy minister, while his father Liu Ruzhi (劉孺之) served as the deputy mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆), which included the Tang capital Chang'an.\n\n mother Consort Liu was of low birth, be created crown prince, so that Li Zhong would be grateful to her. Empress Wang did so, and Emperor Gaozong agreed, after Liu Shi lobbied his fellow chancellors, including Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji. Later in 652, Emperor Gaozong created Li Zhong crown prince. By 654, however, Emperor Gaozong's favors for Empress Wang had waned, particularly in light of his increasing favor for his concubine Consort Wu. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Empress Wang was not good at earning the loyalty of the other concubines and the ladies in waiting, while \n\n Empress Wei, who then installed his son, Li Chongmao, as Emperor Shang. Empress Wei, who had failed to install her daughter Li Guo'er, the Princess Anle, as heir to Emperor Zhongzong, thought that Li Chongmao, born of Zhongzong and a concubine and who was only 16 years old, would be easy to control and allow her to preserve her power. The scheme failed, however, when Princess Taiping, the sister of Emperor Zhongzong, launched a coup two weeks later with her nephew Li Longji (later Emperor Xuanzong), son of the abdicated Emperor Ruizong, and overthrew Empress Wei and the young emperor. Emperor Ruizong, the father of Li Longji and the older brother of Princess Taiping, was restored as emperor.\n\n The future Empress Zhang's family was originally from Deng Prefecture (鄧州, roughly modern Nanyang, Henan). Her grandmother Lady Dou was a younger sister of Consort Dou, a concubine of Emperor Ruizong, whose son Li Longji later became emperor (as Emperor Xuanzong). Consort Dou was put to death by Emperor Ruizong's mother Wu Zetian in 693, while Li Longji was just eight. Lady Dou spent much time raising Li Longji, and later, after Emperor Ruizong returned to the throne in 710, he created Lady Dou the Lady of Deng and honored her greatly. Her sons Zhang Quhuo (張去惑), Zhang Quyí (張去疑), Zhang Qushe (張去奢), Zhang Quyì (張去逸, note different tone than his brother), and Zhang Quying (張去盈) all became key officials, and Zhang Quyì would become the father of the future Empress Zhang.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of Empress Wang's husband?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The members include Lorraine Garland (violin and vocals), Trevor Hartman (drums, accordion, and vocals), and Paul Score (guitar and vocals). The band formed in the summer of 2002 when guitarist Paul Score and Trevor Hartman began playing tunes from Garland's old band, The Flash Girls. \"Before Long,\" explained Score in one interview, \"Lorraine was telling us how to play them correctly, and it went to the wee hours of the morning, and we just had a blast\". The group has two albums, Buried Things, featuring new songs written by Neil Gaiman and Jane Yolen (among others), along with a selection of traditional songs. The second, Get Y'er Hands Off 'Me Booty!, is a live album of (mostly) traditional songs.

The album was originally mixed by Grammy Award-winning soul music engineer Russell Elevado, but Capitol Records were unhappy with releasing it, instead opting for a more polished, synthpop-influenced mix by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran. The original mix of the album was later released as The Dandy Warhols Are Sound in 2009. The album's lead single \"We Used to Be Friends\" was the theme song to the popular TV series Veronica Mars as well as its subsequent film adaptation. Two further singles were released from the album: \"You Were the Last High\" and \"Plan A\".\n\n The Amplifetes is a 4-piece band from Sweden.

According to Taylor-Taylor, it took the band a long time to get noticed by major labels, due to the prevalence of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest. In a June 1997 interview with Billboard, he remarked, \"When we came up, there were a group of bands that didn't get recognition because people weren't appreciating what it was we were doing.

In 1945, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator. They reported that it would work. That they had reached this conclusion put Enrico Fermi's concerns about the viability of the design to rest. The initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.\n\n At Princeton, Wilson eventually took over Smyth's project the development of an alternative approach to electromagnetic separation from Lawrence's calutron method, used for the purpose of separating the fissile uranium-235 isotope of uranium from the much more common uranium-238, which is a key step to producing an atomic bomb. By 1941 the project had produced a device called the \"isotron,\" which, unlike the calutron, used an electrical field to separate the uranium instead of a magnetic one.

Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb, an investment of $2 billion, temporary use of 13,000 tons of silver, and 24,000 skilled workers drove the research and development phase of the project.

Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon that used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The other, known as a Fat Man device, was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington.

The district's 9-term incumbent, fellow Democrat Bud Cramer, was not running for reelection. He won the June 2008 Democratic primary election with 90% of the vote, defeating physicist David Maker. Cramer had endorsed Griffith in the primary.\n\nGriffith faced Republican Wayne Parker, an insurance agent from Huntsville, in the November election. Parker had sought this seat unsuccessfully twice before, in 1994 and 1996, losing both times to Bud Cramer.\n\nThe 5th was considered one of the few realistic chances for a Republican pickup in what was forecast to be a very bleak year for Republicans because of the district's and state's recent voting history.  While Democrats still held most local offices as well as most state legislative seats in the area, the district's residents had become increasingly willing to support Republicans at the national and state level. It last supported a Democrat for president in 1984, and George W. Bush and John McCain won the district by wide double-digit margins in 2000, 2004 and, ultimately, 2008.\n\nDue to these trends, most forecasters rated the district as a toss-up. CQ Politics forecast the race as 'No Clear Favorite', The Cook Political Report ranked it 'Democratic Toss-Up', and The Rothenberg Political Report rated it 'Pure Toss-Up'.\n\nGriffith prevailed by taking 52 percent of the vote to Parker's 48 percent. He carried all but one of the district's seven counties. This came even as McCain (who carried the 5th with 61 percent of the vote) and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions (whose seat was up for re-election) won every county in the district.  His victory, and that of Bobby Bright in the 2nd District, gave Alabama two white Democratic congressmen for the first time since Glen Browder and Tom Bevill left the House in 1997.\n\n2010\n\nGriffith ran for re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in 2010, but was defeated in the June 1 Republican primary by Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks. Brooks received 51% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run-off. Griffith received 33%. Conservative activist Les Phillip received 16%.\n\n2012\n\nIn January 2012, he filed for a rematch against Brooks in the Republican primary. He said of the incumbent, \"We'll contrast my time in Congress with my opponent's time in Congress. The distinction is clear, he has wandered away from many of the issues people want us to address.\" Brooks defeated him in the rematch 71%–29%, a landslide margin of 42 points. He won all five of the counties.\n\n2014\n\nSupporters of Griffith circulated petitions to place him on the November ballot as an Independent. Griffith considered running but decided against it.\n\nTenure\nGriffith has stated that he leans conservative on a variety of issues, though not all. He states he is a fiscal conservative who has called repeatedly for reducing the national debt. He is a strong supporter of NASA and America's dominance in space.\n\nGriffith voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act, cap-and-trade legislation and the 2009 economic stimulus act.\n\nParty switch\nGriffith was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but on December 22, 2009, he announced he would become a Republican. He cited the health care bill as a major reason for his switch, and he had also clashed with the Democrats over fiscal and foreign policy. During his announcement, he stated:\n\nI believe our nation is at a crossroads and I can no longer align myself with a party that continues to pursue legislation that is bad for our country, hurts our economy, and drives us further and further into debt.\n\nThe GOP had been courting Griffith since August, when he publicly criticized the Democratic House leadership in the wake of raucous town hall meetings in his district, stating that he wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker as she is \"divisive and polarizing\". He also opposed the White House's decision to cancel a missile defense shield in Europe, which could have contributed to Huntsville's defense industry. His switch is the first time a member of Congress switched from the majority party to the minority party since New York Representative Michael Forbes' switch from Republican to Democrat in 1999. Forbes also lost his primary campaign following his switch. The 5th was one of the few districts in the former Confederacy that, at the time, had not elected a Republican since Reconstruction.\n\nIn January 2010, rebelling against his party switch, Griffith's congressional staff resigned en masse, including his chief of staff, legislative director, press secretary, and his intern. Shortly after switching parties, Griffith joined the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans.\n\nGriffith's voting record veered sharply to the right after his switch.  He'd garnered a 56 from the American Conservative Union in 2009, but in 2010 garnered a 95.\n\nUpon Griffith's party switch, he became the first Republican to represent Alabama's 5th district since John Benton Callis, who was elected to a single term (1868-1870) during Reconstruction.\n\nCommittee assignments\n Committee on Energy and Commerce\n Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet\n Subcommittee on Energy and Environment\n Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n\nCaucus memberships\n Missile Defense (co-chair)\n Modeling and Simulation\n NASA House Action Committee\n\n2014 gubernatorial election\n\nGriffith ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election.

He returned to the Democratic Party in 2014 and unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election.\n\nEarly life, education, and medical career\nGriffith was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He taught 7th-grade arithmetic for less than a year at T.H. Harris Junior High School (later Middle School) in Metairie in Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans prior to being admitted to medical school. He received his medical degree from the Louisiana State University Medical School in 1970 and served in residency at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. After serving at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans and a year of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas, Griffith began preparing to become a radiation oncologist, one who specializes in using radiation to cure cancer, training in radiation oncology through a combined program between UTMB and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He served as a Medical Corps captain in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1970 to 1973, while continuing his medical training at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans.\n\nGriffith was recruited on a \"cold call\" to Alabama and established the Huntsville Cancer Treatment Center. As a physician, he provided discounted care to patients who lacked insurance. Griffith also conducted several clinical trials in conjunction with the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He retired from medicine in December 1992, though he still holds a license to practice in both Alabama and Texas.\n\nEarly political career\nGriffith unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Huntsville against the three-term incumbent,  Loretta Spencer in 2004.

Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.

While in federal prison, he was nominated for president by the Socialist Party of America in the 1920 Election for the fifth and final time despite his disfranchisement. He received 919,799 votes (3.4% of the popular vote), the most ever for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. It was slightly more than his 900,672 total in the 1912 election, which had equaled six percent of the popular vote. (National women's suffrage in 1920 greatly increased the total number of votes cast.) In 1921, Congress largely repealed the Espionage and Sedition Acts. On December 23, 1921 President Warren G. Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served, effective Christmas Day. He did not issue a pardon.

The first SP nominee for President was labor leader Eugene V. Debs and he received votes in North Carolina several times. The first time was in 1904, when he received 125 votes. In 1912, the party held its convention with 100 delegates from 12 counties in Winston-Salem. A theme of the meeting was opposition to global war. In that year, Socialist nominee Debs received 1,025 votes. In 1916, Socialist nominee Allen Benson received 509 votes for president. In 1920, Debs was once again the nominee and earned 446 votes while in federal prison. The vote totals were relatively low because small parties were required to print and pay for the ballots with the names of their party's nominees. The party's 1920 platform included calls for the repeal of poll taxes and the guaranteeing of voting rights regardless skin color, which did not come to fruition until the Civil Rights Movement decades later.\n\n Along with Elliott, who ran for Congress in 1900, Debs was the first federal office candidate for the fledgling socialist party, running unsuccessfully for president the same year.

The range runs north to south, bordered on the east by the Kettle River and the Columbia River, and on the west by the Kettle River, the Curlew Valley and the San Poil River. The mountainous region begins immediately north of the Canada–US border, at Grand Forks, British Columbia, extending 110 miles (177 km) south to the bend of the Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt, formed by Grand Coulee Dam, where it terminates. The Okanogan Highlands are adjacent to the range on the west, and the Selkirk Mountains are adjacent on the east. The Sherman Pass Scenic Byway runs 40 mi east from the town of Republic, Washington across the center of the Kettle River Range and reaches its highest point at Sherman Pass, 5575 ft, the highest mountain pass open all year in Washington state. The route is named for American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, who crossed the range in 1883.\n\n Columbia Generating Station is a BWR-5. It features a Mark II containment structure. The reactor core holds up to 764 fuel assemblies, and 185 control rods, more technically known as control blades. The reactor is licensed for a power output of 3486 thermal megawatts (MWt). The gross electrical output of the plant is 1230 megawatts-electric (MWe). The Columbia Generating Station features six low-profile fan-driven cooling towers. Each tower cascades clean warmed water, a byproduct of water heat exchanging with steam after leaving a turbine, down itself and subsequently cools the warmed water via a combination of evaporation and heat exchange with the surrounding air. Some water droplets fall back to earth in the process, thereby creating a hoar frost in the winter. At times, the vapor cloud from the cooling towers can reach 10000 ft in height and can be seen at a great distance. Replacement water for the evaporated water is drawn from the nearby Columbia River.\n\n Located on the Northeast River. Two vertical francis turbine units, shaft direct connected to the generators, with individual direct connected exciters, 49.5 m static head, 514 rpm, 1.42 MW, for a total of 3.73 MW. Two generators, 1,600 kVA each, 13,200 volts, 3 phase, 60 Hz. The original penstocks were built out of wood, using tongue & groove staves held together with metal bands (the same technology used in wood barrels), 1.82 m diameter, 965.6 m long, later replaced in part with fibreglass penstocks. More recently (2010) the penstocks from Coon Pond to the Mill Lake Station were replaced with black polypropylene, buried underground.\n\n The Kettle River once supported salmon and other anadromous fish. The construction of Grand Coulee Dam, along with Chief Joseph Dam, blocked fish migration up the Columbia and its upper tributaries, including the Kettle River. In addition, Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, Lake Roosevelt, flooded traditional fishery sites, including Kettle Falls near the mouth of the Kettle River.\n\n From its source at the outlet of Holmes Lake in the Monashee Mountains of British Columbia, the Kettle River flows south to Midway, British Columbia. Along the way it is joined by many tributaries, most notably the West Kettle River. Below Midway, the river loops south, crossing the Canada–US border into the United States, through Ferry County, Washington, before flowing north back into Canada, passing by Grand Forks, British Columbia, where the Granby River joins. After flowing east for about 10 mi, the river turns south again, just south of Christina Lake, entering the United States again. It then flows south, forming part of the Ferry-Stevens County line, before joining the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, Washington. The Columbia River at this point is a large reservoir impounded behind Grand Coulee Dam, called Lake Roosevelt. The Kettle enters the lake at the Columbia's river mile 706. The Kettle River is undammed, making it one of the extremely few rivers with constant flow in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nQuestion: What is the river that the Kettle Generating Station is located on a tributary of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, also known as Miller Steam Plant or Plant Miller, is a coal-fired electrical generation facility sitting on approximately 800 acres in West Jefferson, Alabama. The plant has four units, the first of which opened in 1978. Additional units commenced operation in 1985, 1989, and 1991, respectively. Each unit has a capacity of 705.5 MWe (660 MWe net). The plant contains two natural draft cooling towers. The James H. Miller Jr. Plant was cited by The Weather Channel and the Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 as the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the United States.\n\n After many of the Trent Valley power stations closed the epithet Megawatt Valley began to be used for a section of Yorkshire between Leeds, York and Doncaster. This was due to the presence of Ferrybridge C (1966–2016), Eggborough (1967–2018) and Drax (1974–) coal-fired power stations. This was one of the few remaining concentrations of coal-fired generation in the UK; the power stations being located close to historic coal-mining sites on the South Yorkshire Coalfield and to the River Aire. Drax is a large power station capable of generating 7% of UK electricity demand and, despite being the UK's cleanest and most-efficient coal-fired power station is Europe's biggest single source of carbon dioxide emissions. The term Megawatt Valley, in relation to the Yorkshire power stations, has been mentioned (\"What ever happened to The Megawatt Valley? It pumped out the sounds to the avenues and alleys\") in the song Two Lane Texaco by the folk band My Darling Clementine. The term has also been used in reference to a location in West Virginia, United States, where five plants are located, totalling some 6000 megawatts of generating capacity. This includes the Mountaineer Power Plant, in Mason County and four nearby plants.\n\n  The South Platte River is one of the two principal tributaries of the Platte River. Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. It joins the North Platte River in western Nebraska to form the Platte, which then flows across Nebraska to the Missouri. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. In its valley along the foothills in Colorado, it has permitted agriculture in an area of the Colorado Piedmont and Great Plains that is otherwise arid.\n\n The Churchill Falls Generating Station is a hydroelectric underground power station in Labrador. At 5,428 MW, it is the tenth largest in the world, and the second-largest in Canada, after the Robert-Bourassa generating station in northwestern Quebec. Rather than a single large dam, the plant's reservoir is contained by 88 dykes, totalling 64 km in length. Now called the Smallwood Reservoir, it has a capacity of 33 cubic kilometres in a catchment area of about 72,000 square kilometres, an area larger than the Republic of Ireland. It drops over 305 metres to the site of the plant's 11 turbines. The \n\n Laramie River Station is a major coal-fired power plant, located in Platte County. It is operated by Basin Electric Power Cooperative and owned jointly by several of its member cooperatives. It is the second largest coal-fired power plant in Wyoming by capacity. The station currently employs 300 workers. Electricity produced at the station is distributed to across Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado. Three similar units (each 570 MWe nameplate capacity) were launched in the early 1980s.\n\nQuestion: What is the river where Long Spruce Generating Station is located a tributary of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Consequently, the footbridge remained intact for 276 years, until washed away again in a flood from typhoon \"Kijia\" in 1950. It was in a weakened state at the time, as the Japanese had stopped maintaining the bridge during World War II, In 1953, the bridge was reconstructed similar to the original, using metal nails made from the same tatara iron used when forging katana to increase its durability. In 1922, the bridge was declared a national treasure. Between 2001 and 2004, all five bridge girders were restored for the first time in 50 years.\n\n 1994. This bridge has a 122 m main span, a 16.2-m deck width and utilises four 10.7-m tall pylons each supporting two sets of eight exposed extradosed tendons in a modified fan arrangement. These tendons pass over saddles at the top of each pylon, however it is unclear as to whether they form a continuous tendon between the two spans, as the designers' documentation refers to them being anchored outside each saddle to restrain slip.

Upper-class white women in particular first articulated their own oppression in marriage and the private sphere using the metaphor of slavery, and they first developed a political consciousness by mobilizing in support of abolitionism. Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Maria Weston Chapman were among the early female abolitionists. The Abolitionist cause provided women who were previously bound to their roles as wives and mothers the opportunity to publicly challenge sexism and learn how to politically engage as activists, though the African American women's suffrage movement was a different vein of women's suffrage, and one could even argue a different movement altogether. Abolitionists who headed the Equal Rights Association like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony had a primarily white agenda. After the Civil War it became clear that black and white women had different views of why the right to vote was essential. Unlike white suffragists, Black women sought the ballot for themselves and their men to empower black communities besieged by the reign of racial terror that erupted after Emancipation in the late 1800s.\n\nQuestion: Who married the publisher of abolitionist newspaper The North Star?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She was the younger daughter of Ferdinand Oden Horstmann (1846–1894) and Harriett Kelley Horstmann. The Horstmann family were wealthy Philadelphia manufacturers and merchants of military garment trimmings (passementerie) and military regalia. Until she married Sidney Small of Toronto November 22, 1905 in Washington, D.C., Ethel Horstmann lived the life of a wealthy socialite in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. attending races, presidential balls and diplomatic receptions. At the time of 1911 census, Ethel and Sidney Small were residing at 70 Walmer Road, Toronto, in the wealthy Annex. Sidney Small was a successful commercial real estate agent with offices on Adelaide Street. Ethel Small's interest in politics may derive from her mother's side of the family. Her maternal grandfather William D.

Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. At 67, she published her widely praised novel Iola Leroy (1892), placing her among the first Black women to publish a novel. As a young woman in 1850, she taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the AME Church.

She joined her father in Boston, working with him for a time as an antislavery lecturer in New England. Concerned that his biography was no longer in print, Josephine published Biography of an American Bondman (1856) to preserve his legacy. Begun while Josephine was at school in France, her biography reworks material from Wells Brown's 1847 autobiography while adding additional detail on abuses he experienced while a slave, and the hostility that mulatto slaves experienced from both blacks and whites. Josephine also describes his travels in Great Britain.\n\n Elizabeth Josephine Brown (June 12, 1839 – January 16, 1874) was the daughter and biographer of escaped African-American slave William Wells Brown and his first wife Elizabeth Schooner. Josephine's account, Biography of an American Bondman, by His Daughter, was published in Boston by R. F. Wallcut in 1856. It was long believed to be the first biography written by an African-American woman, but is now known to have been predated by Susan Paul's Memoir of James Jackson, the attentive and obedient scholar (1835). Biography of an American Bondman draws heavily on and generally parallels William Wells Brown's own account of his life, Narrative of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave (1847). However, Josephine was forthcoming about details of abuse and mistreatment which Wells Brown's account does not include, and openly addressed the problems of mulatto slaves. She also expands the account to include Brown's life in Europe.\n\n The Tylers retired to Sherwood Forest, where they lived tranquilly until the Civil War.

D. McClatchy. Based on the Stephen King 1992 novel Dolores Claiborne, the opera was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera and premiered in San Francisco on September 18, 2013. In 2017, the New York City Opera performed the world premiere of a new chamber version of the opera at the 59E59 Theater A, directed by Michael Capasso. In 2019, it was produced by the Boston University Opera Institute.\n\n The novel was adapted into a 1995 film directed by Taylor Hackford. It starred Kathy Bates as Dolores, with Jennifer Jason Leigh as her daughter Selena, and Judy Parfitt as Vera Donovan. David Joss Buckley adapted the novel for the stage. It was produced in Germany and France and nominated for Globe De Crystal by Paris Premiere, 2007. Dolores Claiborne, the operatic adaptation of the novel composed by Tobias Picker to a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, premiered at San Francisco Opera on September 18, 2013, with Patricia Racette in the title role.\n\n Dolores Claiborne is a 1995 American psychological thriller drama film directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Christopher Plummer, and David Strathairn. It is based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Stephen King. The plot focuses on the strained relationship between a mother and her daughter, largely told through flashbacks, after her daughter arrives to her remote hometown on a Maine island where her mother has been accused of murdering the elderly woman for whom she had long been a care-provider and companion. The film was the second major King film adaptation to star Bates in a leading role after Misery (1990) five years earlier. The screenplay for Dolores Claiborne was adapted by Tony Gilroy, and the film was shot in Nova Scotia in 1994. Dolores Claiborne was well-received by critics, with the performances of Bates and Leigh being especially praised, and grossed over $46 million on a $13 million budget. Kathy Bates stated in a retrospective interview that her performance as the titular Dolores was her favorite performance she had ever given. In 2013, Time named the film among the top 10 greatest Stephen King film adaptations.\n\n The second act opens with Dolores preparing food and liquor for watching the solar eclipse with her husband. When her husband appears she provokes him into a rage, running off into the woods. While in pursuit, Dolores' husband falls into a well she had concealed with branches earlier. Dolores covers the well with planks, leaving her husband inside to die. Back in the present, the interrogation of Dolores continues. She is joined by Selena, her now adult daughter, who tells the police Dolores could not have murdered Vera as the two had become very close after 40 years together. Shortly after it is revealed that Vera left her entire estate to Dolores, though Dolores curses her name in response. Back at her home, Selena asks her mother what really happened to Vera Donovan. The next scene reveals that Vera took her own life, throwing herself down a flight of stairs when Dolores was not looking. In the end, Selena leaves Dolores alone yet again, still having not forgiven her for the murder of her father.\n\n Dolores Claiborne is being interrogated about the recent death of Vera Donovan, a wealthy widow who employed Dolores as a maid for forty years. The police believe Dolores to be Vera's murderer, despite her claims to the contrary. While denying their accusations, she begins to tell the story of her life, her dead husband, and her estranged daughter. A series of flashbacks reveal that when she began working for Vera Donovan, Dolores was the victim of an abusive husband who, as she eventually learns, was also molesting their daughter. Vera and Dolores gradually develop a relationship during her first ten years of service. On the eve of a solar eclipse, Dolores confides in her employer about her husband and his abuse of both her and her daughter. Vera suggests Dolores take advantage of the up-coming eclipse to solve her problem, singing, \"accidents can be an unhappy woman's best friend.\"\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the producer of Dolores Claiborne?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It directly employs 600,000 people and supports around 2–3 million people in related industries. It is politically a very important part of the country's economy: firstly, due to the large number of employed people and secondly, because many citizens depend on the social services provided by automotive companies. For example, the well-being of the giant AvtoVAZ factory in Tolyatti is massively important to the city or to the region of Samara Oblast. Tolyatti is a typical monotown, a city whose economy is dependent on a single company. The factory employed around 100,000 people of the city's population of 700,000 in 2009. In 2009, former President Dmitry Medvedev launched the Medvedev modernisation \n\n Avtotor was founded in 1996 by a group of investors, led by current majority owner and chairman of the board of directors, Vladimir Shcherbakov (former Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR and Chairman of Goskomtrud, the State Committee for Labour and Social Problems in the Soviet Union). With an investment of $130,000,000, an assembly plant was installed in an unoccupied shipyard in Kaliningrad, with an original plan to produce Nissan automobiles. The name of the company is a portmanteau of \"auto\" and the German word \"tor\", meaning \"gate\". In 1997, the new plant also began assembling Kia automobiles. In the aftermath of the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the company found itself in a difficult financial position following a significant drop in automobile sales. To mitigate the consequences of the crisis, the company changed its business model. The company secured a contract with BMW, making it a licensed importer for the German automaker. Later, the company began a partnership with General Motors, starting full-scale assembly on the Chevrolet Lacetti.\n\n The four most popular cars in Russia in 2009 were all AvtoVAZ models. The economy car Lada Priora topped the list with 84,779 sold units. Lada Samara was second with 77,679 units sold in Russia, and the classic Lada 2105/2107 was third with sales of 57,499. Lada 2105 was expected to considerably increase sales following the car scrappage scheme launched in March 2010. The higher-end Lada Kalina was the fourth most sold car in Russia in 2009, selling 52,499 units that year.

Following his graduation from the Moscow Art College and Moscow University of Art In 1992, Alexander subsequently enrolled in the Union of Artists at UNESCO and took part in regular expositions of this Union. In 1993 the Union Gallery exhibitions were shown in several capital towns in Cyprus. As a result of these exhibitions, Alexander’s Moscow collection became influenced with the imagery of the antiquity he observed built by the invading crusaders. His creative work has developed with a sense of theme whilst at the same time echoing symbolic realism and combining an Art Nouveau artistic flavor influenced from his art education \n\n His father, Vasily Dosekin, was an early photographer; known for his portraits of the Imperial Family.

His ancestors had Baltic origins and originated in Lithuania. He struggled to learn in a conventional classroom setting, and he has stated in interviews that he was a poor student, often acting up. Bushkov would never receive an undergraduate degree and was largely self-taught, through his voracious appetite for reading. His personal library has grown to such immense size over the years that he was forced to add a second storey to his dacha in order to accommodate it. Prior to the death in a helicopter crash of the former governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Alexander Lebed in 2002, Bushkov had held office as an advisor and aide to the governor. After 2002, information about Bushkov has become increasingly scarce. The author's website suggests that he is at present living in isolation in a dacha on the distant outskirts of Minusinsk, which lacks modern means of communication, and so, he is essentially a recluse. Bushkov shares his home with several hamsters and a dog.\n\n He was abandoned by his parents and was raised at the Moscow Orphanage.

The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at Ramla, Raqqa, Basra, Kufa, Mosul and Samarra, all of which developed into major cities. Caliph Abd al-Malik established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686. This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the Arabization of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes \n\n By 661 the Umayyads had taken firm control of the new Muslim state, which it ruled from Damascus. The Caliph Mu'awiya could see the foreign lands west of Egypt in terms of the Muslim contest with the Byzantine Empire.\n\n The population of the region did not become predominantly Muslim and Arab in identity until nearly a millennium after the conquest. Following the Muslim conquest, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (602–680 CE) of the Banu Umayya clan governed the Syrian region for twenty years, and developed the province as his family's power base. Relying on Syrian military support, Mu'awiya emerged as the victor in the First Fitna (656–661) and established the Umayyad Caliphate (661). Under the Umayyads, Damascus was the capital of the Caliphate and Syria formed the Caliphate's metropolitan province; likewise, the elite Syrian army, the Ahl al-Sham (أَهْـل الـشَّـام), formed the main pillar of the Umayyad government. Al-Sham became much less important under the Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyads in 750. The Abbasids moved the capital first to Kufa, and then to Baghdad and Samarra, all of which were in \n\n  After the initial period of the four rightly-guided caliphs (632-661) following the death of Muhammad (570-632), the ruling family of the Umayyads took firm control of the new Muslim state. The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750) ruled from the city of Damascus; their first Caliph Mu'awiya (602-680, r.661-680) directed Muslim forces in their on-going military contest with the Byzantine Empire. Decades earlier the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt had fallen to Islamic arms. Under Mu'awiya the Umayyad Caliphate could see how the foreign lands west of Egypt figured in the \"geo-political\" and military strategy of this struggle. Hence there began the decades-long undertaking resulting in the Umayyad conquest of North Africa.\n\n governorship (636–638), and the dīwān of the Caliphate's other garrison centers followed its organization.

To the dīwān al-jund, the first Umayyad caliph, Mu'awiya (r. 661–680), added the bureau of the land tax (dīwān al-kharāj) in Damascus, which became the main dīwān, as well as the bureau of correspondence (dīwān al-rasāʾil), which drafted the caliph's letters and official documents, and the bureau of the seal (dīwān al-khātam), which checked and kept copies of all correspondence before sealing and dispatching it.

The novel's plot revolves around many things, but is essentially about the consequences of turning one's art into a simple commodity; i.e. giving into market forces. The market force within Erasure mirrors the late-90s reality around how the publishing industry pigeon-holed Black writers, and centered or valued certain experiences [those of the urban poor] over others.

On November 13, this group produced a document that won approval. The new government would consist of a chief executive and a General Council who would share powers. Under the assumption that these two branches would have full cooperation, there was no system of checks and balances. Believing there was no time to wait for general elections, the Consultation determined that the governor and lieutenant governor would be chosen by the delegates themselves, a practice somewhat common among states in the United States.

Lamar (the second elected president of the Republic) raised a force of 56 Rangers to fight the Cherokee and the Comanche, partly in retaliation for the support they had given the Mexicans at the Cordova Rebellion against the Republic. Ten Rangers were killed in the Battle of Stone Houses in 1837.

In the next weeks, the council authorized the creation of a new regular army to be commanded by Sam Houston. As Houston worked to establish an army independent from the existing volunteer army, the council repeatedly interfered in military matters. After authorizing an expedition to take Matamoros, Mexico, the council named several men, simultaneously, to organize and lead the assault, angry at the effect the expedition was having on existing Texian garrisons, Smith dissolved the council.

Houston was appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, as he had spent much of his career dealing with Indian nations.

Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could not be forced to accept Houston as their commander.

Novel gameplay mechanics found in M.C. Kids include a spin device that turns the player upside down and reverses gravity, the ability to warp throughout the current level via a zipper, and a boat that can be both ridden and carried.\n\n The game begins with the titular M.C.

Cham said \"She was about 4, which is just at that perfect age where she really does wonder why, all the time. Any answer you give her, she’ll (have) a follow-up question, another why.\" Cham and Whiteson went with animals as the show's characters to make them \"appealing but also relatable at the same time\", and to \"highlight their range of skills and abilities.\"\n\nQuestion: Who developed the eponymous character from the series that contains Mickey's Safari in Letterland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

PBS found Cham's comic, Piled Higher and Deeper, online and asked if he was interested in pitching to them. \"I reached out to Daniel, and what inspires us beyond science is our children,\" Cham recalled. \"They are curious, and it motivated us to create the show.\" Cham cites Pogo and Calvin and Hobbes as inspiration for the show's visual design, which he described as \"something that felt natural and calming, as opposed to overloaded or frenetic.\" The character of Elinor was inspired by Cham's own daughter, Elinor. Cham said \"She was about 4, which is just at that perfect age where she really does wonder why, all the time. Any answer you give her, she’ll (have) a follow-up question, another why.\" Cham and Whiteson went with animals as the show's characters to make them \"appealing but also relatable at the same time\", and to \"highlight their range of skills and abilities.\"\n\nQuestion: Who is the child of the creator of A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cassette copies of the original Classics series became highly sought-after and are very popular with collectors, since most retailers had the first home video release for Disney animated features in their stores until the label was discontinued.

In September 1945 the new communist government made coal the most strategic natural resource to the country, which heavily influenced development of the Upper Silesian region, including Czerwionka-Leszczyny, in the subsequent decades through massive investment into coal mining industry and scaling up productions and employment. In the early 1950s the construction of a large mining estate started in Leszczyny, pulling people from all across Poland to work in coal industry, and in the 1960s similar estates started to pop up \n\n and imprisoned in the Soviet Gulag system.

Curonian was a Baltic language; some scholars consider it to have been an Eastern Baltic, intermediate between Lithuanian and Latvian, while others like Vytautas Mažiulis classify it as Western Baltic. Linguist Eduard Vääri argues that it is possible that Curonians were Baltic Finns. The attested local Finnic language, Livonian, may be the source of Finnic elements in Curonian. In 1912 Latvian linguist Jānis Endzelīns finally proved that Curonian was a Baltic language; according to him, Curonian by its qualities was in between Lithuanian and Latvian languages.

With the passage of the initiative and a lack of confidence from federal and state agencies, the LACMTA brought in Julian Burke, a turn-around expert from the private sector. His goal was to revive MTA's reputation and stabilize its precarious budgetary condition. He recommended suspension of construction on both the Pasadena Blue Line light rail line to Pasadena and an extension of the \n\n Measure R, a proposal that enacted a 1/2 cent increase in sales tax to fund transportation throughout Los Angeles County, including rail, subway and freeway improvements, was approved by voters in November 2008. In September 2005, Metro broke ground on a 6 mi extension of the Gold Line from Union Station, which now runs through Little Tokyo to the corner of Pomona and Atlantic Boulevards in East L.A.. The Eastside Gold Line Extension light rail extension replaces a once-planned Red Line subway extension. It travels mostly at grade, but has two underground stations. The extension began operation on November 15, 2009 and provides service to some of the city's most historically underserved neighborhoods. The first passengers boarded the train at 3:40 a.m. and an estimated 50,000 people took part in \"a festive day of celebration and free rides.\" The Metro Silver Line, a reconfiguration of existing service on the Harbor and El Monte Transitways, opened on December 13, 2009.\n\n The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the government agency responsible for regional transportation planning and financing in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was created in 1970 by the State of California, with support from the Bay Area Council, to coordinate transportation services in the Bay Area's nine counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. The MTC is fourth most populous metropolitan planning organization in the United States.\n\n The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) operates six rail lines as part of its Metro Rail system. This system includes 4 light rail lines and 2 heavy rail lines. The agency owns, operates and maintains a fleet of over 450 rail vehicles to operate these services.\n\n This article discusses the history of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA, also known as \"Metro\"), the regional transportation planning agency for Los Angeles County, California.\n\nQuestion: According to the agency that considers if Los Angeles County is to be a separate metropolitan area, what is the total area in square miles?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This is similar to the grade crossing identifier number database compiled by the Federal Railroad Administration which identifies all railroad crossings. This bridge information includes the design of the bridge and the dimensions of the usable portion. The data is often used to analyze bridges and judge their conditions. The inventory is developed with the purpose of having a unified database for bridges to ensure the safety of the traveling public as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. It includes identification information, bridge types and specifications, operational conditions, bridge data including geometric data and functional description, and inspection data. Any bridge more than 20 feet (6 meters) long used for vehicular traffic is included.\n\n A GIS is a system that incorporates software, hardware, and data for collecting, managing, analyzing, and portraying geographically referenced information.

They provide comprehensive information on employment flows for workers (accession and separations), jobs (creations and destructions), and earnings for various demographic subgroups (age and gender), economic industry (NAICS industry groups), detailed geography (block, county, Core-Based Statistical Area, and Workforce Investment Area), and ownership (private, all). Unlike other local labor market series in the U.S. or the rest of the world, the QWI includes fully interacted publication tables, making it a unique and valuable resource.\n\nThe QWI data cover 47 states, representing around 98% of the private workforce in those states and approximately 92% of all private employment in the entire economy. This extensive state participation allows for the generation of national estimates constructed from these data. The QWI focuses on worker, job, and excess (churning) reallocation rates, rather than levels of the basic variables. This allows for meaningful comparisons with existing labor market series from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and the Business Employment Dynamics Series, both produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nWhat sets the QWI apart is its inclusion of demographic and industry detail for both worker and job flow data. These details are compiled from underlying micro-data that have been integrated at the job and establishment levels by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program at the Census Bureau. By providing a granular view of labor market dynamics, the QWI enhances the existing series by offering comprehensive insights into factors such as worker and job flows across different demographic groups, industries, and geographic areas.\n\nIt is important to note that the estimates presented in the QWI are compiled exclusively from public-use data series and are available for download. This accessibility ensures that researchers, policymakers, and other interested individuals can utilize the QWI to gain valuable insights into labor market trends and dynamics.\n\nOverall, the Quarterly Workforce Indicators offer a robust and detailed perspective on employment, job flows, and earnings in the United States, and their inclusion of demographic and industry detail sets them apart from other labor market series produced by different organizations.\n\n The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), who has overall responsibility for GEOINT in the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), defines GEOINT as \"information about any object—natural or man-made—that can be observed or referenced to the Earth, and has national security implications.\" Some of the sources of collected imagery information for GEOINT are imagery satellites, cameras on airplanes, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and drones, handheld cameras, maps, or GPS coordinates. Recently the NGA and IC have increased the use of commercial satellite imagery for intelligence support, such as the use of the IKONOS, Landsat, or SPOT satellites. These sources produce digital imagery via electro-optical systems, radar, infrared, visible \n\n A GIS is a system that incorporates software, hardware, and data for collecting, managing, analyzing, and portraying geographically referenced information.

Since the NGA is a U.S. Department of Defense combat support agency and a member of the IC, it uses GIS to produce precise, up-to-date GEOINT for members of the U.S. Armed Forces, the IC, and other government agencies. Web-enabled GIS applications allow for fast, efficient sharing and disseminating of geospatial data, products, and intelligence from the NGA to its allies, warfighters, partners, and other agencies across the World Wide Web. The NGA and Esri have successfully collaborated on providing timely, accurate, and relevant GEOINT in support of U.S. national security for the past 20 years. The NGA has created a grouping \n\n U.S. Geological Survey and oversaw the creation of the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database system. Census officials were able to evaluate the more sophisticated and detailed results that the TIGER system produced; furthermore, TIGER data is also available to the public. And while the TIGER system does not directly amass demographic data, as a geographic information system (GIS), it can be used to merge demographics to conduct more accurate geospatial and mapping analysis. In July 2019 the Census Bureau deprecated American FactFinder, which was decommissioned in March 2020 after 20 years of being the agency's primary tool for data dissemination.

The company stages seven productions each year as well as the Arkansas New Play Festival of emerging works, totaling 270 annual performances for an audience of approximately 60,000 including 20,000 students and their teachers. The company is one of only two companies in the state of Arkansas presenting a year-round season and affiliated with the national professional actors' union, Actors' Equity Association. TheatreSquared is co-led by artistic director Robert Ford and executive director Martin Miller. In addition to its season of theatrical works, the company's educational outreach program offers an educational school tour to more than 80 high schools, the Word/Play in-school literacy intervention program, a professional development institute for educators, and student matinees and discussions. In 2011, TheatreSquared was awarded a National Theatre Company Grant from the American Theatre Wing, recognizing the company as one of the nation's ten most promising emerging professional theatres. They were also featured in the American Theatre Wing's Working in the Theatre series on Theatre in Arkansas in 2016.\n\n LAByrinth Theater Company was founded in 1992 by 13 actors looking for \"a home where the group, for three hours each week, could engage in a variety of theatrical exercises designed to push each others’ limits and bind together into a tightly knit, uninhibited and impassioned ensemble – one in which each member is given the opportunity and support not only to act, but to write, direct, produce, sweep, paint, hang lights, etcetera.\" This expansion of artists into the exploration of new aspects of theater remains one of the primary goals of Labyrinth, and the company is fostering a new generation of writers and directors who come from acting backgrounds. In 2017, Dane Laffrey, Scott Zielinski, and Michael Urie won Obie Awards presented by the American Theatre Wing.\n\n On August 1, 1953, six actors, two children, a dog and two pigs moved into a historic ruin called Hanover Tavern. The transplanted New Yorkers founded Central Virginia's first professional theatre, and named the company in memory of a deceased college friend, Barbara Barksdale. The team created the nation's first dinner theatre. They lived upstairs, performed downstairs, and served meals. During the first six years, four of the original founders moved on, leaving Pete Kilgore, Muriel McAuley and newcomer (and newly-wed) Nancy Kilgore firmly in charge. In the seasons that followed, Barksdale produced Greater Richmond's first professional productions of plays by Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neill, George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward, Thornton Wilder, William Inge and Edward \n\n Azeotrope was founded in 2010 by Seattle actor Richard Nguyen Sloniker and director Desdemona Chiang, who met as graduate students at the University of Washington School of Drama.

In 2002, another residence, Graduate House, was incorporated into the University House system although separate routine and daily administration including its identity and admission remain mostly untouched. Traditional Oxbridge formal dinners are available for members, students and faculty every Wednesday evening (so called \"House Dinner\") during semester time however the formality of dress is considerably relaxed to its least degree. University House has been the residence of many notable people, including Gough Whitlam, who moved in for a brief period in 1975 after his removal from the office of Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n The Estufa is a historic structure on the University of New Mexico campus in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was built in 1907–08 by a local social fraternity and has served since 1915 as the primary meeting location of the university's Pi Kappa Alpha chapter. The building's history is steeped in fraternity lore and supposedly no woman has ever seen its interior. It is listed in both the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places. The Estufa is modeled after a kiva, a ceremonial meeting place used by the Pueblo people. It has thick adobe walls and contains a single windowless room with seating around the edges. Construction of the building was guided by university president William G. Tight, who promoted the use of Pueblo Revival architecture on campus. The Estufa was one of the first buildings in New Mexico to employ this style.\n\n The house lies on a historic site, and the seat of a manor, being occupied by a house from the Elizabethan era. At one point the manor was held by Richard Wightwick, who co-founded Pembroke College of the University of Oxford. By 1855 the house was occupied by Henry Mill Bunbury, who had the house remodelled by Mr. W. Butterfield. The current Marlston House was built between 1895 and 1899 by Edward Burgess in the Elizabethan style to replace that remodelled house. It was built for George Palmer, who was one of the founders of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit factory, mayor of the nearby town of Reading, and Member of Parliament for Reading. After George Palmer died in 1897, the house was occupied by his son, George William Palmer, who was also mayor of, and Member of Parliament for, Reading. The house has been used as a school since 1945. It was listed as a grade II* listed building in 1983.\n\n The Phi Mu Sorority House is a historic sorority house at the University of Illinois at Urbana&ndash;Champaign in Urbana, Illinois. The sorority house was built in 1928 for the university's Delta Beta chapter of the Phi Mu sorority, which formed in 1921; the sorority itself was founded in 1852 and is one of the oldest sororities in the United States. At the time, the university had one of the largest Greek letter society movements in the country. The sorority's house has a Spanish Eclectic design with an arcaded porch and large patio, a campanile on one corner, and a colored tile roof. Phi Mu used the house until moving to a new building after World War II; the building has since been used by other Greek and student life groups.

According to Edwards, the screenplay took only one month to write. Julie Andrews watched the 1933 version to prepare for her role. The film had been planned as early as 1978 with Julie Andrews to star alongside Peter Sellers, but Sellers died in 1980 while Andrews and Blake Edwards were filming S.O.B. (1981), so Robert Preston was cast in the role of Toddy. The costume worn by Julie Andrews in the number \"The Shady Dame from Seville\" is in fact the same costume worn by Robert Preston at the end of the film. It was made to fit Preston, and then, using a series of hooks and eyes at the back, it was drawn in tight to fit Andrews' shapely figure. Black silk ruffles were added to the bottom of the garment to hide the differences in height.

The Scottish regalia of Charles II, who was crowned King of Scotland in 1651, also survive even though Cromwell made an attempt to seize and destroy them. In England, Cromwell declined invitations by Parliament to be made king and became Lord Protector. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall in 1657, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown—perhaps made of gilded base metal, as was typical of funerary crowns in those days—was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.\n\n If a State Opening occurs before a coronation, the crown is placed on a cushion beside the monarch. In 1689, one week after being proclaimed king, William III wore his crown in Parliament to pass the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689. Only three people are allowed to touch the crown: the monarch, the Archbishop of Canterbury during the coronation ceremony, and the Crown Jeweller, who is responsible for the crown's maintenance, as well as keeping it secure whenever it leaves the Tower of London. When not in use, the Imperial State Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.\n\n The coronation service was held on Sunday 15 January. The Little Device stipulates that the monarch was to enter Westminster Hall at seven o'clock in the morning. After being censed by the Archbishop of York, the queen walked the short distance to the abbey in procession, flanked by the Earls of Pembroke and Shrewsbury and her train carried by the Duchess of Norfolk. She was followed by other nobles carrying the coronation swords, the orb and three crowns which were borne by the Kings of Arms, all accompanied by the Choir of the Chapel Royal singing the processional hymn Salve festa \n\n On Saturday 23 June 1509, the traditional eve-of-coronation procession to Westminster was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd. As was the custom, the couple spent the night before their coronation at the Tower of London. On Midsummer's Day, Sunday, 24 June 1509, Henry VIII and Catherine were anointed and crowned together by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was followed by a banquet in Westminster Hall. Many new Knights of the Bath were created in honour of the coronation. In that month that followed, many social occasions presented the new Queen to the English public. She made a fine impression and was well received by the people of England.\n\n Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William. Ealdred crowned William king on Christmas Day 1066. An innovation in William's coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning, Ealdred asked the assembled crowd, in English, if it was their wish that William be crowned king. The Bishop of Coutances then did the same, but in Norman French. In March 1067, William took Ealdred with him when William returned to Normandy, along with the other English leaders Earl Edwin of Mercia, Earl Morcar, Edgar the Ætheling, and Archbishop Stigand. Ealdred at Whitsun 1068 performed the coronation of Matilda, William's wife. The Laudes Regiae, or song commending a ruler, that was performed at Matilda's coronation may have been composed by Ealdred himself for the occasion. \n\nQuestion: When was John's eldest son crowned?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Her aunt, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, mother of future kings and Alice's first cousins, Edward IV and Richard III, was another key figure in the dynastic civil wars that dominated most of the latter half of 15th century England. Alice's other siblings included Lady Joan Neville, Countess of Arundel; Cecily Neville, Duchess of Warwick; John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu; George Neville, Archbishop of York and Chancellor of England; Lady Eleanor Neville (who died in 1472 before her husband was created Earl of Derby); Lady Katherine Neville, Baroness Hastings; \n\n Lady Alice was the third daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury jure uxoris and Lady Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury suo jure. By her father she was a descendant of King Edward III through the legitimised children of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and his mistress, later wife, Katherine Roët. Her mother was the only child and sole heiress of Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury by his first wife Lady Eleanor Holland. Lady Alice was the sister of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age.

William married Joan, daughter of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford. They had the following children: William was killed in a tournament at Croydon in 1286, predeceasing his father. It has been suggested that this was murder, planned in advance by William's enemies. On the 6th Earl's death the title went to John, the only son of William. John died without legitimate children, so on his death the title passed to Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, eldest son of Edmund FitzAlan and John's sister Alice.\n\n In 1247, a year after her mother's death, Alice accompanied the new papal legate William of Modena, the Cardinal-bishop of Sabina, to England, which she had decided to make her home, and live at the expense of the Crown. In August of that year, her half-brother, King Henry married her to John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (August 1231 – 29 September 1304). The marriage caused some resentment amongst the English nobility, as they considered the king's Lusignan siblings to be parasites and a liability to the kingdom. Many prestigious honours and titles were granted to the Lusignans. Alice was also said to have been disdainful of all things English. John was the son of William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey and Maud Marshal.

Henry's young son, Henry VI of England, who is 20 years, 323 days days old at the time, is crowned king of both England and France. However, in central France, the Dauphin continues the war. \n\n Philip the Good, the new Duke of Burgundy, then entered into an alliance with the English, which resulted in the Treaty of Troyes. This treaty disinherited the Dauphin Charles and handed the succession to Henry V through a marriage to Charles VI's daughter, Catherine of Valois. The treaty named Henry \"regent and heir of France\" (although the English only had effective control over northern France and Guyenne) until Charles's death. The treaty was denounced by the Armagnacs, who reasoned \"that the king belongs to the crown and not vice versa\". Despite his expectations, Henry V predeceased his sickly father-in-law by a few months, in 1422. In 1429, the intervention of Joan of Arc culminated in a successful coronation campaign that allowed Charles VII to be crowned at Reims Cathedral, the traditional coronation site of French kings, on 17 July 1429. The ten-year-old Henry VI of England was crowned as King of France on 16 December 1431 at Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n Mary Arundell was the only child of Sir John Arundell (c.1474 – 8 February 1545) of Lanherne, Cornwall, and his second wife, Katherine Grenville (born 1489-93), a daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (d.1513). Mary Arundell's father, Sir John Arundell (d.1545), was the son and heir of Sir Thomas Arundell (c.1452–1485) (who after the defeat of King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth (1485) supported Henry Tudor's claim to the throne) by his wife Katherine Dynham, one of the four sisters and coheirs of John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (c.1433 – 1501). Sir John Arundell was made a Knight of the Bath when the future King Henry VIII was created Duke of York in 1494, and led troops against the Cornish rebels in 1497 and in \n\n Katherine Brandon (née Willoughby), Duchess of Suffolk, suo jure 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby (22 March 1519 – 19 September 1580), was an English noblewoman living at the courts of King Henry VIII, King Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I. She was the fourth wife of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who acted as her legal guardian during his third marriage to Henry VIII's sister Mary. Her second husband was Richard Bertie, a member of her household. Following Charles Brandon's death in 1545, it was rumoured that King Henry had considered marrying Katherine as his seventh wife, while he was still married to his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, who was Katherine's close friend. An outspoken supporter of the English Reformation, she fled abroad to Wesel and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the reign of Queen Mary I, to avoid persecution.\n\n Katherine was born in 1271 in Brimpsfield, Gloucestershire, to John Giffard, 1st Baron Giffard, the owner of Brimpsfield Castle, and Maud de Longspée, a great-granddaughter of King John. In 1287 or 1288, when Katherine was 15 or 16 years old, she married Baron Nicholas de Audley and had two sons and a daughter, the first when she was 17 years old. After both her husband and her father died in 1299, she came into a large inheritance, including lands and property in Carmarthenshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Cheshire.

What may have started as a minor illness or injury increases in severity until the young person is unable to sit up or speak in more than a whisper and may find even the touch of bedclothes excruciatingly painful. The pain and fatigue often bring with them symptoms of nausea and intolerable insensitivity to light and sound. Many young people have told us that they have received “no understanding” and been treated with disbelief and criticism because there has been no medical diagnosis to give credibility to their experience. This paper tells the story of a reciprocal witnessing workshop adapted from outsider witnessing practices [1,2] for a group of young people who were previously in treatment and those who are currently in treatment on the adolescent unit.\nUniversity College London Hospital (UCLH) is a large public health service hospital in London, England. Our clinical psychology team works alongside the medical team of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists with children and young people affected by different physical illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer and gastric conditions. Our team works with a systemic approach to help these young people and their families manage the challenges created by these illnesses. Solution focused, narrative and motivational interviewing approaches are regularly integrated into our practice .\nYoung people affected by debilitating symptoms of pain and fatigue for which doctors have not found standard (diagnostic) explanations are frequently referred to our service. In this paper we tell the story of a workshop we facilitated for young people affected by these sorts of symptoms. We will go on to explain how we made use of experience consultants  and outsider witness practices  and describe the effects of the workshop on the young people who took part. We will highlight how the workshop provided an opportunity for young people designated as ‘patients’ in the hospital to hear and share stories of resilience with other young people invited as the experience consultants because they had worked with us in the past and found ways to get their lives back on track. A process of mutual witnessing between these two groups (‘young people’ and ‘experience consultants’) opened space for stories of hope to be told and lived.\nFatigue and pain trouble many young people with a third of adolescents reported as complaining of substantial fatigue four or more times a week . With some young people the fatigue and pain take an upper hand and prevent them from attending school or getting on with their lives. When extensive medical investigations fail to find a cause for the pain and fatigue, the symptoms often start attracting labels such as ‘psychosomatic’ or ‘conversion syndrome’ and are construed as ‘unreal’ or ‘imaginary’. These labels can direct young people and families towards traditional mental health treatment services where treatment models might assume that a psychic trauma has triggered the symptoms or that the symptoms are ‘functional’. Therapy is therefore directed towards uncovering the event that the young person and their family are presumed unable to describe or speak about and often limits access to other treatments of the physical symptoms by physiotherapy or occupational therapy.\nBecause of poor outcomes within mental health settings, some teams have started providing treatment involving emotional, physical and relational interventions within multidisciplinary medical systems. We participate in this sort of multidisciplinary approach at UCLH. The discourses informing systemic and narrative approaches differ from the traditional medical discourse that uses the language of diagnosis, designates young people as ‘patients’ and assumes that medical tests can objectively distinguish the ‘reality’ of symptoms. Therefore as psychologists working systemically with colleagues within a medical setting, we try to find ways to join respectfully with the team and introduce different ways of thinking about and talking with the young people and families we work with which is not too unusual for our colleagues yet also affirming and appreciative of the young people’s perspectives .\nLike Michael White  we hold that we live our lives according to the stories we tell ourselves and the stories we are told by others . These stories talk to us of who we are, who we were and who we can become. Thus our stories are constitutive, both forming and informing our identities. Illness, pain and fatigue tend to dictate the sorts of stories told of and by the young person. Michael White  described our sense of self as a ‘territory of identity’. He explained how problems like trauma can act to shrink this territory, our sense of who we are, thereby disconnecting us from our abilities to influence our own lives and those of others. Without a sense of who we are it is difficult to go on, to make decisions, to dream of our future, since to participate in these life affirming activities, we need to be standing on the safe ground of who we are. We have seen how Pain and Fatigue – especially when teaming up together over many years - can not only shrink but also sometimes even erode the territory of identity of young people. Fatigue often works in tandem with Pain to pin young people to ‘sick’ beds for extensive periods of time thereby isolating them from many of the experiences of their peers such as school, social life and family. The young people we work with often speak of how Pain, Fatigue and Illness take over their lives to the point of defining who they are, for example “a sick person”, ”a patient”’; “a CF person”.\nNarrative practices involve enabling people to tell stories about their lives in ways that make them stronger [9,10] or enables them to go on. The process of externalising ‘pain’ and ‘fatigue’ enables young people’s to begin to separate problems from their identity and move towards a richer description of their lives. For these stories to live and breathe they also need an audience. Pain and Fatigue often disconnect young people from audiences to the stories they want told about themselves and who might witness and appreciate their preferred versions of self. Even when preferred stories begin to emerge in therapy, they are often witnessed by only a therapist and one or two family members and therefore risk remaining fragile. The Narrative approach offers practices to extend the audience to these stories through the use of certificates, letters and celebrations [11-13]. Outsider witnessing also offers the opportunity to invite an audience to witness preferred identity stories.\nInspired by Barbara Myerhoff’s  work with older Jewish people in California, Michael White developed outsider witnessing practices, which create opportunities to invite an audience to witness people’s preferred identity stories . In outsider witnessing one or several people are invited to join a session. In the first instance the witnesses are asked to listen whilst the interviewer interviews the ‘clients’, creating space for the telling of preferred identity stories. Then the clients are invited to listen as the interviewer interviews the outsider witnesses.\nThe interviewer is typically guided by four types of ‘outsider witness’ questions that invite the witnesses to 1) select something the client has said that was particularly meaningful to the witness (Identifying the Expression); 2) say something about the image this phrase or expression evoked for the witness of what was important to the client (Identifying the Image); 3) make connections between their own values or experiences and that of the clients (Embodying Responses), and 4) reflect on how they have been influenced by the clients’ story and what contribution it makes to their own future life (Acknowledging Transport). Finally the interviewer invites the ‘clients’ to comment on what they have heard from the witnesses [2,15].\nThe intention of outsider witness questions is to bring forth detailed personal links to the client’s preferred ways of living and to thicken the under-noticed narratives of their life. Michael White talks of how the witnesses’ response to the ‘Transport’ question (eg How is your life / work different for what you have heard today?) is particularly important. Many people who have experienced trauma or other overwhelming problems in their lives have very little sense of influence on their own lives or the lives of others. Hearing the impact that their story has had on others and the contribution their story makes to others’ lives can be a validating experience that opens space for further positive developments of self [2,16].\nAll the young people on the adolescent in-patient ward at UCLH have the opportunity to attend a weekly therapeutic group that aims to provide a forum to discuss issues related to both illness and adolescence . When we evaluated the group, the young people fed back that they liked meeting others like themselves who were living with similar symptoms or conditions. They said they would also like to meet with young people who were further along the journey of recovery than they were. It was from their feedback that the idea of the witnessing workshop was born.\nWe asked our multidisciplinary hospital team to help us identify experience consultants who had previously used our service and current ‘patients’ who might like to meet with them. We planned to follow the conventional outsider witness practice of interviewing the patients (whom we will now refer to as ‘young people’) so they could share their stories; then inviting the experience consultants to act as outsider witnesses, and finally inviting the young people to reflect on the effects of listening to the experience consultants. When we explained this process to the young people the day before the workshop, however, they told us that they preferred to have the experience consultants talk about their experience first rather than only tell their own. Therefore with short notice and the agreement of the experience consultants, we decided to adapt the traditional outsider witnessing format and created what became a ‘reciprocal witnessing’ session.\nThree young people with varying degrees of chronic fatigue and chronic pain syndrome (H,17; A,17; G,16 and four experience consultants (two with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, T,20; R,23 and 2 with chronic pain, L,18; S,19; participated in the workshop. Deborah convened the workshop and in addition Fiona and the ward social worker, who both co-facilitated the young people’s group on the ward, joined the young people. The session was held in the schoolroom on the ward. Two of the young people were inpatients and were bedbound (A & H) and another used a stick to help her walk (G). One of the experience consultants came in a wheelchair (L).\nWe began with interviewing the experience consultants about the steps they had taken to reclaim their lives from Pain and Fatigue. Then we invited the young people to respond to the stories of the experience consultants using version of the outsider witness questions presented in Table 1. We went on to interview the young people about their experiences, following a reauthoring interview map [1,2] to bring forth their preferred identity stories. Finally we invited the experience consultants to witness the young people’s stories. We then reflected on the process together, positioning the all the young people as experts to feed back to us about their experience.\nWe were aware that exhaustion and pain can limit the amount of time young people can participate before needing to rest. Therefore to ensure sufficient time to give everyone a chance to speak, we invited the experience consultants into the room first to explain how we would work. Deborah checked if they would be willing to begin sharing their own experiences and have the young people respond to this. She also gave them a ‘preview’ of the questions she we would be asking them (There was also the opportunity to try these questions out through an example interview. Deborah interviewed Fiona about her work with young people and then asked the experience consultants the outsider witnessing questions, allowing the opportunity to de-brief afterwards).\nAfter the young people joined the workshop and all had introduced themselves, Deborah invited each experience consultant to tell the story of how the pain had come into their lives; how they coped when things had been when at their worst; how they came to be involved with the hospital team, and how the situation was currently.\nWith the intention of bringing forth stories of coping, survival, achievements and positive developments in their lives, Deborah went on to invite the experience consultants to explain how they had made these steps of progress, what skills and personal resources they had drawn on in order to do this and their hopes for the future. (Do you remember that journey? What was it that helped you to get to the point you are at now? I am curious about, when you were on the ward and going through treatment and kind of struggling in different ways with it all: what helped you to keep going? What most helped when you were really in that worst place? So, when you look back from your position now, what were the skills you used to keep yourself going? What helped move you over into getting your life back? What are your plans for the future?).\nDespite these experiences, they had all been to, or were on their way to university. Three of them had part time employment, and they all had activities or hobbies they pursued, from photography to dancing on tables! All four of them described some on-going symptoms of pain or fatigue but the interference of these symptoms in their daily life was much reduced. Seeing other young people relating with their doctors differently helped them find new ways of being with doctors to achieve the outcomes they wanted. They said letting people in was a very gradual process of “taking the bricks of (my)defences off one by one” and letting those working with them “see the real me”.\nDeborah invited the young people to witness the experience consultants’ stories using questions like those in Table 1. We kept this part of the session relatively short to ensure enough time for a fuller witnessing of the young people’s own stories.\nWhat in particular encouraged or inspired you?\nWhat did you hear that struck you or touched you?\nWhat did this suggest to you about the young people’s values /hopes /dreams /commitments - that is important to them?\nWhat picture or image did [what you heard] bring to your mind?\nWhat in your own life / work connected you to the young people?\nWhich aspects of your own life / work resonated with what you heard?\nWhere has what you have heard today taken you?\nWhere have you been moved to in your thinking or experience of life or work?\nHow is your life / work different for what you have heard today?\nHow have you been influenced?\nThe young people described feeling a sense of hope from hearing the stories of the experience consultants. This seemed to show itself immediately since they started speaking of the progress they had already made when relating their own experience.\nDeborah went on to ask the experience consultants the four outsider witnessing questions (Table 1). For the sake of space we share here just a few of the ideas and responses that most stood out for us.\nMany of their images reflected hope. Joel described an image of hope, illustrated by Bob Marley singing ‘don’t worry…… about a thing…’ The other experience consultants described that having the young people witness their progress and then having the opportunity to witness the young people’s hopes for the future created a powerful image of hope for all of them.\nTaking part in the witnessing workshop connected them with others in a similar position – they shared contact details with the other experience consultants thereby creating their own virtual ‘anti-pain league’ .\nThe experience consultants were still on their own journey themselves, continuing to find ways to live their lives in the context of the pain they were suffering. They talked about how the process of sharing their own stories and hearing the young people’s responses had enabled them to reflect on their own lives and to gain a sense of their emotional strength: “It helps to remind me, to stay focused, to know where I’m going to, to keep me in the frame of mind of what I want to achieve and reminds me what I have achieved”.\nSince the workshop we have been privileged to see further signs of its effects and we share a couple of examples here. As G left the workshop she turned to Fiona and said, “When is the next one of these and please can I put my name down for it?” A few weeks later she arrived at her medical appointment with her walking stick neatly folded up in her bag, She had walked to the session without it for the first time and her progress continued over the following weeks such that she started back at school not long after that.\nAt a review meeting with our multidisciplinary team the mother of A who had attended the workshop a month before spoke of the “profound effect” the workshop had had on her son. She described how it had enabled him to talk to her about things he had never talked about before. The young person himself spoke of how reassuring he had found it to hear of others who had been in a similar situation and had “come out the other end”.\nWe shared stories of the witnessing workshop in our multidisciplinary ward rounds. We shared quotes from the day that reflected perseverance, persistence, courage and hope. Members of the team including medical and nursing staff were intrigued to hear about the young persons’ commitments to their futures as well as delighted to hear about the progress made by young people they had previously worked with. Sharing the sense of hope created in the workshop by all the young people offered encouragement and inspiration to team members who had not taken part.\nSome of the experience consultants have gone on to join us presenting the reciprocal witnessing workshop at conferences and study days where we describe the principles informing the workshop and our experiences running it. A young person then shares their experiences with the audience giving the audience, positioned as outsider witnesses, an opportunity to practice the questions and experience answering them for themselves. We have had very positive feedback from participants on all sessions with comments about its impact on their personal as well as professional lives.\nConducting the reciprocal witnessing workshop and talking about it at conferences has had an impact on all of us as individuals and as therapists. It has reminded us that hearing stories of hope and the possibility of change from those who have been in a similar position and talk from experience is much more powerful than hearing it from ‘professionals’ or ‘experts’. Witnessing how the transforming impact of this approach helpful it has been has moved us to think how to use the approach with different groups of young people and parents.\nA vivid image that stays with us from the workshop is of ‘passing the baton’ evoked by L, one of the experience consultants, telling A, one of the young people, “I am handing over the baton to you, mate…. next time it will be you doing this job and some others will in your bed here”. Three years later A has participated in 2 workshops as an experience consultant. Two further workshops have been run with different members of the team invited to join. Following the last workshop we created a word picture from the feedback the participants gave we used this image to create a thank you letter which we sent to all participants. We created this therapeutic document with the intention of capturing their words and to provide an opportunity to ‘spread the news’ through being able to share it with others [11-13]. Both the young people and experience consultants in all the groups have said that they would recommend the group to other young people. They described it as a ‘motivational group, which gives you a push’ and ‘Story telling from different angles’. In terms of the process they reflected how it was helpful in ‘talking about something in a very positive way’ and ‘a positive thing to encourage each other’’.\nAn unexpected consequence has been the positive effect the workshops have had on the outsider witnesses. The experience consultants were still on their own journey themselves, continuing to find ways to live their lives in the context of the pain they were suffering. They talked about how the process of sharing their own stories and hearing the young people’s responses had enabled them to reflect on their own lives and to gain a sense of their emotional strength: “It helps to remind me, to stay focused, to know where I’m going to, to keep me in the frame of mind of what I want to achieve and reminds me what I have achieved”. They have described the positive effects of how telling of their own stories in this way has helped them to realise how far they have come and reflect on the distance they have travelled since first joining the team. One of the experience consultants fed back that she ‘found it really beneficial for my own journey’ and another voiced ‘it’s nice to tell my story and it reinforces how far I’ve come and that a bad day is just a day, I’ll get over it’.\nWe were struck by the comment of one of the outsider witnesses who reflected on what they had learnt about their journey. This powerful message resonated with the group, including the professionals that took part: ‘Everything is going to be okay in the end but if it’s not okay then it’s not the end’.\nWhite M (1995) Reflecting teamwork as definitional ceremony.

The captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque (the future Marshal Leclerc), then instructor at Saint-Cyr, participated in the military training of Iris XVI. Renowned for his difficult character, Iris XVI did not fail to disconcert his riders. Captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque owed his limp and cane to a fall from Iris XVI's back, resulting in a fractured tibia, with lifelong sequelae. This part of the history of Iris XVI remains unverifiable, due to its age. Iris XVI had become an excellent racehorse, particularly in the steeple-chase on Maisons-Laffitte racecourses. He was not ridden in the race by captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque because he was too tall and heavy. When captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque was deployed to Africa, the horse continued his racing career with Captain Jean Fanneau de La Horie, with whom he gained notoriety in Nazi Germany. Iris XVI was not mobilized during the Second World War, because of his notoriety or unsuitability.\n\nQuestion: What month did the person who retained trust in Longchamp go away to the Holy Land?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ranulph of Mortimer joined the ranks of the Rebellion of 1088 against the new King of England, William Rufus. Together with Norman, English and Welsh Marcher Lords, they invaded and conquered the lands of Hereford, Gloucester and Worcestershire. A year later, the revolt failed and the marches of Normandy, from Maine to the Evrecin, were in disorder. King Rufus took advantage of this opportunity to align with the barons of Upper Normandy by bribing them. Of these barons, Ranulph maintained his land by accepting a bribe from the King in which he had to give his support to England. He did this by garrisoning his castle and sacking surrounding enemy territories as an attack against the new Duke of Normandy, Robert Curthose. The Norman baron allegiance set the stage for a race between the heirs of William I, where the Duke of Normandy and the King of England sought to gain as much support from powerful and influential houses as possible against each other.\n\n effort, and was a theatre where Louis’ war minister, Louvois, had striven to bring together an even larger army than had been assembled the year before. These attacks on Nice and Mons were planned for very early in the campaign season, illustrating Vauban’s dictum that \"It is a very favourable circumstance to be able to attack before the enemy takes the field in strength … \" Meanwhile, in Ireland the war continued into 1691, but William now felt secure enough on his new throne in the British Isles to return to the war on the Continent. William entered The Hague on 5 February to organise his army for the coming campaign. After securing forces totalling 220,000 men, the Stadtholder-King retired to his country home. In mid-March, surrounded by representatives of the Grand Alliance, he received news that Mons was under siege.\n\n The peace secured by the treaty was an uneasy one. When negotiations over the disputed Cumbrian territories broke down with the new King of England, William Rufus, Malcolm invaded northern England again and besieged Alnwick Castle. Unexpectedly a relief column arrived, that was led by the Earl of Northumbria. Malcolm and his son were killed at the ensuing Battle of Alnwick (1093). In 1173 William the Lion of Scotland supported a rebellion against Henry II of England. In 1174, William was captured at the Battle of Alnwick (1174). He was transferred to Falaise in Normandy. There William signed the Treaty of Falaise effectively surrendering Scotland to Henry. Henry then handed Scotland back to William as a fief, in return for William's homage to Henry. However, after Henry II's death, William petitioned Richard I of England to be released from the terms imposed on Scotland by the treaty. Richard, needing to raise finance for the Third Crusade accepted William's offer of 10,000 marks, and at Canterbury on 5 December 1189 released him from all allegiance and subjection for the kingdom of Scotland, which remained an independent realm until Edward I's successful revival of English claims of overlordship in 1291-2.\n\n William was pincerna (cup bearer or butler) to Malcolm IV and William the Lion, succeeding his uncle, Ranulf I de Soules, although the exact dates that he held this position are unknown. He witnessed some of the later charters of Malcolm IV, in one of which he is styled pincerna, and he is also styled as such in some of the early charters of William the Lion, and in a charter that he himself granted in 1171. During the years 1173-74, three of Henry II of England's sons and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, rebelled against him. In 1174, believing Henry II to be distracted by the fighting in France, William the Lion attempted to regain Northumberland for Scotland. He was captured at the Second Battle of Alnwick and taken to Henry in Falaise in Normandy. In order to regain his freedom, in December, 1174 \n\n William had inherited the title of Earl of Northumbria in 1152. However, he had to give up this title to King Henry II of England in 1157. He spent much of his reign trying to regain his lost territory. In 1173, whilst Henry II was occupied in fighting against his sons in the Revolt of 1173–1174, William saw his opportunity and invaded Northumbria. He advanced on Newcastle but found the partly built stone castle too strong to allow him to take the town. He also attacked Prudhoe Castle but found the defences too strong. Unwilling to undertake a lengthy siege, William returned to Scotland. \n\nQuestion: When did a storm disperse the fleet led by the English king who trusted William de Longchamp?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was based on the poem The King's Breakfast by A.A. Milne.\n\n authorship of the Epistola. King probably created the whole controversy. At the opening of the Radcliffe Camera, on 13 April 1749, King delivered a Latin speech in the Sheldonian Theatre. In it he expressed his Jacobitism: he introduced six times the word redeat (\"that he may return\"), pausing each time, amid loud applause. Thomas Warton, in his poem The Triumph of Isis, eulogised King's powers of oratory. In praising the trustees of the library, King was complimenting Jacobites among them: the Duke of Beaufort, Sir Walter Wagstaffe Bagot, and Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. But one view is that the protest was no longer dynastic, being concerned with the Whig handling of the Church. The audience included key supporters of the Hanoverian heir Frederick, Prince \n\n including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. Slumdog Millionaire was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director (Danny Boyle), producer (Christian Colson), screenwriter (Simon Beaufoy) and star (Dev Patel)—the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador. It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film. The King's Speech, which tells the story of King George VI's attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by Tom Hooper and filmed almost entirely in London. It received four Academy Awards \n\n Phillip (Arliss), the figurehead monarch of an unnamed country, is unharmed in an assassination attempt. In a conversation with his attempted murderer, Anderson, it becomes clear that the king's sympathies are with the downtrodden people. As unrest builds, Phillip abdicates to avoid bloodshed. Phillip had come to the throne unexpectedly 18 years before, and had been forced to give up his commoner wife Helen (Gateson) and their infant daughter and marry Margaret (played by Arliss's real-life wife Florence). He is prepared to remain married, but Margaret (aware of his lost love) informs him that she too had someone she loved. She refuses to reveal the man's identity, referring to him only as \"Mr. X\".

In the West End stage adaptation of The King's Speech at Wyndham's Theatre, Australian actor Jonathan Hyde played Lionel Logue, and in the US stage premiere, Logue was played by James Frain.

Three selections were songs made famous by Kitty Wells and the three others were traditional ballads. After graduating high school in May 1964, Parton moved to Nashville the next day. Her initial success came as a songwriter, when Fred Foster, owner of Combine Music and Monument Records, signed Parton to a publishing and recording deal. During this early period at Monument, Parton wrote songs that were recorded by a variety of artists, including Bill Phillips, Skeeter Davis, Hank Williams Jr., and even Kitty Wells. Foster originally felt that Parton's voice was not suited for country and tried to market \n\n Meredith Leigh Edwards (born March 15, 1984) is an American country music singer. She recorded an album, Reach, for Mercury Records Nashville in 2001. This album accounted for two singles on the Billboard country singles charts. At the age of five, she was a member of the traveling choir the Mississippi Show Stoppers, along with Lance Bass of *NSYNC. Lance had signed Meredith to his own management called Free Lance Entertainment. In 2001, she released her first CD, Reach, under the Mercury label. The album debuted at No. 24 on the Top Country Albums chart and was produced by Richard Marx. Its singles, \"A Rose Is a Rose\" and \"The Bird Song\", both charted on Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) at No. 37 and No. 47 respectively. Edwards has not recorded since Reach.\n\n Robert Jerome \"Bobby\" Borchers (born June 19, 1952 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an American country music singer. Borchers was raised in Kentucky. He learned to play guitar at age twelve, and got his first break in the mid-1970s, when Tanya Tucker recorded his song \"Jamestown Ferry.\" In the mid-1970s, recorded for the Playboy Records label. Borchers released two albums for Playboy: Bobby Borchers in 1977 and Denim and Rhinestones a year later. He also charted nine times within the Top 40 of the Hot Country Songs charts, including the number seven \"Cheap Perfume and Candlelight\" in 1977. Borchers later moved to Epic Records, where he released three singles: \"Sweet Fantasy,\" \"Wishing I Had Listened to Your Song\" and \"I Just Wanna Feel the Magic.\" Borchers also owned the Longhorn Ballroom restaurant in Fort Wright, Kentucky in the 1980s. In 1987, he issued two singles on Longhorn Records: \"It Was Love What It Was\" and \"(I Remember When I Thought) Whiskey Was a River.\"\n\n Gentry's sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling the Washington Post that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it. Gentry also brought \"Mississippi Delta\" to Capitol on the same demo tape and it was this recording, rather than \"Ode to Billie Joe\", that initially got her signed. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial and reflects what was on the charts in 1967. Gentry most likely recorded the song at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California. She recorded a 12-song demo that would become the basis of her debut album. Gentry was officially signed to Capitol Records on June 23, 1967. The \"demo\" tracks became the album masters; the purchased recording of \"Mississippi Delta\" was the version issued, but \"Ode to Billie Joe\" had a string arrangement by Jimmie Haskell dubbed onto the original recording at Capitol. It was the day after the string session that Capitol's A&R team decided definitively that \"Ode to Billie Joe\" would be the A-side.\n\n \"I Belong to You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Toni Braxton.

As of 2019, its total population is 63,554, out of which the population of Krasnystaw is 18,675 and the rural population is 44,879.\n\n Przemysław \"Przemek\" Ogrodziński was born to a Polish family in Lemberg (modern Lviv, Ukraine) in the Austrian Empire. Lemberg was the capital of the Austrian province of Galicia, a region that spanned modern southeastern Poland and western Ukraine. Galicia was populated by a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, and Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews. Shortly after Ogrodziński's birth, Galicia became part of the newly re-established Poland and Lemberg became the Polish city of Lwów. Ogrodziński graduated in law from Jagiellonian University in Kraków, before returning to his hometown, where he became active in the Związek Niezależnej Młodzieży Socjalistycznej (Union of Independent Socialist Youth). As an young socialist activist in Lwów, Ogrodziński had many Jewish friends who were active in the Socialist movement.\n\n Archacki was born in a very small village located approximately 50 miles North of Warsaw, Poland known as Pieczyska.

She was named after John Witherspoon, a Scottish-American Presbyterian minister and a Founding Father of the United States. Politically active, Witherspoon was a delegate from New Jersey to the Second Continental Congress and a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence. Later, he signed the Articles of Confederation and supported ratification of the Constitution. In 1789 he was convening moderator of the First General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.\n\n Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church was founded in 1839 in Princeton, New Jersey. The church was formed after the Nassau Presbyterian Church allowed 90 of the 131 former African American members to form their own church, after a fire had devastated the Nassau church. The church is among New Jersey's oldest African American Presbyterian congregations. The sanctuary was built in 1840 in the Greek Revival style. The recessed entrance was a new and common design feature on religious architecture of the time. The church was first called the \"First Presbyterian Church of Color of Princeton\", but reported to the General Assembly in 1845 as the \"Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church\". Betsey Stockton, \n\n may have been the first black Presbyterian missionary in the U.S. helped found the church after she returned to Princeton in 1835 from her work as a missionary in Hawaii. Reverend William Drew Robeson led the church as pastor from 1879. Robeson moved into the church parsonage with his wife Maria Louisa Bustill of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and their they raised their children, including Paul Robeson. Reverend Robeson was a former slave, and as such he preached racial equality, which eventually led to his forced resignation in 1901 for being \"too radical.\" In 2018 the church installed a new pastor, Reverend Lukata Mjumbe, a graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary.\n\n Presbyterian church and associated classical school. He remained there after his brother's 1751 death and became pastor, and head of the school, until 1767. He then moved to Princeton, New Jersey where the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) was located to accept a position of Professor of Theology that was funded by a bequeath of Rev Samuel Finley who died in 1767. He was also appointed Trustee, Vice-President, and acting president until appointed President John Witherspoon was able to arrive. As the funds to support the Professorship were insufficient, and Witherspoon was able to teach and lead the college, it was agreed that Blair would resign as Professor. He then agreed to be pastor at the Good Will Church in Wallkill, New York where he remained until his death in 1771. He was buried at the cemetery of the church.\n\n John Witherspoon (February 5, 1723 – November 15, 1794) was a Scottish American Presbyterian minister, educator, farmer, slaveholder, and a Founding Father of the United States. Witherspoon embraced the concepts of Scottish common sense realism, and while president of the College of New Jersey (1768–1794; now Princeton University) became an influential figure in the development of the United States' national character. Politically active, Witherspoon was a delegate from New Jersey to the Second Continental Congress and a signatory to the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence. He was the only active clergyman and the only college president to sign the Declaration. Later, he signed the Articles of Confederation and supported ratification of the Constitution.

He was descended from a family of scholars and professors. His father Robert Wodrow was a historian of the Church of Scotland with a \"national reputation\" and published his history in 1752, the same year as Wodrow's birth. Two other members of Wodrow's family filled, in succession, the \"chair of theology\" at the University of Glasgow and another Wodrow family member served as the university's librarian. Wodrow immigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1768.\n\n Still, in August 1560 the 'Reformation Parliament' abolished the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland with the Papal Jurisdiction Act. A Reformed confession of faith was drafted by six ministers: John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas, John Row and John Knox. On 17 August 1560, the document was read twice, article by article, before the Parliament, and the Protestant ministers stood ready to defend \"the cause of truth\" if any article of belief was assailed. When the vote was taken, the Confession was ratified and adopted. An assembly of several ministers and laymen, subsequently known as the first General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in Edinburgh, and the First Book of Discipline (1560) was drawn up. The Second Book of Discipline (1581) was ratified much later by Parliament in 1592 (see General Assembly Act 1592 ). This definitely settled the Presbyterian form \n\n 5 March 1561, he was a member of the privy council from 1561 to 1576. In 1562 he was named as one of the commissioners for receiving rentals of benefices and in October of that year was granted a pension of £1000 Scots from the thirds of benefices pending provision to a benefice of equal or greater value. The Reformation gave him further opportunities to add to the landed estate he had been acquiring since 1552, mainly in East Lothian and Midlothian. Three charters by the commendator and convent of Dunfermline on 28 July 1563 conveyed to him extensive lands, mainly in Haddingtonshire, Edinburghshire, and Fife, amounting to no fewer than seventy-seven farms and scattered holdings. From September 1565 \n\n necessary. Civil war appeared imminent, but each side shrank from the first step. Knox at once became the clerical leader of the reformers. He preached against \"idolatry\" with the greatest boldness, with the result that what he later called the \"rascal multitude\" began the \"purging\" of churches and the destruction of monasteries. Mary of Guise died on 11 June 1560, at which point the youthful Mary Queen of Scots, then resident in France, gave permission, through her husband, Francis II, for Parliament to meet in her absence, but religious questions were specifically to be submitted to the 'intention and pleasure' of the king and queen.\n\n In 1559, John Knox returned to Scotland, marking a new effort in his battle to reform the nation. Scottish Protestants in the 1520s and 1530s were Lutherans such as Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart, who translated the First Helvetic Confession written by Heinrich Bullinger, marking the impact of the Swiss Reformation. With the return of Knox from Geneva Scottish Protestants rallied around him and the Scottish Reformation continued to be characterised by the example of John Calvin in Geneva. Queen dowager Mary of Guise, acting as regent for her daughter Mary, Queen of Scots, wanted to crush the Protestants and felt the use of force would \n\nQuestion: What year did the author of History of the Reformation in Scotland die?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some key primary texts include: Christiane de Pizan's 1450 \"The Book of the City of Ladies\", which was written in praise of women and as a defense of their capabilities and virtues in order to combat against misogynist male writing. Mary Astell's 1694 \"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest,\" argues that women who do not intend to marry should use their dowries to finance residential women's colleges to provide the recommended education for upper- and middle-class women. Olympe de Gouges's 1791 \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\", which stated that women, like their male counterparts, have natural, inalienable, and \n\n Critics had tended to read Chudleigh's work biographically, but that began to change in the 1990s, as new evidence on her life emerged. In her early career she could be called a Restoration poet of lyrics and satires, while later she became a philosophical essayist. Heavily influenced by Mary Astell, Lady Mary Chudleigh was one of the first Englishwomen to recognize that as a social group, women faced unique challenges. She wrote overtly feminist works and argued strongly for marriage reform and women's education, believing women should cultivate reason, virtue and stoic integrity, despite living in a world full of misogyny. She also wrote significant poems in the retirement tradition, combining Platonic and Christian contemplation as a retreat from the vanities of life. Chudleigh is no longer thought to have written the prose work The Female Advocate (1700), but expressed in her poetry praise for the \"ingenious Pen\" of the unknown, pseudonymous Eugenia who did so.\n\n At age 19, Speght published A Mouzell for Melastomus (London, 1617) (the title means \"a muzzle for black mouth\"), a prose refutation of Joseph Swetnam's misogynistic The Araignment of Lewde, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women (London, 1615). \"Speght is one of the first Western women to recognize, in print, that jokes against women are usually more than just harmless banter. Speght interprets Swetnam's book as a serious attack against women.  The first letter addresses fellow women, and the second is directed to Swetnam himself.  In both letters she quotes from such classical figures as Aristotle and Tacitus, and she draws from various Greek and Roman myths.\" By employing these devices, Speght establishes \n\n the supporters of Calvinist reformer John Knox, who in the previous year had published a polemic entitled The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women. This pamphlet, intended to undermine Queen Mary and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland, claimed that female leadership was contrary to the laws of nature and to Biblical teaching. Knox's qualified this assertion in the case of Deborah, who had freed the Israelites from the Canaanites and led them to an era of peace and prosperity, and whom Knox claimed had been a God-given and miraculous exception for the salvation of his people.\n\n The company's name referred ironically to the title of John Knox's sixteenth-century pamphlet, The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women. Reacting to what they saw as the marginal status and stereotypical depiction of women in both conventional and political theatre of the time, its founding members decided to create a radical alternative that would provide serious opportunities for women as actors, writers, directors, designers and technicians. Amongst the founding members were three who were to remain actively involved throughout its history: Chris Bowler (until her death in May 2014), Gillian Hanna, and Mary McCusker.

There was a rivalry between the Capetians and the Plantagenêts, Richard as the Plantagenêt king of England was more powerful than the Capetian king of France, despite the fact that Richard was a vassal of the French king and paid homage for his lands in the country. From 1190 to 1192, Richard the Lionheart was on the Third Crusade. He was joined by Philip II of France as each was wary that the other might invade his territory in his absence. Richard was captured and imprisoned on the return journey to England, and he was not released until 4 February 1194. In Richard's absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip's conquests in the period of Richard's imprisonment was the Norman Vexin and a few towns around such as Le Vaudreuil, Verneuil and Évreux. It took Richard until 1198 to reconquer a part of it.\n\n King Richard I of England had been captured and imprisoned by Leopold of Austria on the King's return from crusade in December 1192. For over a year, the terms of his release were negotiated, until he was released on payment of a massive ransom in January 1194. Whilst he was imprisoned, Richard's brother, John, had allied against Richard with the French King, Philip II, who had also wanted to capture the English king. John had granted Philip much land from Richard's estates in Aquitaine. As well as various castles, this included the whole of the duchy lands east of the River Seine. During Richard's imprisonment, Philip had made attempts at physically occupying these estates, with some success, particularly around the important Channel ports of Dieppe (shortest distance between Paris and the English channel) and Le Tréport. However, as soon as Richard returned to Normandy, John made his peace with him, abandoning Philip; Richard proceeded to unravel much of Philip's recent gains in the region, beginning with the raising of Philip's siege of Verneuil on 29 May 1194. There, Philip was forced into a hasty retreat, and, foreshadowing his losses at Fréteval, abandoned his siege engines and other valuable matériel.\n\n Set during Christmas 1183 at Henry II of England's castle in Chinon, Anjou, Angevin Empire, the play opens with the arrival of Henry's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he has had imprisoned since 1173. The story concerns the gamesmanship between Henry, Eleanor, their three surviving sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, and their Christmas Court guest, the King of France, Philip II Augustus (Philippe Auguste), who was the son of Eleanor's ex-husband, Louis VII of France (by his third wife, Adelaide). Also involved is Philip's half-sister Alais (by Louis VII's second wife Constance), who has been at court since she was betrothed to Richard at age eight, but has since become Henry's mistress.\n\nQuestion: What month did the person with whom Henry fought a short war in 1183 go away from the holy land?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Spanish Armada was blown north up the east coast of England and in a hasty strategic move, attempted a return to Spain by sailing around Scotland and out into the Atlantic, past Ireland. But very severe weather destroyed a portion of the fleet, and more than 24 vessels were wrecked on the north and western coasts of Ireland, with the survivors having to seek refuge in Scotland.

Strong winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles.

D'Estaing feared that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, so he boarded the French troops and sailed out to do battle with Howe on August 10. The weather deteriorated into a major storm as the two fleets maneuvered for position and prepared to battle. The storm raged for two days and scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship. It also frustrated Sullivan's plans to attack Newport without French support on August 11. Sullivan began siege operations while awaiting the return of the French fleet, moving closer to the British lines on August 15 and opening trenches to the northeast of the fortified British line north of Newport the next day. As the two fleets sought to regroup, individual ships encountered one another, and there were several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships, already suffering from storm damage, were badly mauled in these encounters, including d'Estaing's flagship.

Picture was well received on the whole, made money. Got me off and going.\" However he never made another film with Bronson. \"We had kind of a falling out over the film,\" the director said. \"He thought I'd been a little too ... how do I put this? Too draconian in my editing of his wife's (Jill Ireland's) scenes.\" The movie established a template to which Hill often returned. \"My heroes usually have a very talkative foil opposite them or reluctantly alongside them, such as Bruce Dern in The Driver, or Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs, or James Coburn in Hard Times. I like the kind of dialogue between people who have a mutual goal but very disparate appetites and needs, so that there's always a kind of friction that runs throughout the film. They don't like each other very much, and hopefully the movie supplies a reason for them to achieve a grudging kind of respect for each other.\"\n\n Hill says he originally wrote the film intending to cast a younger actor, like Jan Michael Vincent, and that he wanted Warren Oates to play Coburn's role. According to Hill, \"they had offered it to a couple of actors and they didn't want to do it.\" Then it was sent to Charles Bronson even though Hill thought he was \"too old\". A day later, Bronson's agent called back and said Bronson had read the script and wanted to do the film \"but he had to meet me. He wanted to see if I measured up.\" Hill remembers that Bronson \"was in remarkable physical condition for a guy his age; I think he was about 52 at the time. He had excellent coordination, and a splendid build. His one problem was that he was a smoker, so he didn't have a lot of stamina. I mean, he probably could have kicked anybody's ass on that movie, but he couldn't fight much longer than 30 or 40 seconds.\" Hill later said Bronson received \"very close to a million\" dollars for his role.\n\n Jeffrey Leon Bridges (born December 4, 1949) is an American actor, singer, producer, and composer.

Two thousand female fans dressed in black gathered outside the ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, New York, in mock mourning. The couple had two sons, D'Andrea (Danny, born 1954) and Daegal (Dae, born 1955). Bennett and his wife Patricia separated in 1965, their marriage a victim of Bennett's spending too much time on the road, among other factors. In 1969, Patricia sued him for divorce on grounds of adultery. In 1971, their divorce became official.

Bennett Smith's sons Thomas and Charles took over his business after Smith's death in Windsor at the age of 87. Today a detailed mural of the Black Watch is painted on the old Hants Journal building on Gerrish Street in Windsor, N.S.as a proud reminder of the community's shipbuilding heritage.\n\n Bennett's wife died a few months before him. They had no children.\n\n He was born on June 21, 1911, in Rockville Centre, Nassau County, New York, the son of Earl Job Bennett (1878–1965) and Edna (Davison) Bennett (1880–1960). He attended South Side High School in Rockville Centre, and graduated from Cornell Law School in 1935. He married Mildred Schwindt, and they had two children.

In May 2017, they released a deluxe version of their album Around the World and Back, along with a DVD of footage from their last few tours. Their 2013 full-length, The Finer Things,  debuted at number 2 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart.

Likened to bands such as U2 and Arcade Fire by music magazines the NME, Drowned In Sound and The Fly. Buchanan's vocals have a strong, Cure-like quality, the band released their first long-playing album in 2006 through Shifty Disco Records (home to Young Knives and [aperlung). Following the album release, the band toured, including residencies at Club NME, as well as appearances at Truck Festival and Reading Festival. In January 2007, the band recorded a session for Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1) at the Maida Vale Studios. The band already had secured radio airplay, having previously performed a session for XFM in June 2005. The band's second album, In My Head It Works, was released in 2009. Marketing for the record included a \"Pass It On\" campaign - a chain letter-style process that distributes promotional copies of the album across the country.\n\n Games of the XXI Olympiad is the fourth album by Melbourne electronica band Black Cab. It was released in 2014. The album continues the theme of their 2009 Call Signs album, which was inspired by Cold War-era East Germany, with the new album themed on the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where a state-sanctioned regimen of performance-enhancing drugs produced a generation of chemically superhuman East German athletes. A version of the album was prepared for release in 2012 but was abandoned when the band decided it was neither complete nor very good. Songs were stripped down and extended, in the process transforming \"Supermädchen\" from four minutes to almost 10. The album, far more electronica-based than its predecessors, was produced in multiple sessions with different producers and mixers, including Woody Annison, Simon Polinski and former Death in Vegas member Tim Holmes. Two earlier singles, \"Combat Boots\" (2011) and \"Sexy Polizei\" (2010) were also included.\n\n Tourist is the second album by English rock band Athlete, released in January 2005. It is thought a more stripped-down, sombre and reflective album than their debut, Vehicles & Animals. The first single from the album, \"Wires\", became the band's biggest hit so far when it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 4. The album also fared well in the charts, reaching the top of the UK Albums Chart the week it was released, selling 89,000 copies. Despite this success, Tourist had a mixed critical reception, with some suggesting that Athlete had failed to sustain the unique style of their previous album, while others saw the new album as a logical progression from their old sound. Despite the mainstream breakthrough the band achieved with this album, the band experienced substantially less commercial success with their follow-up Beyond the Neighbourhood. At the end of 2005, Tourist became the 32nd-best-selling album of the year in the UK, and \"Wires\" was the 89th best-selling single. The album was released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. In 2010, \"Chances\" was featured in the Doctor Who Series 5 episode, \"Vincent and the Doctor\".\n\nQuestion: What is the body of water by the area where Athlete was formed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the only civil parish in the borough of Elmbridge. Surrounded by green belt, it lies inside the Greater London Built-up Area. Claygate was once in the main manor of Thames Ditton, but is now administered from Esher. It is primarily residential and has a small number of offices, outlying farms and two small shopping areas, the Old Village and the Parade, with hair and beauty shops, a supermarket, five pubs and a number of restaurants. Claygate lies on the Claygate Beds, a clay formation up to 15 m thick, which extends well beyond the village. These beds are the youngest part of the London Clay geological formation, forming a transition between the clay and the sandier Bagshot Beds above.\n\n A group of five Bronze Age round barrows lies on high ground in the northeast of the parish. Domesday Book recorded a settlement at Otone in 1086, with 69 households, two churches, and land held by Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey, Normandy. The name Wootton Rivers was in use in the 14th century: 'Wootton' meant 'farm by the wood' and 'Rivers' was the surname of the lords of the manor. An eastern part of the parish was part of Savernake Forest in the 14th century, but today the edge of the forest is just beyond the northeast corner of the parish. The population of the parish peaked at 470 in 1841, and has remained below 300 since 1921.

Forming the southeastern line of the parish boundary is an old track linking prehistoric Buzbury Rings, on nearby Keyneston Hill, to a ford over the river. St Leonards farmhouse used to house a leper hospital. The parish church was rebuilt in 1862.\n\n  Thames Ditton is a suburban village by and on the River Thames, in the Elmbridge borough of Surrey, England. Apart from a large inhabited island in the river, it lies on the southern bank, centred 12.2 miles (19.6 km) southwest of Charing Cross in central London. Thames Ditton is just outside Greater London but within the Greater London Urban Area as defined by the Office for National Statistics. Its clustered village centre and shopping area on a winding High Street is surrounded by housing, schools and sports areas. Its riverside faces the Thames Path and Hampton Court Palace Gardens and golf course in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

His father had a warehouse and warping mill in the village and contracted work out to local weavers. However, both Joseph's parents died of tuberculosis when he was 7, and his grandfather, also Joseph Livesey, and uncle, Thomas Livesey, stepped in to run the business and look after the boy; they were not successful and the business had to be wound up after 3–4 years. The family became weavers instead, practising their trade in a damp cellar, prone to flooding due to the nearby River Ribble. Shortly afterwards, his grandfather died and young Joseph had to take on the domestic duties as well. The hardships of his early life continued until after his marriage in 1815 to Jane Williams, when he moved to Preston and abandoned the trade of weaving for the business of cheese selling. He successfully continued this trade in Preston until his death.\n\n was said to be hanging off on its hinges. The church had been founded in 1692 and was dedicated to St. Andrew. Ranulph do Glanville, the famous justiciary of England during the reign of Henry II, was born in Stratford St Andrew. The village sign for Stratford St Andrew shows the mill, of which little now remains. Whilst the black swan, which can be seen on the sign, is a reminder of a coaching inn, named the 'Black Swan'. This inn no longer exists. The coat of arms for the village reads: This translates as 'doing rightly, be confident.'\n\n He was born at Astley, just south of the town of Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire, and was from a yeoman family. He was apprenticed to a linen draper in Worcester circa 1632, but left after a few years to live a country life. According to John Aubrey he died violently; 'The cause of death was a beating and thrown into a tub of water'.\n\n Mills was born in Hampstead Garden Suburb, the son of British Army Colonel Kenneth Mills. Mills' brother is lawyer David Mills, who was married to Dame Tessa Jowell, a former Labour Cabinet minister. Educated at Glenalmond College in Scotland, Mills then read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, Oxford. Searching for extra income as a student, he started selling household cleaning goods door-to-door, and in 1958 hired a plane to fly fellow students to Canada for summer jobs, making a profit by selling off the seats, while also selling household cleaning products door to door.\n\n Tom Mills was born on 2 April 1908 at Charters Towers, Queensland. He was the son of a mining engineer, Thomas Mills, and Hettie Mary (née Millican). From 1919 Mills attended Newington College as a boarding student. He rowed in the 1st IV at the GPS Head of the River in 1924 and 1925 and played rugby union in the 1st XV in his final year at school, 1925. Following school, Mills undertook compulsory military training and spent time as a woolclasser. During the Depression he became a tinminer in Emmaville, New South Wales. In 1933, he joined the Militia and as a member of the 12th Light Horse Regiment he was commissioned as a lieutenant two years later.\n\nQuestion: Which is the body of water near George Mills' place of birth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope. Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The \n\n Until the work of Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), a German astronomer, the prevailing belief was that the sun and planets orbited the earth. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus had proposed that all the planets orbited in circles around the sun, but his theory did not give very satisfactory predictions and was largely ignored. When Kepler studied his boss Tycho Brahe's observations of Mars's position in the sky on many nights, Kepler realized that Mars's orbit could not be a circle. After years of analysis, Kepler discovered that Mars's orbit was likely to be an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the ellipse's focal points. This, in turn, led to Kepler's discovery that all planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one of the two focal points. This became the first of Kepler's three laws of planetary motion.\n\n In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation. More generally, in the gravitational two-body problem, if the two bodies are bound to each other (that is, the total energy is negative), their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. The orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse, with the other body at the same focus. Keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Thus, in principle, the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse. (However, this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects, which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed.) For elliptical orbits, useful relations involving the eccentricity.\n\n about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of temperatures, masses, and sizes. The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of \"external\" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe.

As a journalist he worked with the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (1895–1906), Nieuws van den Dag (1906–1923), and Haagsche Post (from 1923). In his first book, he was among the first to postulate a spiral structure for the Milky Way galaxy in which he located the solar system on the edge. A street in Dordrecht is named after him.

The remainder of the land bought by the railway company was subdivided into plots; with the railway facilitating communications with the city, Saltsjöbaden soon became a popular suburb for the upper and upper-middle classes who purchased plots and developed them with spacious private houses. The Stockholm Observatory was located in Saltsjöbaden (see Saltsjöbaden Observatory) from 1931 to 2001. It has a 40 inch (102 cm) Grubb reflector and a double refractor telescope. The asteroid 36614 Saltis, discovered there in 2000, was named after a common nickname of the place. The hilltop premises are now a school.

The radio source later became known as Sagittarius A. His observations did not extend quite as far south as we now know to be the Galactic Center. Observations by Jack Piddington and Harry Minnett using the CSIRO radio telescope at Potts Hill Reservoir, in Sydney discovered a discrete and bright \"Sagittarius-Scorpius\" radio source, which after further observation with the 80-foot CSIRO radio telescope at Dover Heights was identified in a letter to Nature as the \n\n a radius no more than 17 light-hours (120 AU). Later observations of the star S14 showed the mass of the object to be about 4.1 million solar masses within a volume with radius no larger than 6.25 light-hours (45 AU) or about 6.7 billion kilometres. S175 passed within a similar distance. For comparison, the Schwarzschild radius is 0.08 AU. They also determined the distance from Earth to the Galactic Center (the rotational center of the Milky Way), which is important in calibrating astronomical distance scales, as 8 parsecs.

He lived at an estate known as 'Eskroy Park' near Bowenfels, and his ownership of a colliery and land sales in Lithgow gave him income that was more reliable than that coming from the ironworks. Premier Joseph Carruthers (a Free Trader) persuaded him to agree to William Sandford Limited contracting to supply all of the New South Wales Government's needs for iron and steel, for a seven year period, in 1905. Most of this steel would be in the form of heavy steel rails for railways. A condition of that contract was that local iron ore, coal and limestone were to be used \n\n In 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation for this. John Pierpont Morgan was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the United States Steel Corporation. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion. The buyout, secretly negotiated by Charles M. Schwab (no relation to Charles R. Schwab), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to \n\n the bargaining process as well as bargaining power as a dynamic entity. Influencing several generations of scholars, Chamberlain's work on bargaining power would become his most significant contribution to the field.

His work on strikes, which was published in two books, Social Responsibility and Strikes (1953) and The Impact of Strikes: Their Social and Economic Costs (1954), was done in collaboration with Jane Metzger Schilling, an assistant in research at the center and a doctoral student in the Department of Economics at Yale who was working on research into invention \n\n Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Abel also won several strong national steel and other metals contracts. He established the union's first strike fund and quickly amassed an $85 million balance. He resumed coordinated bargaining with the major steelmakers and established separate bargaining councils for aluminum and other metals industries. In 1971, record imports of foreign steel led to 108,000 steelworkers being laid off. Although a new national steel contract was reached without a strike the same year, Abel and the USWA executive council realized that the steel industry's tendency to stockpile steel in anticipation of a strike led to a boom-and-bust cycle, which hurt workers. To counteract the cycle, in 1973 Abel negotiated the Experimental Negotiating Agreement (ENA) with \n\n before every contract deadline, the nation's automakers and other steel users began greatly increasing their purchases from abroad. Kleiman negotiated contracts that helped keep several steel companies afloat during the 1980s, when the industry was traumatized by recession and surging imports. He also helped negotiate an affirmative action agreement for the steel and aluminum industries, paving the way to hire more minority workers. The aluminum agreement was upheld in a landmark Supreme Court case, United Steelworkers v. Weber.

Research astronomers, on the other hand, use various band-pass filters for photometry on telescopes, in order to obtain measurements which reveal objects' astrophysical properties, such as stellar classification and placement of a celestial body on its Wien curve. Most astronomical filters work by blocking a specific part of the color spectrum above and below a bandpass, significantly increasing the signal to noise ratio of the interesting wavelengths, and so making the object gain detail and contrast. While the color filters transmit certain colors from the spectrum and are usually used for observation of the planets and the Moon, the polarizing filters work by adjusting the brightness, and are usually used for the Moon. The broad-band and narrow-band filters transmit the wavelengths that are emitted by the nebulae (by the Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms), and are frequently used for reducing the effects of light pollution. Filters have been used in astronomy at least since the solar eclipse of May 12, 1706.\n\n own accurately determined parallax for 61 Cygni in 1838. For this reason, Alpha Centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because Henderson's work was not fully acknowledged at first.

The period was supposedly 20.85 days, with prograde motion.

It contradicted the model of Ptolemy which considered all celestial objects to revolve around the Earth and was consistent with others, such as those of Tycho and Copernicus. In Galileo’s day the prevailing model of the universe was based on the assertion by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy almost 15 centuries earlier that all celestial objects revolve around Earth (see Ptolemaic system). Observation of the phases of Venus was inconsistent with this view but was consistent with the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus’s idea that the solar system is centered on the Sun. Galileo’s observation of the phases of Venus provided the first direct observational evidence for Copernican theory. Observations of transits of Venus across the Sun have played a major role in the history of astronomy in the determination of a more accurate value of the astronomical unit.\n\nQuestion: When was the celestial object that eluded efforts to measure oxygen discovered to be the center of the solar system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Kepler's laws apply only in the limited case of the two-body problem. Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet were the first to call them \"Kepler's laws\". Nearly a century later, Isaac Newton had formulated his three laws of motion. In particular, Newton's second law states that a force F applied to a mass m produces an acceleration a given by the equation F=ma. Newton then posed the question: what must the force be that produces the elliptical orbits seen by Kepler? His answer came in his law of universal gravitation, which states that the force between a mass M and another mass m is given by the formula  where r is the distance between the masses \n\n1) The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. ; 2) A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. ; 3) The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.  The Kepler problem derives its name from Johannes Kepler, who worked as an assistant to the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Brahe took extraordinarily accurate measurements of the motion of the planets of the Solar System.

His first career was in the Colonial Service; he survived imprisonment by the Japanese during the Second World War, when he was stationed in Singapore, to later serve terms as British Resident in Brunei and then Resident Commissioner in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (now Kiribati and Tuvalu) before retiring in 1952. His father Sir William Peel had been Governor of Hong Kong. Peel was elected as a member of the House of Commons at a by-election in 1957. In July 1959, he provoked angry responses from the House when he \n\n Peel was the sixth son of Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet and Ellen Yates. Among his siblings were older brothers, Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, William Yates Peel (an MP who married Lady Jane Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell), Edmund Peel (also an MP), and Jonathan Peel (a soldier, politician and owner of racehorses). Among his sisters was Harriet Peel (who married Robert Henley, 2nd Baron Henley) and Mary Peel (who married politician George Robert Dawson). His father was a wealthy industrialist and one of early textile manufacturers who sat in the House of Commons representing Tamworth as a 'Church and King' Tory and a staunch supporter of William Pitt the Younger. His grandfather, Robert Peel, and great-grandfather, William Peel, were both yeomen. Peel was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford where he became close friends with the Lord Holland's son, Henry Edward Fox.\n\n promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the Anglican Church and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth. They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing. This viewpoint would later be called Tory democracy. However, since Burke, there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class. In 1834, Tory Prime Minister Robert Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from High Tory reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\".

Mary Griffin, second daughter of the 2nd Baron Braybrooke. His father died on 5 March 1815, aged 35, and so at the age of seven Stephen inherited both the baronetcy and the family estates, including Hawarden Castle in Flintshire. He was educated at Eton, where he displayed a \"singular indisposition to mix or associate even with his school fellows\", although his intellect and prodigious memory were remarked on. He went on to study at Christ Church, Oxford, but was too indolent to flourish, and graduated with a third class degree in Classics. In 1839 his sister Catherine married William Ewart Gladstone. Gladstone's father, Sir John Gladstone, helped rescue Glynne from near bankruptcy after the failure of Oak Farm brick and iron works near Stourbridge, of which Glynne was part-owner. He was able to resume occupancy of Hawarden only by selling part of the estate, and agreeing to share the castle with William and Catherine.\n\n The elder brother of the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, he was born in Liverpool, the eldest son (and second child) of the wealthy Scottish businessman Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet and his second wife Anne MacKenzie Robertson. He was educated at Eton College from 1817. Tom hated Eton, its discipline harsh and irreligious. Disliking the narrow curriculum of classics, he could not translate Latin very well. He found the Dame impossible and the Headmaster had a reputation for flogging, so he asked his father, Sir John, if he could leave the school. His father refused, and this led to yet another beating. He was still \n\n Gladstone was born on 14 July 1885. His father, William Henry Gladstone (1840&ndash;1891), was the eldest son of the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and his wife Catherine, and his mother was the Hon. Gertrude Gladstone, daughter of Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre. He inherited from his father the 18th-century Hawarden Castle which had belonged to the family of his grandmother's brother Sir Stephen Glynne, the 9th and last baronet. He was educated at home before attending Eton and then New College, Oxford. He was president of the Oxford Union in 1907 and graduated with a second class degree.\n\n Hamilton was the eldest son of Walter Kerr Hamilton (1808–1869), Bishop of Salisbury, and was educated at Eton from 1860 to 1865. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 20 January 1866, where he took a Class III in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin), and received a B.Mus. in 1867. He entered the Treasury in 1870, and was private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Robert Lowe, 1872-73. In that year he was appointed private secretary to William Ewart Gladstone who was Prime Minister until 1874, and also served as such 1880-85 when Gladstone was Prime Minister for the second time. Following Gladstone's defeat in 1885 he was appointed by the new Prime Minister, the Tory Lord Salisbury to \n\n He was the fourth child of Sir John Gladstone, a Scottish-born businessman who settled in Liverpool and made a large fortune initially from trading in corn with the United States and cotton with Brazil, and later through sugar plantations in Jamaica.

Representatives from the Police Federation, the Superintendents' Association, ACPO and UNISON worked with the Home Office to create the College, ensuring that it represents the police service's desires and aspirations. As soon as Parliamentary time allows, the College of Policing will be established as a statutory body, independent of government. While the necessary legislation is prepared, the College has been established as a company limited by guarantee. The college officially launched on 4 February 2013 with former chief constable of Hampshire, Alex Marshall as chief executive officer. Marshall retired from policing \n\n The Peelian principles summarise the ideas that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The approach expressed in these principles is commonly known as policing by consent in the United Kingdom and other countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. \"Policing by consent\" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.\n\n After 1815, there was widespread fear of growing crimes, burglaries, mob action, and threats of large-scale disorder. Crime had been handled on an ad-hoc basis by poorly organized local parish constables and private watchmen, supported by very stiff penalties, including hundreds of causes for execution or deportation to Australia. London, with 1.5 million people—more than the next 15 cities combined—over the decades had worked out informal arrangements to develop a uniform policing system in its many boroughs. The Metropolitan Police Act 1829, championed by Home Secretary Robert Peel, was not so much a startling innovation, as a systemization with expanded funding of established informal practices. It created the Metropolitan Police Service, headquartered at Scotland Yard. London now had the world's first modern police force. The 3000 policemen were called \"bobbies\" (after Peel's first name). They were well-organized, centrally directed, and wore standard blue uniforms. Legally they had \n\n Superintendent John May (1775&ndash;1855) was the first commander of the Metropolitan Police \"A\" Division, which policed the Whitehall area of London. Since the divisional station house was adjacent to the offices of the Joint Commissioners, Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, May began to serve as unofficial second-in-command of the force, providing a link between the Commissioners and their men. It was he who interviewed the first candidates for the force, sifting them before Rowan and Mayne made their final selection. Before joining the police, May was a sergeant major in the Grenadier Guards. He was the father of Edmund George May (1821?&ndash;1880) and Charles May. The latter also initially served in the Metropolitan Police, but made his name as the head of the police in Hong Kong.\n\n affairs. The concept of professional policing was taken up by Robert Peel when he became Home Secretary in 1822, emphasising a rigorous and less discretionary approach to law enforcement. Peel's Metropolitan Police Act 1829 established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the Greater London area, known as the Metropolitan Police. The Peelian principles describe the philosophy that Sir Robert Peel developed to define an ethical police force. The principles traditionally ascribed to Peel state that: The Metropolitan Police officers were often referred to as ‘Bobbies’ after Sir Robert (Bobby) Peel, and are regarded as the first modern police force.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of the person who came up with the concept of the \"new\" police?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Previously he had served as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2000 and Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2000. During the 1990s he worked in President Boris Yeltsin's administration in different positions before joining President Vladimir Putin's first administration. Since leaving the government over disagreements on economic policy, he has become one of the leading critics of President Putin and an opposition leader. In 2008, Kasyanov was a candidate in the election of President of Russia but in the middle of the campaign was denied participation on political grounds. In 2010, he co-founded the coalition For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption People's Freedom Party \"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\" and became one of the leaders of the People's Freedom Party. He was an active speaker during the 2011–2013 Russian protests for fair elections. Since 2015, he has served as the leader of the political party People's Freedom Party (PARNAS). In 2005–2007, he was one of the leaders of the opposition coalition The Other Russia and democratic protest movement.\n\n Left, SPD and Greens nominated Bodo Ramelow as candidate, as stated in the agreement reached with the CDU. Two days before the election of the Minister President, the AfD declared that its parliamentary group leader Björn Höcke would run against Ramelow. According to its parliamentary faction leader Torben Braga, the intention is to reveal the voting behaviour of the CDU and FDP, because if Ramelow \"should receive more than the 42 votes of the red-red-green camp and be elected as Minister President, it should be clear to every observer that these votes did not come from the AfD. The CDU and FDP would have thus \"broken their promise not to elect Ramelow and not to allow a continuation of the red-red-green coalition.\" The FDP faction announced it would boycott the election to make it clear that they reject both candidates (Ramelow and Höcke). On the morning of the election, Ramelow declared that he had asked the CDU faction to abstain from voting, as it made no sense \"to burn CDU members of parliament in the first ballot with Höcke's candidacy and the irresponsible disappearance of the FDP.\" A simple majority would therefore suffice in the third round of voting.\n\n The coalition was formed in August 2020, and was initially composed of two alliances Democratic Front, Popular Movement and Socialist People's Party, which is not part of any alliances. The main goal of the coalition is to overthrow the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of President Milo Đukanović, which has been in power since its founding in 1991. All coalition member parties employed a more significant cultural and socially conservative discourse, due to 2020 Montenegrin political crisis and the open conflict between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the DPS-led Montenegrin government, following the adoption of the disputed law on the status of religious communities in Montenegro, supporting 2019-2020 clerical protests in Montenegro and Serbian Orthodox Church rights in Montenegro. Many media, analysts, but also political opponents have labeled the new coalition as the \"Vučić's list\", because major parties in the new coalition have very close cooperation with the populist SNS-led regime in Serbia, the largest number of constituents of the new coalition were present at several meetings in Belgrade during 2019 and 2020, organized by Serbian President (also the SNS chairman) Aleksandar Vučić, gathering \"leaders of Serb communities\" in Serbia's neighboring countries.\n\n Evangelical Church in Germany. The party's success, however, was very limited on the federal and state levels of government because it never reached the \"5% hurdle\" of votes cast necessary to get into the parliaments in Germany's system of proportional representation. In the last federal election the PBC participated (2013), the party achieved 0.0 percent of votes. p By contrast, the conservative Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union of Bavaria are powerful political forces in Germany (based on the number of votes and offices held). They differ greatly from the former PBC though in accepting secularization and being traditionally close to the Evangelical Church in Germany and the Roman Catholic Church. The party was a member of the European Christian Political Movement (EPCM).\n\n The Party of Bible-abiding Christians (Partei Bibeltreuer Christen, PBC) was a conservative evangelical minor right-wing political party in Germany. It was founded in 1989 during a convent of the Federation of Pentecostal Churches (Germany) to serve as political arm of the christian right in germany. It was against same-sex marriage and legality of abortion. It supported a reference to God in the European Constitution and it strongly supported Israel. In March 2015, the PBC merged with the Party for Labour, Environment and Family (AUF) into the Alliance C – Christians for Germany.

The works were constructed in 1913 and pumped 7.5 e6impgal per day of treated Rivelin water to the Hadfield service reservoir at Crookesmoor to supply the City of Sheffield. Further improvements in 1946 increased the flow to Hadfield reservoir to 12 e6impgal per day. The works also pump Rivelin water up to the Redmires water main against a head of 400 ft. In 2008 the Civil engineering company J.N. Bentley installed a 120 kW turbine at the inlet of the works to generate renewable energy; this energy is then used at the works. In December 2015 work started on a £24 million project to upgrade the treatment works.

It then flows into Chew Brook which is a tributary of the River Tame, which feeds the River Mersey. The Ashton under Lyne, Stalybridge and Dukinfield Waterworks Joint Committee's reservoir scheme began in the Greenfield Valley in 1870. Yeoman Hey Reservoir was completed in 1880 (capacity of 780 million litres and 20m deep). Greenfield Reservoir was built from 1897 to 1902. It is the smallest of the reservoirs (capacity of 464 million litres and 20m deep). Dovestone Reservoir is the largest of the three reservoirs in the valley. It has a capacity of 4887 million litres and is up to 31m deep.

A 40 ft lower-gravity \"cushion\" dam is located 370 ft downstream from the main dam, creating a pool of water that protects the riverbed. The pool's effectiveness is enhanced by a deflection unit at the base of the main dam. Calderwood's powerhouse is located 1.2 mi downstream from the dam, on the opposite side of the horseshoe bend in the river. A submerged intake just upstream from the dam diverts water into a 2150 ft concrete tunnel, which carries the water to the other side of the peninsula, where it spills down three penstocks to a valvehouse.

It is situated in the north Pennines of the United Kingdom, and lies 3.5 km north of the village of Wolsingham, in Weardale, County Durham. The earthen embankment dam, which impounds the reservoir, is recognized as the location where pressure grouting with cement grout was first utilized in 1876 by engineer Thomas Hawksley, to reduce leakage within the rock foundation under an earth dam. Pressure grouting has since become normal practice for construction and remediation at dams and related water resource projects.\n\n The Great Stone Dam (also called the Lawrence Dam or Lawrence Great Dam) was built between 1845 and 1848 on the site of Bodwell's Falls on the Merrimack River in what became Lawrence, Massachusetts.

He worked for twenty years with Marcel-Paul Schützenberger on properties of the symmetric group. They wrote many articles together and had a major impact on the development of algebraic combinatorics. They succeeded in giving a combinatorial understanding of various algebraic and geometric questions in representation theory. Thus they introduced many new objects related to both fields like Schubert polynomials and Grothendieck polynomials. They were also the first to define the crystal graph structure on Young tableaux (though not under this name).

The memo grew into a magazine article, and he intended to incorporate elements of the article into a book much larger than The Road to Serfdom. However, he ultimately decided to write The Road to Serfdom as its own book. The book was originally published for a British audience by Routledge Press in March 1944 in the United Kingdom. The book was subsequently rejected by three publishers in \n\n on certain rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez-faire capitalism\". In the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system (a view that he later withdrew), work-hours regulation, social welfare, and institutions for the flow of proper information. Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek's works, Block asserts that: \"in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed\".\n\n Although they shared most political beliefs, disagreeing primarily on question of monetary policy, Hayek and Friedman worked in separate university departments with different research interests and never developed a close working relationship. According to Alan O. Ebenstein, who wrote biographies of both of them, Hayek probably had a closer friendship with Keynes than with Friedman. Hayek received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1954. Another influential political philosopher and German-speaking exile at the University of Chicago at the time was Leo Strauss, but according to his student Joseph Cropsey who also knew Hayek, there was no contact between the two of them. \n\n the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual. Initially written as a response to the report written by William Beveridge, the Liberal politician and dean of the London School of Economics where Hayek worked at the time, the book made a significant impact on 20th-century political discourse, especially American conservative and libertarian economic and political debate, being often cited today by commentators. Subject to much attention, the ideas advocated in The Road to Serfdom have been criticized and defended by many academics since the book was published.\n\n largely from the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially \"fascinated the academic world\" and appeared to offer a less \"facile and superficial\" understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school's. Also in 1931, Hayek crititicized John Maynard Keynes's Treatise on Money (1930) in his \"Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J.M. Keynes\" and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as Prices and Production.

Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and Böhm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard. Austrian economist Walter Block says that the Austrian School can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories—economic theory and political theory. According to Block, while Hayek can be considered an Austrian economist, his views on political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which Block sees as an integral part of the Austrian School.

In it, Mises stated that praxeology could be used to deduce a priori theoretical economic truths and that deductive economic thought experiments could yield conclusions which follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions. He wrote that conclusions could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis and argued against the use of probabilities in economic models. Since Mises' time, some Austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach while others have adopted alternative methodologies. For example, Fritz Machlup, Friedrich Hayek and others did not take Mises' strong a priori approach to economics.

Initially sympathetic to Wieser's democratic socialism he found Marxism rigid and unattractive, and his mild socialist phase lasted until he was about 23. Hayek's economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the classical liberalism of Carl Menger after reading von Mises' book Socialism. It was sometime after reading Socialism that Hayek began attending von Mises' private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including Fritz Machlup, Alfred Schutz, Felix Kaufmann and Gottfried Haberler, who were also participating in Hayek's own more general and private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher Eric Voegelin, with whom he retained a long-standing relationship.\n\n Human Action: A Treatise on Economics is a work by the Austrian economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises. Widely considered Mises' magnum opus, it presents the case for laissez-faire capitalism based on praxeology, his method to understand the structure of human decision-making. It rejects positivism within economics. It defends an a priori epistemology and underpins praxeology with a foundation of methodological individualism and laws of apodictic certainty. Mises argues that the free-market economy not only outdistances any government-planned system, but ultimately serves as the foundation of civilization itself. Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens is the 1940 German-language predecessor to Human Action.\n\nQuestion: Who did Hayek work for after being hired by the author of Human Action?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system (a view that he later withdrew), work-hours regulation, social welfare, and institutions for the flow of proper information. Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek's works, Block asserts that: \"in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed\".\n\n Writing in the era of the Great Depression, the rise of autocracies in Russia, Italy and Germany, and World War II, Hayek wrote a memo to the director of the London School of Economics, William Beveridge, in the early 1930s to dispute the then-popular claim that fascism represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system. The memo grew into a magazine article, and he intended to incorporate elements of the article into a book much larger than The Road to Serfdom. However, he ultimately decided to write The Road to Serfdom as its own book. The book was originally published for a British audience by Routledge Press in March 1944 in the United Kingdom. The book was subsequently rejected by three publishers in \n\n the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual. Initially written as a response to the report written by William Beveridge, the Liberal politician and dean of the London School of Economics where Hayek worked at the time, the book made a significant impact on 20th-century political discourse, especially American conservative and libertarian economic and political debate, being often cited today by commentators. Subject to much attention, the ideas advocated in The Road to Serfdom have been criticized and defended by many academics since the book was published.\n\nQuestion: Who did Hayek work for upon being hired by the author of Bureaucracy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The campaign ended in an Allied victory. It is one of the large-scale battles of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located in the border area between Yunnan Province, China and northern Myanmar, starting at the beginning of December 1943. The purpose of the battle is to open up the China-India Highway. At the end of March 1945, the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the British Army, and the Merrill's Marauders joined forces in Muse, Burma (Myanmar), while the Japanese Army lost the North Burma Stronghold. The Allied Forces were jointly formed by the troops of China, the United States and the United Kingdom.

He was a native of Pingyuan County, Guangdong. Zeng served the Nationalist government as Mayor of Guangzhou from 1936 to 1938. He later led the Ministry of Transportation and Communications from 1942 to 1945. Upon graduation from Peiyang University in 1923, Zeng enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh. Upon his return to China in 1925, Zeng was named to the Kuomintang Central Committee and a political operative of the National Revolutionary Army. Zeng also served as deputy minister of the Agriculture and Mineral Resources. As director of the Zhejiang Provincial Infrastructure Department, Zeng oversaw several construction projects including the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Qiantang River Bridge. In 1935, Zeng became a member of several government committees on infrastructure. He assumed the mayoralty of Guangzhou between 1936 and 1938, before taking office as transportation and communications minister in 1942. After resigning the office in 1945 due to health reasons, Zeng was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1948. The next year, he left China for Hong Kong, where he died in 1969.\n\n The continuing stalemate around Wuhan and the continued influx of foreign aid to Chinese forces from ports in the south made the IJA decide to deploy three reserve divisions to pressure the naval shipping lines. It thus decided to occupy the Guangdong port by an amphibious landing. Because of the fighting in Wuhan, a significant portion of Chinese forces in Guangzhou had been transferred elsewhere. As such, the pace of the occupation was much smoother than expected, and Guangzhou fell to the Japanese on 21 October. The loss of the Guangzhou area meant the loss of the main supply line of foreign aid to central China -- the two railways linking Kowloon to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Wuhan. Thus, the strategic value of Wuhan was greatly diminished. The Chinese Army, hoping to save its remaining forces, thus abandoned the city on 25 October. The Japanese Army captured Wuchang and Hankou on 26 October and captured Hanyang on the 27th, which concluded the campaign in Wuhan.\n\nQuestion: what year did the Japanese get to city where Wang Yue died and the rest of Guangdong province?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely. Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the North China Plain. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, Wuzhou is about 120 mi upstream from Guangzhou, but the Yue variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of Taishan, 60 mi southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers. In parts of Fujian the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible. Until the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken. The vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America up to the mid-20th century spoke the Taishan dialect, from a small coastal area southwest of Guangzhou.\n\n Historically, Chinese agricultural settlement in the area was made possible by the Shiyang River, flowing from the Qilian Mountains. However, the livelihood of Chinese farmers here was often precarious; in the 1920s it was considered as somewhat of a regular famine district. Large number of Zhenfan people, nicknamed \"Sand-hollow Mice\", worked as \"camel-pullers\" with caravans owned by Mongols from the adjacent Alashan, or moved—temporarily or permanently—to Xinjiang. For example, as of 1926, the main population of the small oasis of Santanghu (now, officially, Santanghu (三塘湖乡) in what's today Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County of Xinjiang were migrants from Minqin (Zhenfan) and their descendants. By the late 20th century, the environmental situation in the Minqin area deteriorated, as smaller amounts of the Shiyang River water reached the area, due to the increased irrigation of use of it upstream. Ground water levels fell, and desertification became a serious threat. Minqin is now identified as one of the major sources of sandstorms in China.\n\n arrest Ye, but Ye was able to flee.

When Wang Xi then sent the generals Pan Shikui (潘師逵) and Wu Xingzhen (吳行真) to attack Jian, Wang Yanzheng sought aid from Min's northern neighbor Wuyue. Wuyue's king Qian Yuanguan sent a detachment commanded by Yang Renquan and Xue Wanzhong (薛萬忠) to aid Wang Yanzheng, but Wang Yanzheng defeated Pan and Wu before the Wuyue army's arrival.

Civil war erupted in Min during the reign of Wang Yanxi. His brother Wang Yanzheng launched a rebellion in 943 and established Yin. The Southern Tang failed to mediate between the Wang Brothers and prepared to invade their territories. In 944 the upstart Zhu Wenjin executed Wang Yanxi. A revolt incited by Wang Yanzheng deposed Zhu in February 945, reuniting Min and Yin shortly before the impending attack by Li Jing. The defending Min forces were led into an engagement by Yang Sigong that ended in disastrous rout. Southern Tang armies soon encircled Jianzhou. Outside help wasn't forthcoming and the trapped Wang Yanzheng surrendered in October 945. Initially the Southern Tang appeared to have successfully incorporated Min within their empire. This situation quickly changed after Chen Jue instigated the Battle of Fuzhou with Li Renda. The besieged port city received Wuyue relief forces which in 947 forced the Southern Tang to withdraw. The former Min kingdom became partitioned as the Wuyue secured their gains around Fuzhou.\n\n Fire from the soldiers at Meicheng (then romanized \"Min-tsing\" from its role as the seat of Minqing County) turned back an expedition by Karl Gützlaff and Edwin Stevens to explore and evangelize in Fujian's tea country in 1835.\n\nQuestion: Who led the military expedition to where now Min dialects are spoken on border with Zhejiang?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It had been claimed that she was born into a banner family named Gu and took on Manchu identity after her marriage to Yihui 奕会 (1799-1838), a Manchu prince. Other scholars claim that the confusion about her identity is an attempt to obscure her family's descent from E-er-tai, a Manchu grand secretary disgraced (and forced to commit suicide) during one of Qianlong's literary inquisitions.

Descendants of the Ming continued to hang on in the south, and Youlang ascended the throne as the fourth Southern Ming emperor, with the reign-title Yongli in November 1646.

King of Chakla had to appeal for China's help. However, Mu Zeng promised to Chinese that he would offer soldiers in Ming–Manchu War. It was a successful diplomatic effort, Ming China did nothing but send an envoy to Lijiang to call for a cease-fire. After Manchu conquest of China, chieftain Mu Yi (木懿) swore allegiance to Manchu Qing dynasty. In 1673, Wu Sangui revolted against Qing dynasty. Mu Yi rejected to swear allegiance to Wu Sangui, and was thrown into prison. Mu Yi was released after the rebellion was put down, and restored. The Chiefdom of Lijiang was abolished by Yongzheng Emperor in 1723. Since then, the magistrates of Lijiang were all Han Chinese; they were appointed by Chinese emperor directly.

At the same time, Ming armies were occupied in the defence of the northern border against the Manchu ruler Hong Taiji, whose father, Nurhaci, had united the Manchu tribes into a cohesive force. In 1636, after years of campaigns against Ming fortifications north of the Great Wall, Huangtaiji declared himself emperor of the Qing dynasty.

Taking over command after his uncles death, Qing commander Sengge Rinchen pursued Zhang's forces to the city of Caozhou, Shandong. However Senge Rinchen was killed in early 1865, allowing Nian troops to retreat to northern Anhui. In October 1866 Zhang returned to Shandong with reinforcements, among them former Taiping rebels. At this point the Nian army became a full-name army. The Nian domains were split into the Eastern Nian, led by former Taiping King Lai Wenguang and Western Nian, led by Zhang Zongyu.

His army attacked the coastal region and seized much of the territory. However, it was said that he himself was young, lacking experience and strategy. He took reports from his generals but had little direction for them. Liu Bin reacted by sending his brothers Liu Hongchang, Prince of Yue, and Liu Honggao, the Prince of Xun, to command an army against Zhang. However, Zhang's army surrounded and defeated them. Only through the efforts of the officer Chen Daoxiang (陳道庠) were the two princes able to escape. Most of Southern Han's eastern prefectures fell to Zhang, including Xun.

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nPlot\n\nRetired Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe neurotrauma, concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Dr. Steven DeKosky and county coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. Soon after, Strzelczyk dies in a car accident.\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk (2004) and two additional deceased NFL players, Terry Long (2005), and Andre Waters (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\nCast\n\n Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu\n Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes\n Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht\n Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso\n David Morse as Mike Webster\n Ben McDonnell as young Mike Webster\n Arliss Howard as Dr. Joseph Maroon\n Mike O'Malley as Daniel Sullivan\n Eddie Marsan as Dr. Steven T.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas.\n\nWill Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast.\n\nIt received $14.3 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Other area scenes were shot at a church in Pittsburgh's Hill District, the Braddock Carnegie Library, and in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\".\n\nRelease\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games.\n\nConcussion was released on Digital HD on March 15, 2016, before being released two weeks later on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\nConcussion grossed $34.5 million in North America and $14.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $48.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film opened on December 25, 2015 alongside Daddy's Home, Joy, Point Break and the nationwide expansion of The Big Short. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. It eventually grossed $10.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office. Due to Smith's star status and the $35 million production budget, the film was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWill Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized.\n\nAccolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a \"quack\" in addition to telling him \"to go back to Africa\" and \"get away from our game.\" In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". When asked about the accuracy of the film, CTE researcher Steven DeKosky also noted that it took numerous liberties.\n \nSlate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. \"[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries,\" he charges. In particular, he cites a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMore recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE. For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity. These CTE symptoms include cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems.\n\nAfter comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue. The New York Times discovered emails directly referencing removing \"unflattering moments for the NFL” and removing “most of the bite” out of the film “for legal reasons with the NFL\". Landesman stated the changes were made \"to portray the characters and story as accurately as possible to reduce the chance that the league could attack the filmmakers for taking too much creative license\".\n\nSee also\n League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\n Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis\n Concussions in American football\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n2015 films\n2015 biographical drama films\n2010s sports drama films\n2015 thriller drama films\nAfrican-American biographical dramas\nAmerican films\nAmerican biographical drama films\nAmerican sports drama films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nEnglish-language films\nBiographical films about sportspeople\nDrama films based on actual events\nFilms about diseases\nFilms about suicide\nFilms based on newspaper and magazine articles\nFilms set in 2002\nFilms set in 2005\nFilms set in California\nFilms set in New York City\nFilms set in Pittsburgh\nFilms set in Washington, D.C.\nFilms shot in Pennsylvania\nFilms shot in Pittsburgh\nFilms with screenplays by Peter Landesman\nSports films based on actual events\nVillage Roadshow Pictures films\nColumbia Pictures films\nFilms scored by James Newton Howard\nFilms directed by Peter Landesman\nCultural depictions of players of American football\nCultural depictions of American men\n2015 drama films\n\nConcussion is a 2015 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the exposé \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published in 2009 by GQ magazine.

It stars Norwegian actor Christopher Rygh as the title character, Cora Kaufman, and Aisha Ricketts. The film centers on the title character, who works as a bounty hunter for a local kingdom, all the while he awaits the eventual return of the creature responsible for the murder of his daughter. Influenced by Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1981 film Quest for Fire, as well as The X-Files, and Tales From the Crypt television series, The Head Hunter was developed by Downey and Kevin Stewart, with the location in mind long before the film's story was eventually developed.

Smith's directorial debut, the short film Cargese, was aired on Sky Arts in May 2013. Smith had a supporting role as the embodiment of Skynet in Terminator Genisys (2015);  he was set to have more screen time in the sixth and seventh films in the series. On 20 November 2014, it was announced that Smith would star in the action-thriller film Patient Zero. In January 2019, he joined Sony's Spider-Man spin-off Morbius. In February, it was announced that he had joined the cast of Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho.\n\n Following the departure of Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes during the ninth season, chief content officer Scott Gimple stated that they plan to create three AMC Original Films to explore events related to Rick's character in the future, starring Lincoln, and with the first expected to begin production in 2019. Besides Lincoln, Danai Gurira (Michonne) and Pollyanna McIntosh (Jadis / Anne) will also star in these films. Gimple stated that these will not simply be extended episodes, nor will attempt to adapt any of the comic stories, but will heavily involve Kirkman in their development. The films will be released in theaters by Universal Pictures. The films are expected to follow a group known as the Three Rings, a militaristic force that see themselves as the future of humanity. This is the force whom Jadis was in contact with and who rescued Rick at the end of \"What Comes After\", the group that Michonne sees at the end of \"What We Become\", the group that Isabella is from in the episode \"The End of Everything\" from Fear the Walking Dead, and the teenagers in World Beyond will be from one of the communities set up by the Three Rings.\n\nQuestion: This cast member in \"Search for the Gods\" also plays a character in which film?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was played on 17 May at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. In the final, Borussia Dortmund played Bayern Munich. The winners would have earned a place in the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, but both teams had already qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League via their league positions. Because of this, the three Europa League spots were passed down through league positions. This was the last season in which the cup runners-up would have qualified for the Europa League if the winners had already qualified for the Champions League. The winners also earned the right to play in the 2014 DFL-Supercup; as Bayern had already won the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund became their opponents regardless of the result due to them also finishing as league runners-up. It was Dortmund's sixth final, of which they had won three, including their most recent in 2012 against Bayern. Bayern were the defending champions, and it was their 20th final. Bayern Munich won a record 17th title, after defeating Dortmund 2–0 after extra time.\n\n This was the first time in the history of the Champions League (and European Cup) that the final was contested between two German sides.

West German football clubs have entered European association football competitions since the 1955–56 season, when Rot-Weiss Essen took part in European Cup competition. East German football clubs entered European association football competitions two years later, since the 1957–58 season, when FC Erzgebirge Aue took part in European Cup competition. So far, German clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup eight times (Bayern, Dortmund and Hamburg), the Europa League/UEFA Cup six times (Mönchengladbach, Bayern, Eintracht Frankfurt, Leverkusen, Schalke), the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup five times (Bayern, Bremen, Dortmund, Hamburg, Magdeburg), the UEFA Super Cup twice (Bayern) and the UEFA Intertoto Cup nine times (Karlsruhe, Schalke, Stuttgart, Bremen, Hamburg and Hertha).\n\n After seeing two league championships heading to Dortmund and losing the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final to Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena, Bayern recovered to clinch the 2012–13 Bundesliga in record time, breaking Dortmund's points record which had been set the year before. At the end of that season, the rivals met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The German clubs had eliminated the two Spanish contenders, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, leading to the term \"German Clasico\" term first being used at that time, based on the El Clásico between those two Spanish clubs. The game was also notable for the fact that Dortmund's Mario Götze had already agreed to join Bayern in the coming weeks (although he did not play in the final due to injury). In the first all-German European final, Arjen Robben scored a dramatic 89th-minute winner at Wembley. Bayern would wrap up the first Treble in their history a week later in the 2013 DFB-Pokal Final.\n\n The 2013 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the 58th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 21st season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The match took place on Saturday, 25 May 2013, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, between German Bundesliga clubs Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. In the first all-German Champions League final, Bayern won the match 2–1 with goals from Mario Mandžukić and man of the match Arjen Robben coming either side of an İlkay Gündoğan penalty for Dortmund. One week later, Bayern won the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal and, having already won the 2012–13 Bundesliga, completed the continental treble. As a result of their Champions League win, Bayern qualified to play against Chelsea, the winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, and also earned the right to enter the semi-finals of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative.

He originally trained as a gem-cutter and seal-maker working in Pentonville but moved from this to intaglio work (exhibiting in the Royal Academy from 1841) and then at the suggestion and promotion of poet and friend Alaric Watts he trained as a sculptor at the Royal Academy Schools from 1846. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842 to 1884. From 1861 he has studios at Sloan Street in Chelsea. By 1884 when he retired he was the Bolton's Studios in South Kensington. He died at home, East Dome House in Bognor Regis on 1 April 1886.\n\n  The Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon (1909–1992) painted 28 known large triptychs between 1944 and 1985–86. He began working in the format in the mid-1940s with a number of smaller scale works before graduating to large examples in 1962. He followed the larger style for 30 years, although he painted a number of smaller scale triptychs of friend's heads, and after the death of his former lover George Dyer in 1971, the three acclaimed \"Black Triptychs\". Bacon was a highly mannered artist and often became preoccupied with forms, themes, images and modes of expression that he would rework for sustained periods, often for six or seven-year periods. When asked about his tendency \n\n  Philip Dawe (c.1730 &ndash; 13 August 1832) was an English mezzotint engraver, artist and political cartoonist. He is thought to have been born in London in the 1730s, the son of a city merchant. He died in Kentish Town, London. He was married to Jane and they had six children, three of whom also became artists: George Dawe, Henry Edward Dawe and James Philip Dawe. He was articled to Henry Morland and godfather to his son George Morland. It is said that Dawe was the only person to maintain a strong friendship with George Morland through both the ups and downs of the latter's life. Dawe's son, George, wrote a biography of Morland entitled The Life of George Morland with Remarks on \n\n Three Figures in a Room is a 1964 oil-on-canvas triptych painting by British artist Francis Bacon. Each panel measures 198 xx and shows a separate view of his lover George Dyer, whom Bacon first met in 1963. It is the first of Bacon's works to feature Dyer, a model to whom he returned repeatedly in his paintings. The work has been described as Bacon's first secular triptych. Bacon had been painting triptychs since his in 1944 break-through Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. Three Figures continues the theme of Bacon studying a single subject from different angles. Although painted on three separate canvases, each image occupies the same space, marked by a brown elliptical floor and yellowish walls which continue across the panels. The presence of a single model three times in the same space defies narrative explanation.

It was painted in the first half of 1964, within a year of Bacon first meeting Dyer in late 1963, and was based on photographs of Dyer taken by John Deakin. Bacon painted about 40 triptychs in this small format, with each portrait measuring 11 x.

He famously died of pneumonia contracted while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He served both as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method and pioneer in the scientific revolution. Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments.\n\n Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban, (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626), also known as Lord Verulam, was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution. Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the \n\n had conducted his experiments in precise detail, perhaps with the idea that others could reproduce and independently test his results. About 1256 he joined the Franciscan Order and became subject to the Franciscan statute forbidding Friars from publishing books or pamphlets without specific approval. After the accession of Pope Clement IV in 1265, the Pope granted Bacon a special commission to write to him on scientific matters. In eighteen months he completed three large treatises, the Opus Majus, Opus Minus, and Opus Tertium which he sent to the Pope. William Whewell has called Opus Majus at once the Encyclopaedia and Organon of the 13th century.\n\n may also be because hypothesising plays only a small role in Bacon's method compared to modern science. Hypotheses, in Bacon's method, are supposed to emerge during the process of investigation, with the help of mathematics and logic. Bacon gave a substantial but secondary role to mathematics \"which ought only to give definiteness to natural philosophy, not to generate or give it birth\" (Novum Organum XCVI). An over-emphasis on axiomatic reasoning had rendered previous non-empirical philosophy impotent, in Bacon's view, which was expressed in his Novum Organum: XIX. There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to \n\n the university. Bacon attempted to describe a rational procedure for establishing causation between phenomena based on induction. Bacon's induction was, however, radically different than that employed by the Aristotelians. As Bacon put it, \"[A]nother form of induction must be devised than has hitherto been employed, and it must be used for proving and discovering not first principles (as they are called) only, but also the lesser axioms, and the middle, and indeed all. For the induction which proceeds by simple enumeration is childish. —Novum Organum section CV\" Bacon's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theories. Bacon explains how his method is applied in his Novum Organum (published 1620). \n\nQuestion: Who is the father of the author of Novum Organum?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In his hand, he holds a pencil, an \"emblem\" of the sitter. Instead of going with a customary full-face or strict profile view, Russell chose a three-quarter view in which the sitter turns his head to look out across his shoulder at the viewer, adding a \"new drama\" to the formats of Russell's early portraiture.

In the summer of 1950 as One: Number 31, 1950 was being made, photographer Hans Namuth was invited to take photos documenting Pollock’s studio and work. Upon arrival, Namuth was initially disappointed because Pollock stated the large oil and enamel paint topped canvas was finished; however, this sense of dissatisfaction was short lived as Pollock spontaneously took his paintbrush and began slinging black, white, and brown paint onto the canvas in what Namuth recalled “a dancelike fashion.” This complex mix of \"tans, blues, and grays lashed through with black and white\" of varying luster was the first of the many paintings that Namuth used to bring Pollock’s drip style \n\n French art historian Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake and its companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan as a caricature. In his Self-Portrat, Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo above his head and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand with what appear to be either plants or flowers in the foreground. Curator Philip Conisbee observes the religious symbolism in the images, noting that the \"apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden, temptation, sin, and the Fall of Man.\" Gauguin divides the canvas in half, painting himself as both saint and sinner, reflecting his own personal myth as an artist. In the top portion of the painting, Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo, \n\n One: Number 31, 1950s juxtaposition of subdued colors with splattering of paint on top represents an indispensable example of Abstract Expressionist artwork. Art historian Stephen Policari considered Pollock's poured painting to represent \"a kind of frozen dynamic equilibrium of endless rhythm and energy\" and believed the different combinations of curves and straight lines interacted with each other in a such a way that created a scheme of light and color so complex that it could not be described in the realm of Euclidean geometry. Scholars at the MoMA think Pollock's unparalleled skill was highlighted through the work's interwoven bands of color which they felt contributed an aura of power and fullness to the painting in its entirety while maintaining a sense of elegance and meticulousness in the details. MoMA scholars also emphasize a sense of fundamental order amidst the chaos and endlessness of One: Number 31, 1950 not containing any principle focal points or patterns; this serves as the foundation of interpretations of the painting in which it symbolized \"the pulsing intensity of the modern city, the primal rhythms of nature, and even the infinite depths of the cosmos.\"\n\n Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \"1949 Head\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. But with an inverted pathos is derived from the ambiguity of the pope's horrifying expression—whose distorted face either screams of untethered hatred towards the viewer or pleads for help from the glass cage—the question of what he is screaming about is left to the audience.

She married the consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa, who died in 32 as a victim of Tiberius' reign of terror. Domitia bore Agrippa a son, Quintus Haterius Antoninus (cos. AD 53) in approximately 20. In 33 Domitia married the witty, wealthy, and influential Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. Crispus was the adopted grandson and biological great-great nephew of the historian Sallust. After January 41, Crispus divorced Domitia, so he could marry Domitia's former sister-in-law Agrippina the Younger, who had recently returned from exile. Thereby, Crispus became the stepfather of Agrippina's son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (Nero), who was Domitia's nephew. Crispus soon died mysteriously, leaving a fortune to Agrippina and her son.\n\n Her husband's career in the military began in AD 6, with the Batonian War in Pannonia and Dalmatia. Throughout Germanicus' military career, Agrippina is known to have traveled with her husband and their children. Germanicus' career advanced steadily as he advanced in ranks following the cursus honorum until, in AD 12, he was made consul. The following year, he was given command over Gaul and the forces on the Rhine, totaling eight legions. On 18 May AD 14, her one-year-old son Gaius was sent by Augustus from Rome to join her in Gaul. She was pregnant at the time and, while Germanicus was collecting taxes across Gaul, she remained at an unspecified separate location, presumably for her safety. Augustus sent her a letter with her son's party, which \n\n Agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of Agrippina the Elder and Germanicus. She had three elder brothers, Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, and the future emperor Caligula, and two younger sisters, Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla. Agrippina's two eldest brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus. She was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of Julia the Elder and the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The father of Julia the Elder was the emperor Augustus, \n\n became the new emperor. Being the emperor's sister gave Agrippina some influence. Agrippina and her younger sisters Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla received various honours from their brother, which included but were not limited to  Around the time that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. On December 15, AD 37, in the early morning, in Antium, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the emperor Nero. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius \n\n Agrippina \"the Elder\" (also, in Latin, Agrippina Germanici, \"Germanicus's Agrippina\"; c. 14 BC – AD 33) was a prominent member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

EMU was formed during the second half of the 20th century after historic agreements, such as Treaty of Paris (1951), Maastricht Treaty (1992). In 2002, the euro, a single European currency, was adopted by 12 member states. Currently, the so-called Eurozone has 19 member states. The other members of the European Union are required to adopt the euro as their currency (except for Denmark, which has been given the right to opt out), but there has not been a specific date set. The main independent institution responsible for stability of the euro is the European Central Bank (ECB). Together with 15 national banks it forms the European System of Central Banks. The Governing Board consists of the Executive Committee of the ECB and the governors of individual national banks, and determines the monetary policy, as well as short-term monetary objectives, key interest rates and the extent of monetary reserves.\n\n  The European Central Bank (ECB) is the prime component of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) as well as one of seven institutions of the European Union. It is one of the world's most important central banks. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the Eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU.

It is the flagship ensemble of the IDF and responsible for live musical accompaniment at all national events taking place in the capitals of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. It often performs at official military ceremonies and honor guards in the IDF. It is located in at Aviv Camp in the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. It was established in 1948 out of four orchestras: The Alexandria Division Band, The Jewish Brigade Band, The Artillery Corps Band and The Givati Brigade Band. Its first conductor was Izhak Muse, a Soviet immigrant who played wind instruments. Since the 2000s, the orchestra has performs annually at the Rishon LeZion Festival on Sukkot has become a tradition.\n\n The Israeli Ground Forces (זרוע היבשה) are the ground forces of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The commander is the General Officer Commanding with the rank of Major General, the Mazi, subordinate to the Chief of General Staff. An order from Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion on 26 May 1948 officially set up the Israel Defense Forces as a conscript army formed out of the paramilitary group Haganah, incorporating the militant groups Irgun and Lehi. The Ground Forces have served in all the country's major military operations—including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, 1956 Suez Crisis, 1967 Six-Day War, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1976 Operation Entebbe, 1982 Lebanon War, 1987–1993 First Intifada, 2000–2005 Second Intifada, 2006 Lebanon War, and the Gaza War (2008–09).

Further, Israeli firms had been involved in construction projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s: while preparing the raid, the Israeli army consulted with Solel Boneh, a large Israeli construction firm that had built the terminal where the hostages were held. While planning the military operation, the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the assistance of civilians who had helped build the original. IDF major Muki Betser later remarked in an interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and \"a phenomenal memory\" had provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers.

Before joining the ECB, Elderson has been an executive director of supervision at De Nederlandsche Bank since 1 July 2011, and was ex-officio member of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank. Elderson played a key role in the creation of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) of which he is current chair.\n\n In October 2020, he was proposed by the Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra to succeed to Yves Mersch as executive board member of the European Central Bank. In competition with the Slovenian candidate Boštjan Jazbec, the Eurogroup approved Elderson's nomination. Despite concerns by MEPs over the lack of female members in the ECB's governing council, Elderson's nomination was eventually approved by the European Parliament's ECON Committee and by the plenary chamber of the European Parliament. His appointment was subsequently confirmed by the European Council. In 2020, he was appointed by the Eurogroup as one of the six members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank to succeed Yves Mersch   Elderson is likely to become the Vice-chair of the Supervisory board of the ECB.\n\nChairperson and Committee Member ; 2001: Otmar Issing, Chief Economist of the European Central Bank (ECB) ; 2002–2010: Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the ECB ; 2011–2018: Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of ECB ; 2019– : Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of ECB Secretary and Committee Member ; 2001–2002: Miguel Sebastián Gascón, Professor of Economics at Complutense University of Madrid ; 2003–2016: Juan J.

It can issue decisions to national central banks and may also exercise powers delegated to it by the Governing Council. Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB. The executive board normally meets every Tuesday. It is composed of the President of the Bank (currently Christine Lagarde), the vice-president (currently Luis de Guindos) and four other members. They are all appointed by the European Council for non-renewable terms of eight years.

He also expressed a certain dissatisfaction with the previous album, saying that singing its songs didn't give him the \"melodic goosebumps\", and for this album wanted to write songs that just \"felt really good to sing\". Writing for The Globe and Mail, music critic Brad Wheeler noted the band's stylistic changes, calling Adventures in Your Own Backyard \"a dreamy bath of chamber-pop and fancy cabaret, less clacky without the kitchen-utensil or bike-wheel percussion of Wooden Arms and slightly more grounded than Close to Paradise\". It was also described by another critic as a \"pensive and downtempo affair\", with \"slow-burning melodies [that] take entire songs to ignite memorable hooks\". Thematically, the album was inspired by the concept of home, and especially the \n\n Adventures in Your Own Backyard was recorded almost entirely in a home studio next door to Watson's apartment in the Plateau neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec. The location was chosen for several reasons: the band wanted to return to the city after several years of touring, they felt that they would produce their best work by avoiding the time constraint and stress of recording in a professional studio, and it also allowed Watson to care for his two young children in between recording sessions. According to drummer Robbie Kuster, the relaxed and informal environment \"really let [the band] dig in to the writing and the arranging\" of the album. However, the album's title refers to more than just the physical location of where it was recorded; \n\n The songs of Adventures in Your Own Backyard are described as \"boisterous and pretty, alive and roaming, fairytales with Watson’s skimming falsetto\", and continue in the band's signature style of cinematic and orchestral pop. Like the band's previous release, Wooden Arms, the album contains a few unusual instruments, including a glass marimba on one track, but in general features less of the experimental sound, opting instead for \"an eloquent, perhaps deceptive, simplicity\" and more mature production. According to Watson, the album is much subtler and \"a bit more grounded, less airy... still kind of dreamy but with its feet on the ground\", and he expressed a desire for his audience to focus more on the emotions behind the music than simply on the instruments \n\n Adventures in Your Own Backyard mostly received positive reviews from critics. Olivier Robillard Laveaux of Voir called it \"magnificent\" and \"a success in every way\", while Bernard Perusse of The Gazette called it \"another haunting, atmospheric gem that doesn’t base its resonance on singsong hooks\" and \"somewhat unsettling, often dreamlike, but never predictable and always challenging\". Jian Ghomeshi of the CBC Radio One show Q called it a \"really beautiful record\" and predicted that it would garner the band a lot of attention. However, Dave Simpson of The Guardian gave the album a mixed review, calling it \"pretty stuff, with breathtaking production which doesn't quite conceal a shortage of strong songs\" and saying that the album \"doesn't land enough killer blows\". This opinion was echoed by Chris Bilton of The Grid, who said that though the album contains \"worthy sonic adventures\", few of them are \"memorable enough to get stuck in your head\". The album was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize on June 14, 2012.\n\n Adventures in Your Own Backyard is the fourth studio album by Canadian musician Patrick Watson, released in April 2012. It is the band's follow-up to the Polaris Music Prize-nominated 2009 release Wooden Arms, but by comparison is a musically simpler and more emotional album.\n\nQuestion: What record label does the performer of Adventures in Your Own Backyard belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Islamic rulers called the Iberian peninsula \"Al-Andalus\". For a time, Al-Andalus was one of the great Muslim civilizations, reaching its summit with the Umayyad Caliphate in the 10th century. Al-Andalus had the following chronological phases: (Note: the dates when the different taifa kingdoms were annexed by Almoravids and Almohads vary) The Madrasah of Granada was founded by the Nasrid dynasty monarch Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada in 1349 and housed many of the most greatest prominent scholars of the period.\n\n agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the peninsula. The Umayyad Caliphate collapsed in 1031 due to political divisions and civil unrest during the rule of Hicham II who was ousted because of his indolence. Al-Andalus then broke up into a number of states called taifa kingdoms (Arabic, Muluk al-ṭawā'if; English, Petty kingdoms). The decomposition of the Caliphate into those petty kingdoms weakened the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula vis-à-vis the Christian kingdoms of the north. Some of the taifas, such as that of Seville, were forced to enter into alliances with Christian princes and pay tributes in money to Castille.\n\n were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers. Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east (most notably, al-Ghazali in Persia and al-Turtushi in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from Tortosa), detested the taifa rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a fatwa (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major taifas, with the exception of the one at Saragossa. The \n\n Zuhayr al-Amiri as governor in the city. After the death of the former, the whole territory was annexed in 1038 by Abd-al-Aziz al-Mansur, ruler of Valencia. The taifa of Murcia was conquered by Muhammad ibn Aisha on behalf of the Almoravid Empire in June 1091. As the Almoravid Empire retreated, Abu ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Saʿd ibn Mardanīš (Rey Lobo in Christian chronicles) established a new taifa in the mid-12th century, lasting from 1147 to 1172. During his reign Ibn Mardanis allied with Castile to counter the Almohad expansion. In 1228, Ibn Hud, an Andalusi chieftain, rebelled against the Almohad Empire, entering the city of Murcia on 4 August 1228, establishing a new emirate (the third Taifa \n\n Murcia), ruled by the Banu Hud. By 1240 the taifa was increasingly atomised, with several cities split from the nominal authority of the emir in the city of Murcia, who still claimed authority over the full jurisdiction. Before the triple military threat posed by Castile, Aragon and Granada, the Murcian Emir Muhammad al-Dawla opted to negotiate a treaty with the Castilian King Ferdinand III. After the 1243 Treaty of Alcaraz was reached, the city and the rest of the taifa became a vassal state of the Crown of Castile. As a progressive breach of the conditions abided in the treaty of Alcaraz ensued, discontent increased among the Muslim population, leading to a full-blown insurrection, with the rebels \n\nQuestion: In which year did Taifa of Francisco Giner de los Rios' birthplace cease to exist?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Little is known of his personal life, except that he was born into an Amazigh family. and according to Ibn Sa'id, he was black like his mother. Since some historians have given him the surname al-Ishbili, he may have been born or grown up in Seville. Besides mathematics, he also became famous in literature, law, and particularly in Andalusian poetry.\n\n The collapse of the caliphate and the beginning of the Taifa period, did not have a negative impact on poetic production. In fact, poetry in al-Andalus reached its apex at this time. Ibn Zaydun of Cordoba, author of the, was famously in love with Wallada bint al-Mustakfi, who inspired the poets of al-Andalus as well as those of the Emirate of Sicily, such as Ibn Hamdis. Ibn Sharaf of Qairawan and Ibn Hamdün (1139) became famous in the court of of Almería, while Abū Isḥāq al-Ilbirī and Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun stood out in Granada. Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani was a doctor, mathematician, and philosopher from Cordoba; he is also credited with first bringing Brethren of Purity to al-Andalus.

Cuenca was ruled by the taifa of Toledo—possibly the largest one—whose jurisdiction roughly spanned across the bulk of the Middle March of Al-Andalus. In 1076, Cuenca was besieged by Sancho Ramírez of Aragon, who failed to conquer the place. In 1080 King Yahya al-Qadir of Toledo lost his taifa, and his vizier signed in Cuenca a treaty with Alfonso VI of León and Castile by which he ceded him some fortresses in exchange for military help.

Robert was also an unsuccessful claimant to the throne of the Kingdom of England. The epithet \"Curthose\" had its origins in the Norman French word courtheuse 'short stockings' and was apparently derived from a nickname given to Robert by his father; the chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Orderic Vitalis reported that William the Conqueror had derisively called Robert brevis-ocrea (\"short boot\"). Robert's reign as Duke is noted for the discord with his brothers William II and Henry I in England. Robert mortgaged his duchy to finance his participation in the First Crusade, where he was an important commander. Eventually, his disagreements with Henry I led to defeat in battle and lifelong captivity, with Normandy absorbed as a possession of England.\n\n was in capturing Helias' castle of Bures-en-Bray, at the time garrisoned by Duke Robert's men. During the period from 1104 to 1106, Helias supported Robert Curthose, but in 1106 after the Battle of Tinchebray (in which Robert Curthose was captured and imprisoned by Henry) Helias seems to have been on curiously good terms with Henry I. Secure in his victory, Henry encountered young William Clito, Duke Robert's son, at Falaise. To show he was compassionate, he placed the boy, then about three years old, under the protection of Count Helias. By the time William Clito was seven or eight, he had become the focal point \n\n resistance to Henry I's rule of Normandy and support was growing for William to be Henry's rival for Normandy and perhaps even England. In 1111, Henry I ordered Robert de Beauchamp, Viscount of Arques, to capture his nephew, William Clito, at the castle of Saint-Saens. Helias was absent from the castle at the time, but before the Viscount arrived, the boy was taken out of Normandy to join Helias. The boy and his protector eventually found safe haven at the court of Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders. Meanwhile, Robert de Beauchamp seized the castle of Saint-Saens and held it for Henry I, who then \n\n William was the son of Richard, Count of Évreux, and his wife, Godchildis (Adelaide). William, referred to as Count of Évreux in early 1066, contributed 80 ships towards the planned invasion of England later that year. However, as William did not succeed his father until the year following, this seems to be the lists only anachronism \"as far as Norman names are concerned.\" William is one of the few known companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. For his participation he was rewarded with a modest tenancy-in-chiefdom. However, he was probably not yet of age in 1066 which might have prevented him from taking a more profitable share in England. \n\n The Origine et Historia Brevi Nivernensium Comitum mentions that Renaud II served as co-ruler to his father but predeceased him on 5 August 1089. His death left William I as the only Count of Nevers and William II as his heir apparent. On 20 June 1098, his grandfather died and William II succeeded to the County of Nevers. (William II should not be confused with his paternal uncle William of Nevers, Count of Tonnere). He took part in the Crusade of 1101. He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He arrived in Antioch with only a handful of knights. He persuaded Louis VI to break peace with Henry I and throw his support behind William Clito in 1115. He was imprisoned shortly afterwards by Theobald, Count of Blois. He participated in the Council of Troyes which opened on 14 January 1129 and is known for his support of the Second Crusade.

Her second marriage was also short, ending when Smith saw that her tenant-farmer husband's year-end settlement was grossly short.

Church members therefore consider themselves to be a 'covenant people', specially called or foreordained from 'eternity' (or before earth's creation, which they call 'premortality', or pre-existence).

In October of that year, her father, Joseph Smith Sr., was put in jail due to an unpaid debt, leaving Lucy, Katharine, and their mother Lucy Mack Smith alone in the family's Palmyra home. While he was gone, a mob came in search of Hyrum Smith and began to ransack the house until Lucy's brother William forced the men to leave. In May 1831, nine-year-old Lucy Smith moved with her family to Kirtland, Ohio to join the growing body of Latter Day Saints there.

She was named after her mother. She had eight older siblings: Alvin, Hyrum, Sophronia, Joseph Jr., Samuel, William, Katharine, and Don Carlos. At the time Smith was born, the family was residing in a small log cabin outside of Palmyra, New York, and her brother Joseph Smith was just beginning the Latter Day Saint movement. Young Lucy Smith's life was \"inextricably connected with Restoration events\"; for example, as a young child, she gathered with her family to listen to Joseph Jr. preach about God and the Book of Mormon. She is mentioned as \n\n belief in Universalism contributed to his and some of his children's disdain for revival churches in the 1820s. In 1823, when Smith's older brother Alvin died, the reverend who preached at the funeral implied that Alvin had gone to Hell since he had never been baptized, which angered Smith's father. Joseph Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, was an orthodox Presbyterian, and this differing belief system created tension in the Smith family home. Some of their children followed after their Mother and were baptized into Presbyterianism, while others followed their Father and did not become baptized, including Joseph Smith Jr. Joseph Smith's grandfather Asael Smith remained unmoved in his Universalist convictions upon hearing of Mormonism, but according \n\n Jane McKechnie was born in Edinburgh, the daughter of Jane (Jean Tinto) Bee and John McKechnie.

Jane's mother was taught about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by two Mormon missionaries. She was baptized into the LDS Church on February 21, 1850. Several months later, Jane's grandmother, uncle and aunt also joined the newfound religion. The family moved to the United States by the end of 1850. Her mother worked in and around St. Louis, and remarried to Ira Stearns Hatch, before joining Thomas Howell Wagon Company in 1852. The company traveled 1,100 miles across the American plains, with six-year-old Jane McKechnie walking most of the way barefooted.

The Book of Mormon rejects the doctrine of universal salvation as heretical. The discussions surrounding Universalism in the Book of Mormon are similar to those in early nineteenth century United States. Early converts may have felt their anti-Universalist views confirmed by the Book of Mormon. The anti-Universalism of the Book of Mormon was recognized by its early readers, both adherents and critics. Prominent opponent Alexander Campbell wrote, \"This prophet Smith ... wrote ... in his book of Mormon, every error and almost every truth discussed in N. York for the last ten years. He decides all the great controversies\" and included \"eternal punishment\" as one of those controversies. Early Latter Day Saint Sylvester Smith wrote in 1833 that \n\n The Book of Mormon frequently identifies itself as a record of Joseph's children, with the ancient prophet Lehi (Hebrew לחי Léḥî / Lāḥî \"jawbone\") being an Israelite of the Josephite tribe of Manasseh (Alma 10:3) and the wives of his sons, as the Prophet Joseph Smith later explained, being of the Josephite tribe of Ephraim. In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi lived around 600 BC. He and his family were residents of Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Judah under the reign of King Zedekiah. Lehi also held other property, perhaps outside the city of Jerusalem. Some have suggested that he was \n\n According to the Book of Mormon, the plates of Nephi, consisting of the large plates of Nephi and the small plates of Nephi, are a portion of the collection of inscribed metal plates which make up the record of the Nephites. This record was later abridged by Mormon and inscribed onto gold plates from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon after an angel revealed to him the location where the plates were buried on a hill called Cumorah near the town of Palmyra, New York. Palaeographic study of the plates is not possible; according to Joseph Smith the plates were returned to an angel named Moroni, and are no longer in human possession.\n\n  Latter-day Saints consider The Book of Mormon a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It contains a record of God's dealings with the prophets and ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The introduction to the book asserts that it \"contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon.\" Segments of the Book of Mormon provide an account of the culture, religious teachings and civilizations of groups who immigrated to the New World. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, identified in the \n\n The Book of the Law of the Lord is a sacred book of scripture used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a sect of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is alleged to be a translation by the Strangite prophet James Strang of the brass Plates of Laban, which were originally acquired by Nephi, a leading figure in the early portion of the Book of Mormon. Strang claimed to have translated them using the Urim and Thummim, which Mormons believe was used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates.

Gray, a graduate of Duke University, played Kayama in the 1985 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim's Pacific Overtures. He was the youngest actor to play the title role in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway and in the U.S. national tour, and received The Carbonell Award for his portrayal. Gray played the King of Siam in the 1996 Broadway revival of The King and I, and in the UK touring production. He played Pontius Pilate in the revival of Jesus Christ Superstar and Gaylord Ravenal \n\nMichael Dunn (born Gary Neil Miller, October 20, 1934 – August 30, 1973) was an American actor and singer. He inspired a number of actors significantly smaller and shorter (those with dwarfism) than most people, including Zelda Rubinstein, Eric the Actor, Mark Povinelli, and Ricardo Gil.\n\nMedical condition\nDunn had medical dwarfism, a result of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED, subtype unknown), a genetic defect of cartilage production caused by a mutation in the COL2A1 (type II collagen) gene.  This disorder, classified as a skeletal dysplasia, causes distorted development of the limbs, spine, and ribcage and leads to early, widespread osteoarthritis and constricted lung growth. As an adult, Dunn stood 3' 10\" and weighed about 78 pounds (117 cm, 35 kg). During Dunn's lifetime, his condition was described by the nonspecific term \"progressive chondrodystrophy\", or alternatively as \"achondroplasia\", a term that now refers specifically to a skeletal dysplasia caused by a defect in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.\n\nEarly life\nDunn was born to Jewell (née Hilly; died 1990) and Fred Miller (died 1981) during the time of the Dust Bowl drought. He chose his stage name in order to differentiate himself from another Gary Miller in the Screen Actors Guild. (\"Dunn\" was his maternal grandmother's maiden name, but his reason for choosing \"Michael\" is unknown and not derived from his monastic experience in 1958.) An only child, when he was four years old, his family moved to Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nDunn started reading at age three, was champion of the 1947 Detroit News Spelling Bee—representing Wallaceville School in Wayne County—and showed early skill at the piano. He enjoyed singing from childhood, loved to draw an impromptu audience (even while waiting for a bus), and developed a pleasing lyric baritone and superb sight-reading skills. His parents defied pressure from school authorities to sequester him in a school for disabled children and staunchly supported his talents, independence, and integration into mainstream society. \"I always got thrown out of classes for being too lippy\", he commented about his experience with elementary school teachers. \"I'd read more than they.\" His orthopedic condition greatly limited his mobility, but he swam and ice-skated in childhood and remained a skilled swimmer throughout his life.\n\nEducation\nHe attended Redford High School in Detroit (1947–1951), then entered University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in September 1951, just before his 17th birthday. However, according to his Columbia Studios press kit biography, his studies were interrupted when he was knocked down a flight of stairs during a \"student rush\", which resulted in a three-month hospital stay. \n\nIn 1953, he transferred to the University of Miami, College of Arts and Sciences, which offered a better climate and more accessible campus. His transcript shows that, despite scoring at the 97th percentile of ACE placement exams and the 99th percentile of the CTS English test, he did not distinguish himself academically. However, he was a high spirited and well-known figure about campus who sang in the talent show and facetiously joined the football cheerleading squad. Archives at that university's Otto G. Richter Library show that he became first a copyeditor and a contributing writer, then managing editor in 1954 of the college magazine, Tempo. (Contrary to information that later appeared in his Columbia Studios biography, Dunn could not take credit for Tempo winning the Sigma Delta Chi Award for best college magazine in the country, since credit went to the Editor-in-Chief.) His classmate John Softness recalled, \"He could sing like an angel, and he could act and he could write and he was a brilliant raconteur.\" Softness ran a campus-wide advertising campaign called \"Wheels for Gary,\" which brought in enough money from student donations to buy a used 1951 Austin outfitted with hand controls, so that Dunn could get around independently.\n\nAt various points, he held different odd jobs—singing in a nightclub, answering telephones for the  Miami Daily News, and working as a hotel detective. (\"What a gaff!  I got my room free and all I did was play cards with the night clerk and keep an eye open for any funny business in the lobby. Who would ever suspect me of being a detective?\") He left college in 1956 after completing only his sophomore year, returned to Michigan, and attended summer classes at the University of Detroit, in 1957.\n\nReligion\nDunn converted to Catholicism and was baptized in 1954. He was living in Ann Arbor with his parents, working as a professional singer, at the time he entered St. Bonaventure Monastery in Detroit, on February 25, 1958. According to a Capuchin Provincial Archivist, Dunn entered with the intention of becoming a Capuchin non-ordained Brother. He was known by his given name, Gary, since he never became a novice. A testimonial from John F. Bradley, Catholic Chaplain, University of Michigan, states: \"He has always been interested in Catholic activities and was president of the Newman Club in another school\". In response to a question on the monastery application asking: \"How long have you been thinking of entering religious life?\" Dunn wrote, \"More than three years.\" Dunn was later quoted in the New York Post explaining that he had wanted to be of service, since he was unfit for the military: \"Everyone my age was going to Korea and I had this feeling that singing wasn't exactly doing my part.\" However, monastery records entered by the Master of Novices show that the physical demands of monastic life in a huge, 19th-century building with no elevator proved too strenuous. Dunn left of his own accord on May 8, 1958, in order to pursue a stage career in New York.\n\nCareer\nIn New York, Dunn re-encountered Softness, who volunteered to be his manager. He also befriended actress Phoebe Dorin in an off-Broadway show, Two by Saroyan, in which both had small parts in the early 1960s. They began singing together casually after their nighttime performances, sitting on the wall of the fountain opposite the Plaza Hotel, and drew a following. Eventually, on the advice of fellow actor Roddy McDowall, the pair started a nightclub act of songs mixed with conversational patter, titled \"Michael Dunn and Phoebe\". The act received favorable reviews in Time magazine and The New York Times and ultimately led directly to the pair being cast on The Wild Wild West television series, a Western spy spoof with elements of historical fiction and science fiction, which debuted in 1965.\n\nDunn was probably best known for his recurring role on that series as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a mad scientist who devised passionately perverse schemes and gadgetry to ensnare Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin). (Note: Miguelito is the Spanish diminutive of Michael, equivalent to Mike or Mikey.) Dorin played Dr. Loveless's devoted assistant, Antoinette. In each episode in which they appeared together, the villainous couple tenderly sang a Victorian duet or two, heedless of the mayhem they had created around themselves. According to Dorin, Dunn saved her from drowning during filming of the episode \"The Night of the Murderous Spring\", plunging underwater to tear her free, when her costume became entangled in machinery used to sink a boat on the set. Dunn appeared as Dr Loveless 10 times on The Wild Wild West (four times apiece in the first two seasons and one time apiece in the remaining two seasons). \n\nIn the pilot episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry television spy spoof Get Smart, Dunn showed his skill with comic farce as the well-heeled gangster Mr. Big, leader of international crime organization K.A.O.S. (September 18, 1965). Dunn featured as Alexander, a courageous court jester, in the Star Trek episode \"Plato's Stepchildren\" (November 22, 1968). He also appeared in an episode of Bonanza, \"It's a Small World\" (January 4, 1970), portraying a recently widowed circus performer trying to start a new life, and as a killer clown in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \"The Wax Men\" (5 March 1967).\n\nIn 1963, he received the New York critics' Circle Award for best supporting actor and was nominated for a 1964 Tony Award, for his performance as Cousin Lymon in Edward Albee's stage adaptation of The Ballad of the Sad Café, by Carson McCullers. Dunn received an Oscar nomination and the Laurel Award as the best supporting actor for his role as the cynical Karl Glocken in Ship of Fools (Columbia Pictures, 1965, directed by Stanley Kramer).\n\nIn 1969, The New York Times drama critic Clive Barnes praised Dunn's portrayal of Antaeus in the tragedy The Inner Journey by British novelist and playwright James Hanley, performed at the Lincoln Center: \"Michael Dunn as the dwarf is so good that the play may be worth seeing merely for him. Controlled, with his heart turned inward, his mind a pattern of pain, Mr. Dunn's Antaeus deserves all the praise it can be given.\"\n\nBetween those career highlights, he accepted roles in many pulp horror movies, as well as a role in the 1968 film No Way to Treat a Lady, starring Rod Steiger and George Segal. However, at the time of his death, he was in London playing Birgito in The Abdication (Warner Brothers, 1974, directed by Anthony Harvey), starring Peter Finch and Liv Ullmann. Author Günter Grass had already asked him to play in a film adaptation of his novel, The Tin Drum, a role that ultimately went to the young David Bennent after Dunn's death.\n\nPersonal life\nDunn was married on December 14, 1966, to Joy Talbot. Motion Picture Magazine described her as a model, in a photo caption in the March, 1967 issue. The marriage ended in divorce after a few years. He developed into a dedicated philanthropist toward children with dwarfism who would write fan letters to him confiding their loneliness and despair. According to Dorin, Dunn often traveled to visit such children at his own expense, delivering encouragement to them and stern counsel to overly protective parents.\n\nHis mobility and physical stamina were poor and deteriorated throughout his life. He suffered especially from deformed hip joints (due either to hip dysplasia or coxa vara, with secondary osteoarthritis). However, he scampishly disguised his limitations by telling tall tales that a gullible press eagerly reported as the truth. Various accounts describe him as an aviator, skydiver, judo master, football player, and concert pianist, despite clear evidence on film of a severe, waddling limp, permanently flexed limbs, and gnarled fingers. In published interviews, he did hint at his childhood limitations both in football—\"I was a great passer\"—and in baseball: \"I wasn't a very fast runner. I had to depend on sliding.\" Working in New York, Dunn reportedly accrued masses of parking tickets, since disabled drivers had no special privileges. He also received human transport from friend and stuntman Dean Selmier, who often carried Dunn on his shoulders through the streets of Manhattan.\n\nDeath\nSpinal deformities, including scoliosis, caused a distorted ribcage that restricted Dunn's lung growth and function. The resulting respiratory insufficiency caused overload of the heart's right chambers, a chronic condition called cor pulmonale. He died in his sleep in his room at the Cadogan Hotel in London, on August 30, 1973, at age 38, while on location for The Abdication.\n\nThe New York Times reported his cause of death as undisclosed, leading to decades of repeated public speculation about possible suicide. However, the designation \"undisclosed\" signified merely that no cause of death had yet been determined.  An autopsy was performed on August 31, 1973, by Professor R.D. Teare at St. George's Hospital, London, who noted:  \"The right side of the heart was widely dilated and hypertrophied to twice its normal thickness. The left ventricle was normal in size.\"  He recorded the cause of death as cor pulmonale. This information is confirmed in the \"Report of the Death of an American Citizen\" from the U.S. Department of State, Foreign Service, American Embassy in London, made out on October 12, 1973, by Micaela A. Cella, Vice Consul. The report is on record in the U.S. National Archives in College Park, Maryland.\n\nA London physician reportedly prescribed and administered two narcotics and a barbiturate for severe arthritic pain, despite the extreme risk of inducing respiratory depression, apnea, and death in a patient with decreased respiratory reserve. Dunn may have needed the drugs in order to tolerate the physical demands of shooting a movie. The autopsy's finding of intense vascular congestion in the lungs also suggests the possibility that a rapidly progressive pneumonia may have been developing.\n\nAllegations of chronic alcoholism are unsubstantiated by the autopsy report, which notes only venous congestion of the liver—presumably secondary to Dunn's right-heart failure—without cirrhosis, and without inflammation of the stomach lining or pancreas.  One consequence of such liver dysfunction would be jaundice.  Another would be intoxication after drinking even small amounts of alcohol, as well as a toxic reaction to the prescribed drugs—either of which could also induce altered mental status (such as disorientation, delusions, faulty memory).

The Care Bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. Around the world, many children—and some adults—have teddy bears, stuffed toys in the form of bears, named after the American statesman Theodore Roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree. Bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onward. Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message \"Only you can prevent forest fires\".\n\n Wildfires have a place in many cultures. \"To spread like wildfire\" is a common idiom in English, meaning something that \"quickly affects or becomes known by more and more people\". The Smokey Bear fire prevention campaign has yielded one of the most popular characters in the United States; for many years there was a living Smokey Bear mascot, and it has been commemorated on postage stamps. Wildfire activity has been attributed as a major factor in the development of Ancient Greece. In modern Greece, as in many other regions, it is the most common natural disaster and figures prominently in the social and economic lives of its people. In regards to communicating information to the public regarding wildfire safety, some of the most effective ways to communicate with others about wildfires are community outreach conducted through presentations to homeowners and neighborhood associations, community events such as festivals and county fairs, and youth programs.\n\n carrier and caregiver, she still has time for her family.

When she arrives in his office, she realizes that Alberto is not a prince, and speeds off in embarrassment. Alberto is also confused, thinking Lolita a rich socialite, until he is told by a co-worker that Lolita is merely a secretary at the bank. Distraught, Lolita explains what happened to the bank manager's wife, Doña Mercedes, whom she has been asked to help with an upcoming wedding anniversary party. Mercedes convinces her husband, Don Pedro, to get the couple together, and invite Lolita and Alberto to their wedding anniversary party. Lolita brings Gertrudis, while Alberto is accompanied by Feliciano.

Ruiz is best known for his role as mediator during the conflict between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a Mexican political party which had held power for over seventy years, and whose policies were often disadvantageous to the indigenous populations of Chiapas. Inspired by Liberation Theology, which swept through the Catholic Church in Latin America after the 1960s, Ruiz's diocese helped some hundreds of thousands of indigenous Maya people in Chiapas who were among Mexico's poorest marginalized communities.\n\n Like in the rest of Mexico, Christianity was introduced to the native populations of Chiapas by the Spanish conquistadors. However, Catholic beliefs were mixed with indigenous ones to form what is now called \"traditionalist\" Catholic belief. The Diocese of Chiapas comprises almost the entire state, and centered on San Cristobal de las Casas. It was founded in 1538 by Pope Paul III to evangelize the area with its most famous bishop of that time Bartolomé de las Casas. Evangelization focused on grouping indigenous peoples into communities centered on a church. This bishop not only graciously evangelized the people in their own language, he worked to introduce many of the crafts still practiced \n\n The National Indigenist Institute was established in 1948, with the initial goal of integrating indigenous people into the national culture. The agency carried out health and education campaigns, and it also relocated more than 22,000 people displaced by the construction of the Miguel Alemán Dam in Oaxaca. Three years later, it established the first Indigenous Coordination Center, at San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. In the 1970s, the focus of the agency shifted to \"elevating\" the life of indigenous people to help them participate in the national life, and later to assisting them while protecting their right to preserve their ethnic identity.\n\n By the 1980s, the family moved to Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, a very poor city just outside of Mexico City proper, in the adjoining State of Mexico. Sotero continues the family business here and still works with his mother, and sister Lucia Lemus. The family house, which consists of various small apartments on two floors overlooking a courtyard, is located in the Jose Vicente Villada neighborhood. The workshop is a covered area on the roof. He has worked to improve techniques and designs but still remains based on traditional pieces, especially in the making of toys. Their molds are either from Celaya or have been made by the family to replicate them. The workshop still has molds that are almost 100 years old, collected by \n\n San Cristobal. The mountain city would be founded as Chiapa de los Españoles, while Villa Real de Chiapa would become known Chiapa de los Indios, left to the indigenous and monks there to evangelize them. Despite this, the city would remain one of the most important for the first 200 years of colonization. While it was an encomienda at first, it became a dependency of the Spanish Crown in 1552, changing its name to Pueblo de la Real Corona de Chiapa de Indios. The developers of the area were Dominican friars, who followed the ideals of Bartolomé de las Casas in neighboring San Cristobal.

An informer has given their location to the military, who follow them there. It is revealed that General Moncado and General Sarmiento, who were with the military, are actually allied with El Capo. They escape into the caves and join El Capo's men. The military attacks the caves, and in the battle Chemo is killed. Moncada, Sarmiento and Perrys escape after the raid, with Perrys vowing to take care of El Moro's kids on her own. The military force is ramped up by the President, who is running for re-election.

Permission was received in May 1819, and in September he resigned the command of the army to General José Canterac. He had partisans in Lima, and upon his arrival there they demonstrated in favor of his remaining in Peru to face the threatened invasion of San Martín from Chile. De la Pezuela agreed to promote De la Serna to lieutenant general and name him president of a council of war. San Martin landed in \n\n The existing military grew wary of Chávez due to his relationship with Fidel Castro and the Colombian guerrilla group FARC that they were previously taught \"were the greatest threat to their country\". The military felt that after fighting against Castro's influence, guerilla groups and attempts to overthrow previous Venezuelan governments to expand his revolutionary presence since the 1960s, that they had finally lost when Chávez came to power. Chávez promoted guerilla fighters into the Venezuelan military and forced the wary existing military servicemen to assist them. One of the more controversial actions that created discontent within the military was when Chávez forced them to assist the FARC with setting up camps in Venezuelan territories, providing ammunition to fight the Colombian \n\n out of fear. Generals Pinedo and Izquierdo were ordered to lead the troops to control the demonstration, but they disobeyed and joined the demonstration as leaders instead. The quick reaction was possible because of the active intervention of Encarnación Ezcurra, wife of Rosas. She had a fluent relation with the mentioned caudillos, and suspected that Balcarce may attempt to act against Rosas sooner or later. The movement also secured the arsenals kept at Quilmes, Ensenada and Dolores. The government of Balcarce was left without military power of support.

However, Quirós was determined to continue resisting, the reasons for which are unclear. Quirós had soon \"ignited a caste war\" and quickly gained support among the poor in the region by promising \"no more government interference in Sierran affairs,\" as well as land distribution, guaranteed employment, and \"the termination of Church intrusions.\" The rebellion was \"brushed off\" as \"socialist,\" which was \"used as a catchword by outsiders \n\nQuestion: Before the military coup was staged, who was the president of the country where Fuser and Alberto met the indigenous couple who were traveling to look for work?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The track also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that \"See Your Sunshine\" \"is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her.\" \"You Tell Me\" is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda. \"Mr Bellamy\", the sixth song on the album, was thought by online fans to be about McCartney's then-recent divorce. \n\n Written during Lennon's so-called \"Lost Weekend\" with May Pang, the lyrics depict the pair hanging out with cohorts (including Starr, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon) in Los Angeles. The term \"Goodnight Vienna\" is English slang meaning \"it's all over\", and the slang term \"bohunk\" is a mildly derogatory term for an immigrant of Bohemian descent. This was the second of five Lennon songs to be offered for inclusion on Starr's solo albums, (the others being \"I'm the Greatest\" from Ringo, \"Cookin' (in the Kitchen of Love)\" from Ringo's Rotogravure, and two unreleased songs intended for Stop and Smell the Roses).\n\n Everett suggests the Beatles recorded a rendition of the song only to help promote Kramer's record. The Beatles released their version on the 1994 album Live at the BBC. It is the only song on the album that was previously unreleased. MacDonald describes the lyrics and music as \"almost derisively naive\". Lewisohn singles out the lyric \"When the June light turns to moonlight\" as the kind Lennon and McCartney \"usually spurned\" in others. McCartney reflected on the work in his official biography, Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, saying \"It’s a little bit too June-moon for me, but these were very early songs and they worked out quite well.\" In 1980, John Lennon said of the song, \"That’s Paul, through and through. Doesn’t it sound like him? Tra la la la la [laughs]. Yeah, that’s Paul on the voids (joys) of driving through the country.\" Everett writes the \"this way I will go\" lyrics, \"are too closely related, in an innocent way, to those of \"I'll Follow the Sun.\" He concludes that the chord transitions are ultimately uninteresting.\n\n \"I'm in Love\" is a song credited to Lennon–McCartney and possibly written by John Lennon. In 1963 the English Merseybeat band the Fourmost made a recording of the song at the EMI Studios, produced by George Martin. John Lennon said, in 1971, “Me — I wrote it for the Fourmost.” He seemed less definite in his 1980 Playboy interview. In Paul McCartney's authorized biography, Barry Miles seems to refer to this song as a collaboration. Billy J. Kramer also recorded a version of the song, but the version by the Fourmost was selected for the issue and reached number 17 in the United Kingdom. The B-side, \"Respectable\", is a cover from the Isley Brothers. In America, the song was recorded by the short-lived West Coast band, The New Breed. It appears on the album The \n\n John Lennon explained \"I'll Be on My Way\" \"was early Paul.\" Credited to Lennon–McCartney, Paul McCartney wrote the song in the first half of 1959. Author Todd Compton attributes it to \"McCartney–Lennon.\" McCartney wrote the song on his first guitar, a Framus Zenith acoustic guitar. In The Beatles Anthology, McCartney recalls, \"All my first songs... were written on the Zenith; songs like 'Michelle' and 'I Saw Her Standing There'. It was on this guitar that I learnt 'Twenty Flight Rock', the song that later got me into the group The Quarry Men.\" When first written, the song had little beyond its melody. The song was fleshed out years later after the Beatles added it to their live repertoire. The song is heavily inspired by Buddy Holly.

McCartney said, \"We knew that if we wrote a song called, 'Thank You Girl', that a lot of the girls who wrote us fan letters would take it as a genuine 'thank you'. So a lot of our songs were directly addressed to the fans.\" Written “eyeball to eyeball\", a phrase Lennon and McCartney would later use to describe their early formulaic writing sessions, \"Thank You Girl\" demonstrates how they were able to produce a song from scratch by working in total partnership. Lyrically, Ian MacDonald suggests that Lennon probably wrote the first line of each verse, allowing McCartney to use his flair \n\n John Lennon explained \"I'll Be on My Way\" \"was early Paul.\" Credited to Lennon–McCartney, Paul McCartney wrote the song in the first half of 1959.

The song was fleshed out years later after the Beatles added it to their live repertoire. The song is heavily inspired by Buddy Holly. Musicologist and writer Ian MacDonald writes, \"Played a little faster, the song reveals its debt to \n\n Paul McCartney, who had been present at Abbey Road Studios when Cilla Black had recorded her breakthrough hit \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\", had written \"It's for You\" with John Lennon using \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" as the model although Black herself has opined: \"For my money, ['It's for You'] is nothing like the 'Anyone...' composition.\"\n\n with Ono, the lyrics were delivered quickly like the Berry song, author Peter Doggett writing that \"each phrase [passes] too quickly to be understood at first hearing, the sound as important as the meaning\". When Lennon presented the composition to his bandmates, his songwriting partner Paul McCartney noticed its similarity to \"You Can't Catch Me\" and recommended they slow it in tempo to reduce the resemblance. Beatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\". In a December 1987 interview by Selina Scott on the television show West 57th Street, George Harrison stated that he wrote two lines of the song.\n\n The lyric concerns a man's entreaties to his girlfriend's young siblings not to reveal his courtship of their elder sister and to leave them alone, at some points, even bribing them with things like \"candy and a quarter\" and \"a movie\", on the condition that they \"keep a secret\". As such, it was a departure from the traditional love songs previously recorded by Kramer (sometimes supplied by Lennon & McCartney). When offered another Lennon and McCartney song, \"One and One Is Two\", for his next single by the manager of both groups, Brian Epstein, Kramer turned it down and chose \"Little Children\" instead, after a search for suitable material from music publishers.\n\nQuestion: What song did Paul McCartney write for Sean Lennon's siblings?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song was released in the United Kingdom in November 1996 and was released in the United States the following year. The single was well-received on the radio and peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and became Crow's fourth and final number-one single in Canada. The song earned a nomination for Record of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards but lost to \"Sunny Came Home\" by Shawn Colvin.

The track contains all acoustic and Latin percussion instruments performing in an Afro-Cuban rhythmic style. An eclectic, instrumental \"Latin Ballroom\" piano solo, played over the bridge section after the second verse, is also featured in part of the song; Joel states that the mix for the midsection includes \"fifteen pianos overdubbed on top of each other.\" The song spent two weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was released as the third single from the album Glass Houses and later included on Greatest Hits Volume 2. Billboard found the song to be \"catchy\" and felt that Joel's vocal performance sounded similar to Paul McCartney.\n\n The song was written by Elodie Hesme and David Gategno, while the production was handled by Julien Schultheis and Gategno. Elodie Hesme worked with Dion for the first time and wrote the lyrics to three songs from Sans attendre: \"Qui peut vivre sans amour?,\" \"Attendre\" and \"Si je n'ai rien de toi\". David Gategno already collaborated with Dion on D'elles in 2007, including composing and producing her French number-one single, \"Et s'il n'en restait qu'une (je serais celle-là)\". On Sans attendre he composed and produced four tracks: \"Qui peut vivre sans amour?,\" \"Attendre,\" \"La mer et l'enfant\" and \"Si je n'ai rien de toi\". \n\n The song is a ballad in 3/4 time in which Vélez sings about a French girl called Michèle, whom he spent a summer with and now cannot find. He sings that when he does find his Michèle again, he will ask her in her own language: \"Voulez-vous danser avec moi? Do you want to dance a waltz?\" Velez also recorded the song in French and German, as \"Voulez-vous danser avec moi?\" and \"Voulez-vous danser avec moi? (Señorita wir sind ein Paar)\" respectively.

The words of the song sung by Gavroche before his death are a parody of conservative views about the French Revolution: blaming all alleged modern social and moral ills on the influence of Voltaire and Rousseau. Gavroche sings \"Joie est mon caractère / C'est la faute à Voltaire / Misère est mon trousseau / C'est la faute à Rousseau.\" (I have a cheerful character / It's Voltaire's fault / Misery is my bridal gown / It's Rousseau's fault).\n\n The song references Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and the lyrics describe a young woman who insists that she is not \"too young\" for love. According to Dion, \"When I saw what Luc had written, I was bowled over. Like Eddy, Luc had explored my inner life. What he had written was so close to me that I couldn't help being really unsettled by it\". Dion said the song described her love for her manager and future husband René Angélil, \"The first time I sang the words to 'Lolita,' I was in front of René, and I sang it to arouse him\". The single was released with \"Ma chambre\" as B-side. \"Lolita (trop jeune pour aimer)\" was very successful reaching number 1 in Quebec for two weeks.

Mounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the Foreign Military Sales Act that Nixon signed in January 1971. Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973, over Nixon's veto.

It is of historic significance because it gave U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson authorization, without a formal declaration of war by Congress, for the use of conventional military force in Southeast Asia. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \"any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty\". This included involving armed forces. It was opposed in the Senate only by Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR) and Ernest Gruening (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\".

It advised on their website \"the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances.\" Furthermore, the FDA has not developed any rules or regulations on the defining features of what qualifies a product as \"natural\". The FDA does reference a definition \n\naccording to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year about 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die in the United States from foodborne diseases.\nHardly a day goes by when there isn’t a recall of food contaminated by a variety of microorganisms, oftentimes E. coli or salmonella. The foodborne illnesses caused by these contaminated products do not just result in stomachaches. They can cause chronic diseases, such as arthritis and kidney failure, or even death.\nPeople who are immune-compromised (for example, infants and children, pregnant women, older individuals and those undergoing chemotherapy) are more susceptible, and the effects are more severe. These facts signify a tremendous public health burden that is largely preventable.\nThe U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011. It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system. It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur.\nThe law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur.\nThe FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities.\nThe law is another milestone in food safety—the latest step to supplement hazard analysis and critical control point programs that have been mandated for a variety of commodities.\nAbout 15% of the U.S. food supply is imported. This increasing globalization of the food chain requires that the United States take a stronger role in helping other countries manage their sanitation levels and the care with which those commodities are treated.\nThe food supply is more complex and high tech than in the past. There is more food in the marketplace, and there are new hazards in foods that we have not previously seen.\nDemographics are shifting, and the population of individuals who are at risk from foodborne illnesses has increased by 30%, according to the CDC and World Health Organization.\nWhat is so historic about the FSMA is that it involves creation of a new food safety system and implements a broad prevention mandate and accountability, plus a new system of import oversight. It emphasizes partnerships and farm-to-table responsibility and was developed through a broad coalition.\nBuilding this new food safety system based on prevention will take time, and the FDA is creating a process for accomplishing this. Congress has established specific implementation dates in its legislation. Some authorizations, such as the FDA’s new authority to order companies to recall food, will go into effect quickly. Others require the FDA to prepare and issue regulations and guidance documents.\nThe funding the agency gets each year, which affects staffing and vital operations, will also influence how quickly the FDA can put this legislation into effect. The FDA, however, is committed to implementing the requirements through an open, transparent process with opportunity for input from all stakeholders.\nThe FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships.\nFor the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply.\nMandatory preventive controls for food facilities. Food facilities are required to implement written preventive control plans.\nThis involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise.\nThe timetable for these provisions is that a final rule is due within 18 months of enactment.\nAuthority to prevent intentional contamination. The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points.\nThe final rule regarding intentional contamination is due within 18 months of enactment.\nMandatory produce safety standards. The FDA must establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards and those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally during processing.\nThey also must address materials added to the soil (such as compost), hygiene, packaging, temperature controls and animals in the growing area and water. This final rule is due within two years of enactment.\nThe FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. Therefore, the FDA must provide oversight, ensure compliance with requirements and respond effectively when problems emerge.\nMandated inspection frequency. The FSMA establishes a mandated inspection frequency based on risk and requires the frequency of inspection to increase immediately. All high-risk domestic facilities must be inspected within five years of enactment and no less than every three years thereafter. Within one year of enactment, the law directs the agency to inspect at least 600 foreign facilities and double those inspections every year for the next five years.\nRecords access. The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans.\nTesting by accredited laboratories. The FSMA requires certain food testing to be performed by accredited laboratories and directs the FDA to establish a program for laboratory accreditation to ensure that U.S. food testing laboratories meet quality standards.\nThis compliance and inspection program must be established within two years of enactment.\nMandatory recall. The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA.\nExpanded administrative detention. The FSMA provides the FDA with a more flexible standard for administratively detaining products that are potentially in violation of the law.\nSuspension of registration. The FDA can suspend registration of a facility if it determines the food poses a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. A facility that is under suspension is prohibited from distributing food. This provision is effective six months after enactment.\nEnhanced product tracing abilities. The FDA is directed to establish a system that will enhance its ability to track and trace domestic and imported foods. In addition, the FDA is directed to establish pilot projects to explore and evaluate methods to rapidly and effectively identify recipients of food to prevent or control a foodborne illness outbreak. A pilot for this program must be implemented within nine months of enactment.\nAdditional recordkeeping for high-risk foods. The FDA is directed to issue proposed rulemaking to establish recordkeeping requirements for facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold foods that are designated as high risk. Implementation is due within two years of enactment.\nImporter accountability. For the first time, importers have an explicit responsibility to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls in place to ensure that the food they produce is safe. Implementation is due within one year of enactment.\nVoluntary qualified importer program. The FDA must establish a voluntary program for importers that provides for expedited review and entry of foods from participating importers. Eligibility is limited to importers offering food from certified facilities. Implementation is due within 18 months of enactment.\nThird-party certification. The FSMA establishes a program through which qualified third parties can certify that foreign food facilities comply with U.S. food safety standards. This certification may be used to facilitate the entry of imports. A system for FDA recognition of accreditation bodies is due within two years of enactment.\nCertification for high-risk foods. The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third-party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the United States.\nAuthority to deny entry. The FDA can refuse entry of food from a foreign facility into the United States if the FDA is denied access by the facility or the country in which the facility is located.\nState and local capacity building. The FDA must develop and implement strategies to leverage and enhance the food safety and defense capacities of state and local agencies. The FSMA provides the agency a new multiyear grant mechanism to facilitate investment in states’ capacity to more efficiently achieve national food safety goals.\nForeign capacity building. The law directs the FDA to develop a comprehensive plan to expand the capacity of foreign governments and their industries.\nReliance on inspections by other agencies. The FDA is explicitly authorized to rely on inspections of other federal, state and local agencies to meet its increased inspection mandate for domestic facilities. The FSMA also allows the FDA to enter into interagency agreements to leverage resources with respect to the inspection of seafood facilities, both domestic and foreign, as well as seafood imports.\nCompanies that produce, manufacture, import, distribute, store or market food are urged to evaluate the implications and benefits of the law for their business activities, regulatory compliance programs, and related legal and business risk management systems.\nThe FSMA requires strengthening of existing collaboration among all food safety agencies, whether federal, state, local or foreign. Among other provisions, the legislation directs the secretary of health and human services to improve training of state and local food safety officials and authorizes grants for training, conducting inspections, building capacity of labs and food safety programs, and other food safety activities.\nBuilding and leveraging the capacity of these food safety partners is how we can have a well-integrated, national food safety system that is effective, efficient, and provides an increased level of comfort to the public.\nLes Schnoll has more than 35 years of experience in industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

The FSMA, signed into law in 2011, aims to strengthen the food safety system by focusing more on prevention rather than reaction to food safety problems.\n\nUnder the FSMA, the FDA has gained new enforcement authorities to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards. This enables the agency to better protect public health and safety. It also provides the FDA with tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods, ensuring consistency in food safety regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the FSMA directs the FDA to collaborate with state and local authorities, building an integrated national food safety system. This partnership enhances coordination and communication to effectively prevent and respond to food safety issues.\n\nFurthermore, the FSMA supplements hazard analysis and critical control point programs that were already mandated for various commodities. These programs focus on identifying and controlling potential hazards at critical points during production, processing, and distribution.\n\nOverall, the measures taken by the FDA, as mandated by the FSMA, prioritize prevention, improve enforcement, and establish collaborations to enhance food safety and reduce the risks of foodborne illnesses.\n\nQuestion: The food safety system of the agency that has the authority to decide if a drug is marketed otc or prescription is known as?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Secret Service protection for Obama began after he received a death threat in 2007, while serving as the junior United States senator from Illinois and running for president. This marked the earliest time a candidate received such protection before being nominated. Security was increased early for Obama due to fears of possible assassination attempts by white supremacist or other racist groups or individuals against the first African American major party presidential nominee. Some of \n\n The United States Senate career of Barack Obama began on January 3, 2005, and ended on November 16, 2008. He resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate upon being elected President of the United States. Obama won the seat in an election against Alan Keyes who replaced Republican Primary election winner Jack Ryan. Prior to his election but after Ryan withdrew from the race, he rose to national prominence by delivering the 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address. Upon his election, he became the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, the third to have been popularly elected. As a Senator, he served on a variety of committees and chaired the United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \n\n election. Irvin was the only African-American in the race. Weisner won eight of the city's 10 wards and nearly two-thirds of its precincts. When Barack Obama visited Aurora on February 25 for his 10th town hall meeting after his 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois, he noted that as a Democrat he was inclined to support Weisner, but he made no endorsement. However, in the final days before the general election, Obama returned to endorse Weisner. The day after the election, the Chicago Tribune reported Weisner took 59% of the vote, and the Chicago Sun-Times reported that he took 68%. When the results were finally tabulated in Aurora, which spans four counties, the Tribune turned out to be correct. Weisner took the oath of office on April 26, 2005.\n\n Barack Obama served three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2005, when he was elected to the United States Senate. During this part of his career, Obama continued teaching constitutional law part time at the University of Chicago Law School as he had done as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, Senator Alice Palmer decided to run for the United States House of Representatives, leaving the Senate's 13th district seat open. When filing opened in 1995 for her seat, Obama entered the race. Eventually, his challengers were disqualified and he won the Democratic primary unopposed in 1996. He won re-election in 1998 and 2002. During his Senate tenure, Obama was involved with a wide range of legislation. While serving, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in the 2000 elections. In the redistricting following the 2000 Census, the Democrats gained control of the Illinois Senate, and Obama became more active in his legislation, which included work in areas such as health care, labor, law enforcement, campaign finance reform, welfare, and community reinvestment.\n\n during the Atlantic Slave Trade. On November 4, 2008, Democratic Senator Barack Obama defeated Republican Senator John McCain to become the first African American to be elected president. At least 95 percent of African-American voters voted for Obama. He also received overwhelming support from young and educated Whites, a majority of Asians, and Hispanics, picking up a number of new states in the Democratic electoral column. Obama lost the overall White vote, although he won a larger proportion of White votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter. Obama was reelected for a second and final term, by a similar margin on November 6, 2012.

In 1974, Jackson sponsored the Jackson-Vanik amendment in the Senate (with Charles Vanik sponsoring it in the House), which denied normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted the freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to help refugees, particularly minorities, specifically Jews, to emigrate from the Soviet Bloc.

The law gave the President broad powers to conduct military operations without an actual declaration of war. The resolution passed unanimously in the House of Representatives and was opposed in the Senate by only two members. National Security Council members, including United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and General Maxwell Taylor, agreed on November 28 to recommend that Johnson adopt a plan for a two-stage escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam.\n\n The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution or the Southeast Asia Resolution,, was a joint resolution that the United States Congress passed on August 7, 1964, in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. It is of historic significance because it gave U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson authorization, without a formal declaration of war by Congress, for the use of conventional military force in Southeast Asia. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \"any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty\". This included involving armed forces. It was opposed in the Senate only by Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR) and Ernest Gruening (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\".

In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam. Kerry was the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1987 to 1989.

This act is related to the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological products by the FDA. These changes were made in order to recognize the changes in the way the FDA would be operating in the 21st century. The main focus of this is the acknowledgment in the advancement of technological, trade, and public health complexities.\n\nThe FDA, also known as the United States Food and Drug Administration, plays a crucial role in ensuring public health. The agency is responsible for overseeing and regulating a wide range of products, including food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and more.\n\nThe primary objective of the FDA is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. They achieve this through various regulatory and enforcement actions. For example, the FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), which sets the standards and regulations for food, drugs, and cosmetics marketed in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the FD&C Act, the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This wide-ranging authority allows the FDA to address public health concerns beyond food and drugs. They regulate and control items like medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products.\n\nTo fulfill its mission, the FDA is led by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The agency operates under the Department of Health and Human Services, with the Commissioner reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe FDA has a comprehensive organizational structure that includes various offices and divisions. These include the Office of the Commissioner, Office of Operations, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Office of Human Resources, Office of Finance, Budget and Acquisition, and Office of Information Management and Technology, among others. This structure allows the FDA to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities and protect public health.\n\nOverall, the FDA plays a crucial role in safeguarding the well-being of the public by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of numerous products essential for daily life. They are dedicated to upholding public health standards and promoting the safety of the American population.\n\nThe FDA, or the United States Food and Drug Administration, is responsible for regulating and supervising various areas related to public health. These areas include food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, cosmetics, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products. \n\nIn addition to enforcing the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This means that they have responsibilities beyond just food and drugs. For example, they also regulate devices like lasers and cellular phones, and oversee disease control in various contexts, including household pets and human reproductive donations.\n\nThe FDA is headed by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The agency's headquarters is located in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland, and they have field offices and laboratories throughout the United States, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Additionally, the FDA has also placed employees in foreign countries, including China, India, Costa Rica, Chile, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOverall, the FDA plays a vital role in protecting and promoting public health, ensuring the safety and quality of various products and services that impact our daily lives.\n\n The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations.

This allows the user to assess the impact of different decisions on food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs.\n\nOne key advantage of the STARTEC tool is its product-specific and multidisciplinary nature. It takes into account various factors and provides interpretation and targeted recommendations for end-users. It has been tested and approved by end-users based on selected ready-to-eat food products.\n\nOverall, the STARTEC Decision Support Tool helps the food industry make informed decisions by integrating food safety, quality, nutrition, and cost considerations. It provides a comprehensive approach and assists users in optimizing their production processes for ready-to-eat foods.\n\naccording to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year about 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die in the United States from foodborne diseases.\nHardly a day goes by when there isn’t a recall of food contaminated by a variety of microorganisms, oftentimes E. coli or salmonella. The foodborne illnesses caused by these contaminated products do not just result in stomachaches. They can cause chronic diseases, such as arthritis and kidney failure, or even death.\nPeople who are immune-compromised (for example, infants and children, pregnant women, older individuals and those undergoing chemotherapy) are more susceptible, and the effects are more severe. These facts signify a tremendous public health burden that is largely preventable.\nThe U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011. It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system. It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur.\nThe law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur.\nThe FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities.\nThe law is another milestone in food safety—the latest step to supplement hazard analysis and critical control point programs that have been mandated for a variety of commodities.\nAbout 15% of the U.S. food supply is imported. This increasing globalization of the food chain requires that the United States take a stronger role in helping other countries manage their sanitation levels and the care with which those commodities are treated.\nThe food supply is more complex and high tech than in the past. There is more food in the marketplace, and there are new hazards in foods that we have not previously seen.\nDemographics are shifting, and the population of individuals who are at risk from foodborne illnesses has increased by 30%, according to the CDC and World Health Organization.\nWhat is so historic about the FSMA is that it involves creation of a new food safety system and implements a broad prevention mandate and accountability, plus a new system of import oversight. It emphasizes partnerships and farm-to-table responsibility and was developed through a broad coalition.\nBuilding this new food safety system based on prevention will take time, and the FDA is creating a process for accomplishing this. Congress has established specific implementation dates in its legislation. Some authorizations, such as the FDA’s new authority to order companies to recall food, will go into effect quickly. Others require the FDA to prepare and issue regulations and guidance documents.\nThe funding the agency gets each year, which affects staffing and vital operations, will also influence how quickly the FDA can put this legislation into effect. The FDA, however, is committed to implementing the requirements through an open, transparent process with opportunity for input from all stakeholders.\nThe FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships.\nFor the first time, FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply.\nMandatory preventive controls for food facilities. Food facilities are required to implement written preventive control plans.\nThis involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise.\nThe timetable for these provisions is that a final rule is due within 18 months of enactment.\nAuthority to prevent intentional contamination. The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points.\nThe final rule regarding intentional contamination is due within 18 months of enactment.\nMandatory produce safety standards. The FDA must establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards and those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally during processing.\nThey also must address materials added to the soil (such as compost), hygiene, packaging, temperature controls and animals in the growing area and water. This final rule is due within two years of enactment.\nThe FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. Therefore, the FDA must provide oversight, ensure compliance with requirements and respond effectively when problems emerge.\nMandated inspection frequency. The FSMA establishes a mandated inspection frequency based on risk and requires the frequency of inspection to increase immediately. All high-risk domestic facilities must be inspected within five years of enactment and no less than every three years thereafter. Within one year of enactment, the law directs the agency to inspect at least 600 foreign facilities and double those inspections every year for the next five years.\nRecords access. The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans.\nTesting by accredited laboratories. The FSMA requires certain food testing to be performed by accredited laboratories and directs the FDA to establish a program for laboratory accreditation to ensure that U.S. food testing laboratories meet quality standards.\nThis compliance and inspection program must be established within two years of enactment.\nMandatory recall. The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA.\nExpanded administrative detention. The FSMA provides the FDA with a more flexible standard for administratively detaining products that are potentially in violation of the law.\nSuspension of registration. The FDA can suspend registration of a facility if it determines the food poses a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. A facility that is under suspension is prohibited from distributing food. This provision is effective six months after enactment.\nEnhanced product tracing abilities. The FDA is directed to establish a system that will enhance its ability to track and trace domestic and imported foods. In addition, the FDA is directed to establish pilot projects to explore and evaluate methods to rapidly and effectively identify recipients of food to prevent or control a foodborne illness outbreak. A pilot for this program must be implemented within nine months of enactment.\nAdditional recordkeeping for high-risk foods. The FDA is directed to issue proposed rulemaking to establish recordkeeping requirements for facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold foods that are designated as high risk. Implementation is due within two years of enactment.\nImporter accountability. For the first time, importers have an explicit responsibility to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls in place to ensure that the food they produce is safe. Implementation is due within one year of enactment.\nVoluntary qualified importer program. The FDA must establish a voluntary program for importers that provides for expedited review and entry of foods from participating importers. Eligibility is limited to importers offering food from certified facilities. Implementation is due within 18 months of enactment.\nThird-party certification. The FSMA establishes a program through which qualified third parties can certify that foreign food facilities comply with U.S. food safety standards. This certification may be used to facilitate the entry of imports. A system for FDA recognition of accreditation bodies is due within two years of enactment.\nCertification for high-risk foods. The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third-party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the United States.\nAuthority to deny entry. The FDA can refuse entry of food from a foreign facility into the United States if the FDA is denied access by the facility or the country in which the facility is located.\nState and local capacity building. The FDA must develop and implement strategies to leverage and enhance the food safety and defense capacities of state and local agencies. The FSMA provides the agency a new multiyear grant mechanism to facilitate investment in states’ capacity to more efficiently achieve national food safety goals.\nForeign capacity building. The law directs the FDA to develop a comprehensive plan to expand the capacity of foreign governments and their industries.\nReliance on inspections by other agencies. The FDA is explicitly authorized to rely on inspections of other federal, state and local agencies to meet its increased inspection mandate for domestic facilities. The FSMA also allows the FDA to enter into interagency agreements to leverage resources with respect to the inspection of seafood facilities, both domestic and foreign, as well as seafood imports.\nCompanies that produce, manufacture, import, distribute, store or market food are urged to evaluate the implications and benefits of the law for their business activities, regulatory compliance programs, and related legal and business risk management systems.\nThe FSMA requires strengthening of existing collaboration among all food safety agencies, whether federal, state, local or foreign. Among other provisions, the legislation directs the secretary of health and human services to improve training of state and local food safety officials and authorizes grants for training, conducting inspections, building capacity of labs and food safety programs, and other food safety activities.\nBuilding and leveraging the capacity of these food safety partners is how we can have a well-integrated, national food safety system that is effective, efficient, and provides an increased level of comfort to the public.\nLes Schnoll has more than 35 years of experience in industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Cohen exhibited a voracious appetite for films as a child, visiting the movie theaters at least twice a week, and most of them being double features, the young Cohen managed to consume at least four movies a week. He was a fan of the hard-boiled and film noir movies that featured actors such as Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney; films that were penned by the likes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett.

The main line of the nation's 4800 km railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways. The road network has expanded rapidly to over 21000 mi, covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases. In addition to overseas routes, Egypt Air provides reliable domestic air service to major tourist destinations from its Cairo hub. The Nile River system (about 1600 km.) and the principal canals (1,600 km.) are used for local transportation. The Suez Canal is a major waterway for international commerce and navigation, linking the Mediterranean and Red Sea. It is run by the Suez Canal Authority, headquartered in Port Said. The ministry of transportation, along with other governmental bodies are responsible for transportation in Egypt. Major ports are Alexandria, Port Said, and Damietta on the Mediterranean, and Suez, Ain Sokhna and Safaga on the Red Sea.\n\n As a body of water that crosses numerous international political borders, the Nile river is subject to multiple political interactions. It is the world's longest river flowing 6,700 kilometers through ten countries in northeastern Africa – Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt with varying climates. Considering the basin area of the Nile, Sudan has the largest size (1.9 million km²) whereas, of the four major tributaries to the Nile, three originate from Ethiopia – the Blue Nile, Sobat and Atbara. The modern history of hydropolitics in the Nile basin is very complex and has had wide ramifications both for regional and global developments.\n\n   Lower Egypt (مصر السفلى Miṣr as-Suflā; Tsakhet) is the northernmost region of Egypt, which consists of the fertile Nile Delta between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, from El Aiyat, south of modern-day Cairo, and Dahshur. Historically, the Nile River split into seven branches of the delta in Lower Egypt. Lower Egypt was divided into nomes and began to advance as a civilization after 3600 BC. Today, it contains two major channels that flow through the delta of the Nile River – Mahmoudiyah Canal (ancient Agathos Daimon) and Muways Canal (بحر موَيس, \"waterway of Moses\").\n\n  The Nile Valley and Delta, the most extensive oasis on earth, was created by the world's longest river and its seemingly inexhaustible sources. Without the topographic channel that permits the Nile to flow across the Sahara, Egypt would be entirely desert. The length within Egypt of the River Nile in its northwards course from three central African sources – the White Nile, the Blue Nile, and the Atbara – totals some 1,600 km. The White Nile, which begins at Lake Victoria in Uganda, supplies about 28% of the Nile's Egyptian waters. In its course from Lake Victoria to Juba in South \n\n  Ancient Egypt was a long-lived civilisation geographically located in north-eastern Africa. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the Nile River, reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium BC, which is referred to as the New Kingdom period. It reached broadly from the Nile Delta in the north, as far south as Jebel Barkal at the Fourth Cataract of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilisation included, at different times, areas of the southern Levant, the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea coastline, the Sinai Peninsula and the Western Desert (focused on the several oases).

CO marine engines were installed in British decoy fishing ships to lure German submarines within range of their 6\" naval guns. In 1939 Fairbanks-Morse developed a marine engine using an unusual opposed piston (O. P.) design, similar in arrangement to a series of German Junkers aircraft diesels. The most common variant for submarines through the 1990s was the 38D 8-1/8 engine, ranging from 4 to 12 cylinders. This engine was delivered to the U.S. Navy in large numbers, often for use in fleet submarines, which used 9- or 10-cylinder versions as main engines in World War II.   When the innovative but faulty \"pancake\" engines of the  proved unworkable, \n\n and sugar, rice, timber, and mine mills used the engine. The model Y was available in sizes from one through six cylinders, or 10 to 200 hp. The Y-VA engine was the first high-compression, cold-start, full diesel developed by Fairbanks Morse without the acquisition of any foreign patent. This machine was developed in Beloit and introduced in 1924. The company expanded its line to the marine CO engine (Many 100 H.P. CO marine engines were used in the Philippine Islands to power ferry boats) as well as the mill model E, a modernized Y diesel. From this, Fairbanks-Morse became a major engine manufacturer and developed plants for railway and marine applications. The development of the diesel locomotive, tug, and ship in the 1930s fostered the expansion of the company.\n\n In 1905 car builder Delahaye had experimented with a DOHC marine racing engine with six valves per cylinder. This Delahaye Titan engine was a massive 5190 cid (85.0-liter) four-cylinder that produced 350 bhp (0.07 bhp/cid). It allowed the motor boat Le Dubonnet piloted by Emile Dubonnet to set a new world's speed record on water, reaching 33.80 mi/h on the lake at Juvisy, near Paris, France. An example of modern multi-valve engines for small boats is the Volvo Penta IPS Series. These joystick-operated seawater-cooled inboard diesel engines use combined charging (turbo and supercharger, except IPS450) with aftercooler, common rail fuel injection and DOHCs with hydraulic 4-valve technology. Propshaft power ranges from 248 to 850 bhp (highest efficiency 59.7 kW/liter for IPS400 3.7-liter straight-4 diesel). Multiple units can be combined.\n\n Fairbanks-Morse, is a historic American (and Canadian) industrial scale manufacturer. It later diversified into pumps, engines and industrial supplies. One arm of the company is now a Diesel engine manufacturer located in Beloit, Wisconsin and has specialized in the manufacture of opposed-piston Diesel engines for United States Navy vessels and railroad locomotives since 1932. The diesel railroad locomotives the company produced are as follows:\n\n Fairbanks Morse continued to build diesel and gas engines, as it had been doing for the first half of the twentieth century. This is in addition to the pump and engine division, which produced Canadian Fairbanks Morse branded products for farms, factories and mines. Export offices were established in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; a factory was opened in Mexico, where model Z engines were built well into the 1980s. An Australian branch factory, similar to the Canadian Branch operation, was opened and remote sheep stations benefited from their products. It dated from 1902, when Cooper Sheep Shearing Machinery Ltd was set up in Sydney, and became an agent for Fairbanks Morse in that Hemisphere. The company sold and updated the Eclipse model of windmill pumps in North America until they became obsolete \n\nQuestion: Where is the river that the engine pumped water from located in the world?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After they return to Chicago, they have the marriage annulled, but this did not stop Chuck and Susan from further dating. Chuck was injured in the helicopter crash on the roof of the hospital and had emergency surgery to remove his spleen. In this same crash, Dr. Romano was killed as the helicopter fell off the roof and landed on Dr. Romano on the ground. Susan later had a baby boy named Cosmo, whom Chuck looked after when Susan was promoted to Chief of Emergency Medicine after Dr. Romano's death.

In 1893 the couple lived in a \"cosey\" home and both had studios on the top floor. By 1896, Nicholls and her husband were living in a West 50th Street mansion in New York City. They had a daughter, Rhoda Olive, and a son, Arundel Holmes Nicholls, who became favored subjects for her works. The couple's marriage became contentious when one of Holmes Nicholls works was accepted by the Paris Salon for exhibition, but her husband's work was rejected.

The Alaska Range runs just north of Denali State Park and inside of Denali National Park, making the national park a more well known tourist destination. Denali State Park is in sight of Mount Denali. Denali is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation 20,310 feet above sea level. Since it rises roughly 18000 ft base to peak it is the largest mountain situated entirely above sea level. To the east, the state park borders the Susitna River, which feeds into the Gompertz Channel near Anchorage, then into the ocean. There are several other rivers in the park and the surrounding area which are visited by tourists. Denali State Park is home to many different terrains, animals, plants, and opportunities to safely and respectfully enjoy these parts of a natural wild environment.\n\n Dominated by the Ahklun Mountains in the north and the cold waters of Bristol Bay to the south, Togiak National Wildlife Refuge confronts the traveler with a kaleidoscope of landscapes. The natural forces that have shaped this land range from the violent and powerful to the geologically patient. Earthquakes and volcanoes filled the former role, and their marks can still be found, but it was the gradual advance and retreat of glacial ice that carved many of the physical features of this refuge. The refuge has a surface area of 4102537 acre. It is the fourth-largest National Wildlife Refuge in the United States as well as the state of Alaska, which has all eleven of the largest NWRs. It is bordered in the southeast by Wood-Tikchik State Park, the largest state park in the United States.\n\n Savage River State Forest is one of the most used public lands for hunting. White-tailed deer is the most common species hunted in the forest and throughout the state. \"A recent survey sponsored by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies found that deer hunting in 2006 generated over $113 million in retail sales, with a total multiplier effect of over $190 million contributed to Maryland’s economy. Deer hunting in Maryland supports nearly 2,300 jobs and generates $71 million in salaries, wages, and business owner’s income, $15 million in state and local tax revenue, and $16 million in federal tax revenue.\" \n\n or Sustainable Tourism plays a vital role. The economic benefits affect not only the park areas but also the local communities. Ecotourism accounts for 4.6% of Chile's GNP. Since the 1980s Chile has been promoting ecotourism, and has seen annual increases in both visitors and income occur every year since. Between 2006 and 2007 visitor numbers increased from 2.25 million to 2.5 million. Revenue from ecotourism services and national parks results in a 2-3% increase in gross income. Through the year 43% of tourists visit national parks in the regions of de los Rios and de los Lagos. The top three destinations in those areas are the Coguillio National Park, the Villarica National Park, and the Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park. The last of those hosts 25% of all visitors to Chile.\n\n the hunter. There are some other advantages of eco-hunting, as the hunter has the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS animal tracking project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are typically lower than trophy hunting (up to $60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for microchipping, ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved. Due to the significantly reduced terminal ballistics, the hunter must get within 30 m from the target animal to successfully dart it, often much closer than required for traditional hunting.

All other reserves such as the Dinokeng game reserve must be managed by people to maintain a predator-prey balance and avoid inbreeding. The Dinokeng game reserve is a member of the Lions Management Forum (LiMF), a community of reserve managers from all over the country who shares management experience, discusses and finds a management solution that is suitable for long-term subsistence of lions. Although the Dinokeng game reserve has successfully managed the total number of lions through selective contraception, the reserve must address the existence of too many young men.

Trophy hunting creates crucial financial incentives for the development and/or retention of wildlife as a land use over large areas in Africa, including in areas where ecotourism is not viable. Hunting plays an important role in the rehabilitation of degraded wildlife areas by enabling the income generation from wildlife without affecting population growth of trophy species.\" The policy of trophy hunting has been adopted in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. The income generated in total in Africa is quoted to be USD 201 million/year, derived from about 18,500 international \n\n been denounced by several organizations, including the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa, the South African Veterinary Council, Game Rangers Association of Africa and the Department of Environmental Affairs. In recent years, green hunting has received little attention and has been further impacted by new legislation in South Africa such as the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act and the Threatened or Protected Species Regulations. Amid this negative reputation, green hunting continues in the form of spectator darting safaris in South Africa and its role in the mitigation of rhinoceros horn trade is still considered valuable. Green hunting in Paraguay funds jaguar relocation projects.\n\n Dinokeng game reserve partnered with the South African government to enforce laws that protect the natural resources of protected areas. Most employees in Dinokeng Game Reserves are from local residents living in protected areas and local residents from the communities surrounding the Reserve. At Dinokeng, it implemented different actions that helped spread environmental awareness to surrounding communities and visitors. Wildlife and Ecological Investment (WEI) conducted ecological surveys and biodiversity monitoring in the Dinokeng Game Reserve. Protected areas use the data collected and analyzed by WEI to review changes in protected areas, and management can gain insight into the operation and health of protected areas. In addition, baseline data can contribute to future professional research or management decisions.\n\n Tourism is an increasingly important industry in Botswana, accounting for almost 12% of GDP.

The country offers excellent game viewing and birding both in the Delta and in the Chobe National Park—home to one of the largest herds of free-ranging elephants in the world. Botswana's Central Kalahari Game Reserve also offers good game viewing and some of the remotest and most unspoiled wilderness in southern Africa. A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions. The main safari destinations for tourism are Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta, and Chobe National Park. Botswana is also participating in community-based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of Khwai and its Khwai Development Trust. Botswana was the setting for the 1980 movie The Gods Must Be Crazy, although the movie was mostly filmed in South Africa. The seventh season of The Amazing Race visited Botswana. Tourism has been stimulated by the series of detective novels by Alexander McCall Smith and the American dramatisation that followed them.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the game reserve in the country where hunters spend 50 to 100 times more than the average ecotourist?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Of particular interest to the government of Namibia is that it gives access to the Zambezi River and is thereby a potential trading route to Africa's East Coast. However, the vagaries of the river level, various rapids, the presence of the Victoria Falls downstream and continued political uncertainty in the region make this use of the Caprivi Strip unlikely, although it may be used for ecotourism in the future. Within Namibia the Caprivi Strip provides significant habitat for the critically endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). It is a corridor for African elephant moving from Botswana and Namibia into Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. National parks found in the Caprivi Strip are Bwabwata National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara National Park. Local communities have organised themselves into communal area conservancies and community forests. People work closely with the Namibian Government to jointly manage natural resources through several programmes set up between the Namibian Government and various donor parties.\n\n small and medium-scale agriculture, large-scale agriculture, pasture for livestock, gold mining, coca cultivation, and road construction. The Amazon's innate beauty and its continuous destruction altogether draw tourists to Peru through ecotourism and environmental voluntourism. The Peruvian Amazon is divided into two areas: the High Jungle and the Lower Jungle. The High Jungle is more easily accessible, while the Lower Jungle is more pristine and untouched. In recent times, however, the government has increased accessibility to the Lower Jungle. Both areas contain an unrivaled diversity of animal and plant life. Large national preserves of interest to tourists include the Manú National Park, Rio Abiseo National Park, \n\n  Namibia is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. Agriculture, herding, tourism and the mining industry – including mining for gem diamonds, uranium, gold, silver, and base metals – form the basis of its economy.

Even under the strict veterinary procedures of a research context, there are several cases of death due to tranquilization related complications. It has been suggested that the banning of green hunting in South Africa is contradictory given that trophy hunting remains legal. In Zimbabwe, a survey showed that most hunters would prefer green hunts over trophy hunts and called for an international certification system to diminish corruption. Corruption issues of green hunting are aggravated by the complex, fragmented and outdated regulatory system for private protected areas, without international standards. Further sensitization of stakeholders to principles of conservation ecology and regional and international cooperation is suggested for the long term success of future initiatives. Green hunting is sometimes grouped with the much more controversial practice of canned hunting.\n\n because low off-take is required to ensure high trophy quality and marketability in future seasons. Trophy hunting creates crucial financial incentives for the development and/or retention of wildlife as a land use over large areas in Africa, including in areas where ecotourism is not viable. Hunting plays an important role in the rehabilitation of degraded wildlife areas by enabling the income generation from wildlife without affecting population growth of trophy species.\" The policy of trophy hunting has been adopted in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. The income generated in total in Africa is quoted to be USD 201 million/year, derived from about 18,500 international \n\nQuestion: Who is the permanent representative to the united nations of the country where it is estimated that a hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was released on November 7, 2000 as the lead single from their fourth full-length studio album, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000). It was released in two standalone physical formats. The first, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 1,\" was released on November 6, 2000 in the UK. It features Manson's cover of John Lennon's \"Working Class Hero\". The second, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2,\" followed on November 14, 2000 and features a cover of The Doors' \"Five to One\". \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2\" was also released as a 12\" picture disc vinyl LP. It is considered a teenage anthem of sorts, echoing what Manson see as teenagers who act violently in retaliation against parental and social authority. The chorus borrows lyrically from the Beatles' song, \"Revolution.\" \n\n \"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all members of the band for their second studio album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002). The song is built around prominent acoustic and electric guitar riffs with accompanying up-tempo drumming. The song was released on 1 July 2003 as the fourth and final single from the album. Regional singles were released for Canada, Europe, Australia, and an enhanced version for Taiwan. Promo singles were released for the United Kingdom and United States. Since only promo copies were released, the single itself reached only number 100 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n \"To Build a Home\" is a song by English electronic music group The Cinematic Orchestra, with vocals and piano performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson. It was released as the second single from the group's third studio album, Ma Fleur (2007), on 29 October 2007. The song's music video was notable for including themes of euthanasia in a short narrative film that also included the song ‘Breathe’, and ran to over 12 minutes. Shot on location in Cumbria, the video was premiered on Channel Four, featuring the actors Peter Mullan and Julia Ford, and directed by animator Andrew Griffin. In 2015, the song peaked at number 96 on the French Singles Chart.\n\n \"Lonely Day\" is a song by Armenian American metal band System of a Down. It was released in 2006 as the second single from their fifth album Hypnotize (2005), and written by guitarist Daron Malakian, who also provides lead vocals on this track. The song received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. This was System of a Down's last single for 14 years, until they released two new songs (\"Protect the Land\" and \"Genocidal Humanoidz\") in 2020. The song is featured in the 2007 film Disturbia, as well as the film's trailer; however, it is not included in the film's soundtrack.\n\n \"Isolation\" is a song written and performed by Alter Bridge, released as the first single from its third album, AB III. The song was made available as a digital download on September 26, 2010, in the United Kingdom by Roadrunner Records and October 25, 2010, in the United States by the band's own vanity label. Musically, \"Isolation\" is heavy and aggressive, featuring the band's style while retaining a melodic chorus and incorporating elements of alternative metal and speed metal. The lyrics explore metaphorically isolating oneself from faith and belief, a common theme throughout the record. A music video for the song was released on December 6, 2010. The song was included in the racing video game Dirt 3 in 2011.

The government played a powerful role in the industrialization of the German Empire founded by Otto von Bismarck in 1871 during a period known as the Second Industrial Revolution. It supported not only heavy industry but also crafts and trades because it wanted to maintain prosperity in all parts of the empire.

Schiller's success in the Grand Coalition helped to give the SPD an electoral victory in 1969 and a chance to form a new coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei—FDP) under Willy Brandt. The SPD-FDP coalition expanded the West German social security system, substantially increasing the size and cost of the social budget. Social program costs grew by over 10 percent a year during much of the 1970s, introducing into the budget an unalterable obligation that reduced fiscal flexibility (although Schiller and other Keynesians believed that it would \n\n Chancellor Hans Luther had resigned on 13 May 1926 following a controversy over the use of the Reichsflagge and refused to remain in office as caretaker.

However, the SPD was unwilling to tolerate a minority cabinet led by him. The parliamentary group of the Zentrum then asked Konrad Adenauer, mayor of Cologne, to come to Berlin. However, Adenauer was unwilling to build a temporary minority cabinet as a stepping stone to an eventual grand coalition and aimed at the creation of a majority government, including the SPD.

Securing materials for armaments production and the control of food markets were two areas where the German government was involved from the start of the conflict. Private corporations were created under the supervision of the government to oversee specified industries and manage the supply and distribution of foodstuffs. This began in November 1914 with the establishment of a wheat corporation. There were around 200 of these corporations by the end of the war, representing an unprecedented level of cooperation between government and the private sector. The insatiable demands on manpower led to yet more government intervention and triggered a massive redistribution of the workforce from \"peacetime\" industries to war industries and \n\n the Jewish minority, political leftists and many other groups. After being elected, the national socialists undertook a series of rapid steps to abolish democracy. Their trade policy in Germany consisted of an autarkic policy regime that aimed to cancel all imports, such as foodstuffs, that could be replaced with domestic substitutes or raw materials for the consumer-oriented industries. Only imports of iron ore and similar items were considered necessary because a main aim of the government was to strengthen the production capacity of military products. Both the persecuted and non-persecuted German groups suffered from these autarkic and trade-restraining policies.\n\nQuestion: Who constituted the free crops in the location where the democratic government set up in Germany in 1919?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2016, it had a population of 250,704. A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Brunswick was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century. It was the capital city of three successive states: the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269–1432, 1754–1807, and 1813–1814), the Duchy of Brunswick (1814–1918), and the Free State of Brunswick (1918–1946). Today, Brunswick is the second-largest city in Lower Saxony and a major centre of scientific research and development.\n\n In 1806, the city was captured by the French during the Napoleonic Wars and became part of the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807. The exiled Duke Frederick William raised a volunteer corps, the Black Brunswickers, who fought the French in several battles. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Brunswick was made capital of the re-established independent Duchy of Brunswick, later a constituent state of the German Empire from 1871. In the aftermath of the July Revolution in 1830, in Brunswick duke Charles II was forced to abdicate. His absolutist governing style had previously alienated the nobility and bourgeoisie, while the lower classes were disaffected by the bad economic \n\n  On 8 November 1918, at the end of World War I, a socialist workers' council forced Duke Ernest Augustus to abdicate. On 10 November, the council proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Brunswick under one-party government by the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD); however, the subsequent Landtag election on 22 December 1918 was won by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), and the USPD and MSPD formed a coalition government. An uprising in Braunschweig in 1919, led by the communist Spartacus League, was defeated when Freikorps troops under Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker took over the city on order of the German Minister of \n\nBlankenburg (divided in 1945 between British and Soviet zone of occupation) ; Braunschweig ; Gandersheim ; Holzminden (to the Prussian province of Hanover on 1 November 1941 in return for the District of Goslar and the City of Goslar) ; Helmstedt ; Wolfenbüttel The Free State of Brunswick initially comprised the City of Braunschweig and the following rural districts: On 1 April 1942 the city district of Watenstedt-Salzgitter was established on Goslar and Wolfenbüttel territory.\n\n Gustav Noske. An SPD-led government was subsequently established; in December 1921, a new constitution was approved for the Free State of Brunswick, now a parliamentary republic within the Weimar Republic, again with Braunschweig as its capital. After the Landtag election of 1930, Brunswick became the second state in Germany where the Nazis participated in government, when the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) formed a coalition government with several conservative and right-wing parties. With the support of Dietrich Klagges, Brunswick's minister of the interior, the NSDAP organized a large SA rally in Braunschweig.

It was the first organized mass working-class party in European history. The organization existed by this name until 1875, when it combined with the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) to form the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. This unified organization was renamed soon thereafter the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which presently remains in existence and dates its origins to the founding of the ADAV. Its Austrian part would become the SPÖ. The ADAV was the first German Labour Party, formed in Prussia prior to the establishment of the German Empire. It was active in the German Confederation, which included the Austrian Empire.\n\n isolate those in the party opposed to the war, but could not prevent a split. Ebert was a pivotal figure in the German Revolution of 1918–19. When Germany became a republic at the end of World War I, he became its first chancellor. His policies at that time were primarily aimed at restoring peace and order in Germany and suppressing the left. To accomplish these goals, he allied himself with conservative and nationalistic political forces, in particular the leadership of the military under General Wilhelm Groener and the right-wing Freikorps. With their help, Ebert's government crushed a number of socialist and communist uprisings as well as those from the right, including the Kapp Putsch, a legacy that has made him a controversial historical figure.\n\n The SDAPÖ played an important role in the establishment of the First Republic. On November 11, 1918, Emperor Charles I relinquished his right to take part in Austrian affairs of state. The following day Karl Renner was declared Chancellor of the Republic of German-Austria. The Bohemian provincial organization of SDAPÖ held a conference in Teplice 31 August – 3 September 1919 at which it re-constituted itself as a separate party, the German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic. The party clearly wanted to steer Austria towards political union with Germany, calling the new Austrian republic \"Deutsch-Österreich\" (German-Austria). But the Treaty of St. Germain clearly forbade any unification between Austria and Germany. The SDAPÖ nevertheless still advocated such a union during the existence of the First Republic, as they hoped for a strengthening of their position and the socialist cause within a Greater Germany. In the first elections for the constitutional national assembly on 16 February 1919, women were allowed to vote for the first time. The SDAPÖ became the strongest party and formed a grand coalition with the anti-Anschluss Christian Social Party (CS).\n\n On 5 January 1919, the German Workers' Party (DAP) was founded in Munich in the hotel Fürstenfelder Hof by Anton Drexler, along with Dietrich Eckart, Gottfried Feder and Karl Harrer. It developed out of the Freier Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league, a branch of which Drexler had founded in 1918. Thereafter in 1918, Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society), convinced Drexler and several others to form the Politischer Arbeiterzirkel (Political Workers' Circle). The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and antisemitism. Drexler was encouraged to form the DAP \n\nSudetendeutsches Freikorps, a German nationalist paramilitary that fought against Czechoslovakia for annexation of the Sudetenland into Germany. ; Free Corps Denmark, a Danish volunteer collaborationist group in the Waffen-SS that was founded by the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, and participated in the invasion of the Soviet Union. ; British Free Corps, a British collaborationist Waffen-SS unit made up of British and Dominion prisoners of war.

It is now the seat of the Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg. In 1222 Count Henry of Schwerin returned from a crusade with a reliquary of the Holy Blood, an alleged drop of Christ's blood contained in a jewel. This was placed in the cathedral, and caused it to become a place of pilgrimage. During the 14th century the nave and transept were completed, as well as the chapter buildings. At the end of the 15th century the cloister on the north side was finished. The tower, 117.5 metres high, was constructed between 1889 and 1893. It is the tallest church spire in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\n Mecklenburg is a region in northern Germany comprising the western and larger part of the present day state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Its largest cities are Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. In 1815, the two Mecklenburg duchies – Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz – were raised to Grand Duchies, and subsequently existed separately in Germany until the end of World War I. The earlier private railways were nationalised by 1890 into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway.\n\n After more than five years of dispute over succession to the House of Mecklenburg, the duchy was established in 1701 in the territory of the former duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. The Güstrow branch of the House of Mecklenburg had died out with the death of Duke Gustav Adolph in 1695. Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin claimed heirship, but he had to deal with the demands of his uncle Adolphus Frederick, husband of Mary of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the daughter of Gustav Adolph. The emissaries of the Lower Saxon Circle finally negotiated a compromise on March 8, 1701. The agreement created the final, definitive \n\n of Mecklenburg and was sealed with the 1701 Treaty of Hamburg. Section 2 of the treaty established Mecklenburg-Strelitz as a duchy in its own right and assigned it to Adolphus Frederick, together with the Principality of Ratzeburg on the western border of Mecklenburg south of Lübeck, the Herrschaft Stargard in the southeast of Mecklenburg, with the cities of Neubrandenburg, Friedland, Woldegk, Strelitz, Burg Stargard, Fürstenberg/Havel and Wesenberg, and the commandries of Mirow and Nemerow.

It consisted of the 1934-established Mecklenburg (a merger by the Nazi Gauleiter Friedrich Hildebrandt of the free states of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz) and parts of the former Prussian provinces of Pommern (Western Pomerania to the Oder–Neisse line) and Hanover (Amt Neuhaus).

The project has a target population of 5 million people by 2050, with the first phase of construction expected to house 50,000. The project's planners intend for the city to be built on desert land, with Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, and Appalachia proposed as potential locations. The name Telosa is derived from the Ancient Greek word telos, meaning \"higher purpose\". Lore announced he had hired the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) owned by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. The proposed land ownership in the city is inspired by Georgist principles, as advocated by political economist Henry George in his 1879 book Progress and Poverty. Under the proposed rules, anyone would be licensed to build, keep or sell a home, building or any other structure, but the city would retain ultimate ownership of the land.\n\n Southbank is a multi-building urban redevelopment project under construction in Chicago, being developed by Lendlease. The site was originally part of a larger development, dubbed \"Riverline\" built by a partnership between Chicago-based developer CMK and Lendlease but the partnership was dissolved in early 2018. Southbank neighbors the other descendant project, Riverline, which retained the original name. Groundbreaking occurred in 2016 when the partnership between CMK and Lendlease had not been dissolved. The development is north of The 78, another large-scale development. The first residential building in the complex will allow tenants to move in as early as October 2018. The building was originally known as Ancora at Riverline, but has been renamed The Cooper at Southbank.\n\nAs clinical trials grow in scope and complexity, VeraSci provides the scientific and operational clarity needed for optimal trial performance and accelerated drug development.

The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog. For example, upon meeting the top hat, the protagonist cries, \"Thunder of Sebastopole!\"; in another scene, he shouts, \"A thousand Potemkins!\" Other characters in the book are \"cutthroats\", \"brigands\", a \"fainting contessa\", and a \"dashing cadet\".

Steig was in his eighties when he wrote the book. His books became known for “graphically repeated themes of stark separation and warm reunion” between parents and their children while maintaining the \"wit\" that was characteristic of his cartoons. The books also commonly included themes such as separation and transformation.

He entered office at a period of change in the world; the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet Union came in his presidency. In his inaugural address, Bush said: \"I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over.

Instead his father tells him that fathers always love their children, and that such love is a \"love without end, Amen.\" In the second verse, the singer has now become a father, and he had no doubt that his son was \"just like (his) father's son\", and he passes his father's secret on to his son. In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven. When he has doubts if he will enter or not due to bad choices he has made in his life, a Voice from the \"Other Side\" reiterates the words His Father once said to Him, illustrating the ultimate \"Love Without End\".\n\n In March 2015, \"O Praise the Name (Anástasis)\" was released as a free download on Hillsong's website, and served as a single for Easter. David Ware served as vocalist for \"O Praise the Name\", while prominent worship leader Marty Sampson co-wrote the song. Sampson played the song for Hillsong global creative director Cass Langton, who was \"overwhelmed\" by the song, saying, \"The lyrics… they captivated me. The thoughts in the song opened my eyes again to the Gospel story, and I felt the emotions of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ all over again — I could hardly wait to hear our church worship to this song.\" On 14 \n\n Cory Asbury shared the story behind the song in an interview published on the Bethel Music website on January 23, 2020, saying: \"'The Father’s House' was born a couple of years ago during a tour I was on. We had a few days off in Redding, California and I went to a house that overlooks the Sacramento River where our team usually meets to write music. My soul felt tired and weary, and I sat down at the piano because music is therapy for me. I just poured it out before God and went nuts. I did this for 15-20 minutes until this song came out, 'You never want it perfect, you just want my heart.' — Cory Asbury\" Asbury added that during his hiatus, Benjamin Hastings had visited him at his home in Michigan and opined that the lyric was a verse, not a chorus, and from there on, began writing out the song.\n\n Hughes wrote the song in 1999 as a response to how he felt after reading Philippians 2. The passage speaks about Christ's humility and how He willingly left His throne in heaven, came to earth as a man, and sacrificed Himself on the cross all because of His love for us. With this passage in mind, he picked up his guitar and, as he sang, the words to the song flowed out, but he was not satisfied with the chorus and felt that it did not flow well with the song. For several months, he struggled with the chorus and even put the song aside for about six months before finally finishing it. However, he was still not confident in the chorus. It was not until he played this song at his home church Soul Survivor, and his pastor told him to play the song more often, that he realized the potential the song had. Since then, this song has spread and become widely known. Hughes himself said. \"No one has been more surprised than myself at seeing how God has used this worship song.\" The themes in the song are the life of Jesus, thankfulness, and worship.\n\n The Story is the second album by folk rock singer Brandi Carlile, and was released on April 3, 2007.

Locke's Two Treatises of Government published in 1689 was especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the \"consent of the governed\". In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in \"equality by creation\" and \"rights by creation\". Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The theory of the social contract influenced the belief among many of the Founders that the right of the people to overthrow their leaders was one of the \"natural rights\" of man, should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen.

The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the American revolutionaries in the run up to the American Revolution. The political tract Common Sense used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the British Empire, as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the Declaration of Independence of the United States, when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King George III. As the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were \"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\" and could alter or abolish government \"destructive\" of those rights.\n\n almost constant attendance; and also that the judges be made completely independent.\" Though he was in England at the time of the Anti-Federalist Papers, Thomas Paine, whose pamphlet Common Sense served as motivation for independence from British rule during the American Revolution, also opposed the unitary executive. While this position was already evidenced from his role as Clerk to the Pennsylvania Assembly during the writing of Pennsylvania's 1776 Constitution, he clearly stated it in a letter to George Washington in 1796. In this letter, Paine argued for a plural executive on the grounds that a unitary executive would become head of a party and that a republic should not debase itself by obeying an individual.\n\n10 January – American Revolution: Thomas Paine publishes his pamphlet Common Sense \"written by an Englishman\" in Philadelphia arguing for independence from British rule in the Thirteen Colonies. ; 27 February – American Revolution: at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, Scottish American Loyalists are defeated by North Carolina Patriots. ; 2&ndash;3 March – American Revolution: ; Battle of Nassau: The American Continental Navy and Marines make a successful assault on Nassau, Bahamas. ; Battle of the Rice Boats: American Patriots resist the Royal Navy on the Savannah River. British control over the Province of Georgia is lost. ; 9 March – economist Adam Smith publishes The Wealth \n\n Letters during the early 1700s, reprinted eagerly by American colonists who already were free of European aristocracy and feudal land monopolies. In January 1776, only two years after coming to America from England, Thomas Paine published his pamphlet Common Sense calling for independence for the colonies. Paine promoted liberal ideas in clear and concise language that allowed the general public to understand the debates among the political elites. Common Sense was immensely popular in disseminating these ideas, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. Paine would later write the Rights of Man and The Age of Reason and participate in the French Revolution. Paine's \n\n of society.\" \"Republican motherhood\" became the ideal for American women, exemplified by Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation. Thomas Paine published his pamphlet Common Sense in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to concurrently spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine presented the Revolution as the solution for Americans alarmed by the threat of tyranny.\n\nQuestion: Why is Common Sense, which was written by an author who encouraged revolt, an important work?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

John John, owner of tea estates, to the land revenue commissioner stated: \"During the last floods my tea estates, Karimkulam and Karimtharuvi, sustained heavy losses and I herewith enclose a statement showing the losses. This was mainly due to the indiscriminate working of the sluice valves of the Mullaperiyar Dam without giving any previous warning. The rainfall all over the country and especially in the Peermade District was unprecedented and the river was already in flood due to these rains and the partial opening of the sluice valves. Then it is said that the authorities found the water level in the lake had risen much over the maximum limit and they opened the sluices to the full height thereby flushing the river.\n\n  A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. In the sense of \"flowing water\", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases \n\n 1900s: Texas experienced a number of devastating floods in the early 1900s resulting in death and destruction due to rivers overflowing from heavy rainfalls. 1930s: United States government began approving and authorizing the building of dams along Texas rivers with the intention to absorb these floodwaters. 1940s: The plan to create the Whitney Reservoir (Lake Whitney) on the Brazos River for flood control and other purposes, such as hydro-electric power development, was approved and authorized by Congress in 1944. The dam construction started in 1947 and lasted four years. 1950s: In 1951, the lake was impounded. The dam's power plant was under construction from 1951 to 1953. After a record-breaking drought in Texas during the 1950s, there was an emphasis on reservoirs serving a secondary purpose, with the primary one being flood control, as water storage facilities for Texas residents, communities, businesses, agriculture, and others. Present: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to operate several flood control reservoirs within the Brazos River basin, including Lake Whitney.\n\n River, Quarry Park has been designed based on many flood mitigation strategies to ensure the community does not face devastation at the hands of flooding. The Bow River flooded in the spring of 2013, causing major damage to many areas in Calgary and its surrounding communities. Quarry Park, despite being located in an evacuation zone, remained completely dry. The engineers of Quarry Park studied polders extensively, which are low-lying areas near water and often found in the Netherlands and other seaside countries. Based on the engineering of polders, Quarry Park was built with an insulated, reinforced riprap berm designed to withstand a one-in-100 year flood event.

During the Twelfth Dynasty in the 19th century BC, the Pharaohs Senosert III, Amenemhat III, and Amenemhat IV dug a canal 16 km long linking the Fayum Depression to the Nile in Middle Egypt. Two dams called Ha-Uar running east-west were built to retain water during the annual flood and then release it to surrounding lands. The lake called Mer-wer or Lake Moeris covered 1700 sqkm and is known today as Birket Qarun. By the mid-late third millennium BC, an intricate water-management system in Dholavira in modern-day India was built. The system included 16 reservoirs, dams \n\n land encompasses large areas of the floodplain along the rivers, which are subject to seasonal flooding, often severe. These areas had previously been developed for residential and business uses, much of which were damaged or destroyed in the 1997 flood, with major property losses. To protect the communities, a massive new dike system was built. It required removal of several residential areas on both sides of the river, most of which had been inundated and severely damaged. The Greenway includes the area of floodplain between these new dikes and the rivers. Today, the Greenway serves the dual purpose of providing recreational opportunities throughout the year for metropolitan area residents, and being part of the regional flood prevention program. Its trees and greenery can absorb some of floodwaters naturally. The dikes provide another level of protection to hold back river waters from the built-up city areas beyond.\n\n Egyptian civilization has sustained itself utilizing water management and agriculture for some 5,000 years in the Nile River valley. The Egyptians practiced basin irrigation, a form of water management adapted to the natural rise and fall of the Nile River. Since around 3000 BCE, the Egyptians constructed earthen banks to form flood basins of various sizes that were regulated by sluices to floodwater into the basin where it would sit until the soil was saturated, the water was then drained, and crops planted. This method of agriculture did not deplete the soil of nutrients or cause salinization problems experienced by modern agricultural methods.\n\n the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use. The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley, and several \n\n  A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned. Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing \n\nQuestion: When does the river that the majority of Egyptians live near flood each year?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In his twenties he went to Jerusalem where he entered in the monastery of Saint Michel, a cloister associated with Mar Saba Monastery. After two years of prayer, he was asked by his bishop Simeon to return to Hama where he was ordained deacon and later priest. A few years later he moved for service to Aleppo where he got appraisal as preacher. On 12 February 1612 Karmah was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Aleppo by Patriarch Athanasius II Dabbas, and he took the name of the saint of that day, ‘’Meletios’’. One of his aims as metropolitan was to increase the literacy and the education of his flock and his presbyter, which needed liturgical and religious books in Arabic. \n\n Pope Simeon I of Alexandria (fl. 695), 42nd Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark. The first pope elected from among the Syrians to the See of St. Mark was Pope Simeon I. He was a monk in the Pateron Monastery (Deir Al-Zugag). The Synaxarium links Simeon to his Syrian heritage by mentioning to his readers that Severus of Antioch was buried in the monastery. The Synaxarium attests to his saintly life. There were two attempts to poison Pope Simeon and he survived both of them. Pope Simeon was a great reformer. He fought very fiercely against a new trend among Coptic men who began emulating the Arabs by taking more than one wife.\n\n Martyn was born in Truro, Cornwall, on 18 February 1781. His father, John Martyn, was a \"captain\" or mine-agent at Gwennap.

In 1802, he was chosen as a fellow of his college. He had intended to go to the bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, taking charge of the Cambridgeshire parish of Lolworth.\n\n column called \"Simeon Stylites\", named after Saint Simeon Stylites, a 5th-century ascetic who lived on top of a pillar for 39 years.

Encouraged by the Medinese elite including the companions like Talha, Zubayr, Amr ibn al-A's, the conqueror of Egypt whom Uthman had deposed, and Muhammad's widow A'isha, the provincial opposition subsequently broadened into open rebellion and dissidents from Egypt and Iraq marched on Medina, killing the caliph in June 656.

The best-documented claim (Xenophon) attributes the invention to the Persian King Cyrus the Great (550 BCE), who mandated that every province in his kingdom would organize reception and delivery of post to each of its citizens. He also negotiated with neighboring countries to do the same and had roads built from the city of Post in Western Iran all the way up to the city of Hakha in the East.

Mu'tazilite theologian and chronicler Al-Jahiz has once theorized that the Zubayrids possessed anti-dynastic views, and resented dynastic rule of Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, and even the imamate of Alids faction in Shiite. However, Majied Robinson recorded that the Zubayrids, particularly their genealogy scholars, have longwithstanding loyalty towards the Abbasd caliphate, as they have tendency to omit the names of their clansmen into anonymousity those who involved in rebellion towards the caliphate from their records.\n\n The tribe is named after Ju'fi ibn Sa'd al-'Ashirah ibn Madh'hij (جعفي بن سعد العشيرة بن مذحج) and Ju'fi had two sons: Marran and Harim.

After Islam, under the Rashidun Caliphate, the tribe immigrated in large numbers to the newly conquered Kufa in Iraq and settled there. The Ju'fi tribe played an important role in the early Umayyad Caliphate, and they are known to always favor the Umayyads side in conflicts. Many prominent figures are attributed to Banu Ju'fa tribe. For Example, a man from Ju'fa called Yazid al-Ju'fi is said to be the one where Yazidis derived the name from.

Frost's relationship to Thomas, as Hollis discusses, essentially saved Thomas' life. Their friendship serves as the heart of the book. Hollis details how the two poets spent hours \"talks-walking\", in Frost's words, around the bucolic \n\n In the story, the narrator recounts to an old flame a date they once had, whilst her husband was away, where they visited a friend, Pal Palych, in the country. From the very beginning, it is revealed that the narrator is an aesthetic individual, prone to epiphanies. For him, the world seems \"homogonous, congruent, bound by the laws of harmony\". Whereas the narrator is prone to communicate his epiphanies in the language of sound, the woman is \"habitually untalkative\". When the narrator must venture back to Palych's house to retrieve his date's cigarette-holder, he finds his friend bleary eyed and suggests that he get outside more. Towards the end, the woman tells the narrator that she'd leave her husband to be with him. The reader by now already suspects that something is up, as the narrator has revealed that he loves not only her, but the entire world: \"it was not you alone who were my lover but the entire earth\". In the end, the narrator rides his bicycle home, stopping along the way to sit on a park bench where he notices a woman he plans to talk to, as well as seeing Palych fishing.\n\n Much of the novel is set during the war in Afghanistan at the beginning of the century and the financial crisis of 2007–08. One September morning in 2008, an investment banker approaching forty, his career in collapse and his marriage unraveling, receives a surprise visitor at his townhouse in South Kensington. In the disheveled figure of a South Asian male carrying a backpack, the banker recognizes a long-lost friend, a mathematics prodigy who disappeared years earlier under mysterious circumstances. The friend has resurfaced to make a confession of unsettling power. The story ranges from Kabul to London, New York City, Islamabad, Dhaka, Oxford, and Princeton, NJ—and explores the questions of love, belonging, science, and war. At its heart is the friendship of two men and the betrayal of one by the other. Rahman has described the backbone of the novel as an exploration of how much we can rely on what we think we know? Reviewers have said that \"the book challenges any attempt at summary.\"\n\n In August 1998, three years after Carol Polsgrove described Lish's heavy editing of Raymond Carver's Neighbors and published a facsimile page showing the editing, The New York Times Magazine published an article by D.

The destruction of the KPA and the UN offensive into North Korea prompted China to intervene in the Korean War, and Chinese forces launched their Second Phase Offensive against the UN forces near the border during November 1950.

On the premise of fearing for its own security, China committed additional troops it had already moved to the border and began three offensives between October 1950 and January 1951 which pushed the UN forces south of the original border between North and South Korea along the 38th Parallel and captured Seoul. A fourth offensive in mid-February was blunted by UN forces in the Battle of Chipyong-ni and Third Battle of Wonju. At the end of February the UN launched a series of offensive operations, recapturing Seoul on 15 March and pushing the front line back northwards. In early April Operation Rugged established the front in a line that followed the lower Imjin river, then eastwards to the Hwacheon Reservoir and on to the Yangyang area on the east coast, known as the Kansas Line. The subsequent Operation Dauntless pushed out a salient between the Imjin river as it dog-legged north and the Hwacheon Reservoir, known as the Utah Line.\n\n Retreating from the north faster than they had counter-invaded, the Eighth Army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid December. UN morale hit rock bottom when Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident. Concurrent with the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River was the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which the PVA 9th Army Group initiated on 27 November.

On 27 September near Osan UN forces coming from Inchon linked up with UN forces that had broken out of the Pusan Perimeter and began a general counteroffensive. The North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) had been shattered and its remnants were fleeing back towards North Korea. The UN Command then decided to pursue the KPA into North Korea, completing their destruction and unifying the country. On 30 September Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces crossed the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between North and South Korea on the east coast of the Korean peninsula and this was followed by a general UN offensive into North Korea. Within one month UN forces were approaching the Yalu River, prompting Chinese intervention in the war.

Although the movement had a minor role in pre-war politics, the division between the communist North Korea and the anti-communist South Korea came to dominate Korean political life in the post-World War II era. North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, continues to be a Juche socialist state under the rule of the Workers' Party of Korea. In South Korea, the National Security Law has been used to criminalize advocacy of communism and groups suspected of alignment with North Korea. Due to end of economic aid from Soviet Union after its dissolution in 1991 and impractical ideological application of Stalinist policies in North Korea over years of economic slowdown in the 1980s and receding during the 1990s, North Korea replaced Communism with the Juche ideology in its 1992 and 1998 constitutional revisions for the personality cult of Kim's family dictatorship and (albeit reluctantly) opening of North Korean market economy reform, though it still retains a command economy with complete state control of industry and agriculture. North Korea maintains collectivized farms and state-funded education and healthcare.\n\n had become a Captain in the Red Army. His battalion arrived in Pyongyang just as the Soviets were looking for a suitable person who could assume a leading role in North Korea. On October 13, 1945 the North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea was established. Though technically under the control of the Seoul-based party leadership, the North Korean Bureau had little contact with Seoul and worked closely with the Soviet Civilian Authority. The first chairman of the Bureau was Kim Yong-bom who had been sent to Korea by the Comintern in the 1930s to conduct underground activity. Kim \n\n The Kim family has ruled North Korea since 1948 for three generations, and still little about the family is publicly confirmed. Kim Il-sung rebelled against Japan's rule of Korea in the 1930s, which led to his exile in the Soviet Union. Korea was divided after Japan's defeat in World War II. Kim came to lead the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea (a Soviet-backed provisional government), becoming the first premier of its new government, the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (commonly known as North Korea), in 1948. Hoping to reunify the peninsula, on 25 June 1950 the North Korean KPA crossed the 38th Parallel, sparking the Korean War, which ended in \n\n  Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own ideology, leading to Korea's division into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea. In the North, a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, Kim Il-sung gained power through Soviet support. In the South, elections supervised by the United Nations were held, a Republic of Korea was declared, and Syngman Rhee inaugurated as its first president. In December, the UN General Assembly declared this \"a lawful government\" \n\n \"the only such government in Korea.\" The United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) from Japan after World War II. After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict that continued until 1953.

UN morale hit rock bottom when Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident. Concurrent with the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River was the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which the PVA 9th Army Group initiated on 27 November. Here the UNC forces fared comparatively better: like the Eighth Army the surprise attack also forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were in the process able to breakout from the \n\n a dividing line. Japanese troops north of the line were to surrender to the Soviet Union, and troops south of the line would surrender to the United States. The partition was not originally intended to last long, but Cold War politics resulted in the establishment of two separate governments in the two zones in 1948, and rising tensions prevented co-operation. The desire for many Koreans was for a peaceful unification but was dashed when the Korean War broke out in 1950. On 25 June 1950, troops from North Korea invaded South Korea. Mao Zedong encouraged the confrontation with the United States and Joseph Stalin reluctantly supported the invasion. After three years of fighting, which involved both Koreas, China and United Nations forces, the last of which were led by the US, the war ended with an armistice agreement at approximately the same boundary.\n\n 19 October, the Chinese launched their first offensive of the war on 25 October. Undeterred, UN Commander Douglas MacArthur initiated the Home-by-Christmas offensive aimed at unifying Korea. In response, the Chinese launched their Second Phase Offensive on 25 November that forced the UN forces to retreat from North Korea in December 1950, carrying the war back south of the 38th Parallel, with Seoul being abandoned to the PVA/KPA on 4 January 1951. Reeling from these defeats, the UN Command sought to commence ceasefire negotiations with the Chinese government in January 1951, but Mao Zedong and his colleagues ardently refused; as a result, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 498 on 1 February, condemning China as an aggressor, and demanded that its forces withdraw from Korea.\n\n The UN retreat from North Korea was the withdrawal of United Nations (UN) forces from North Korea that took place from 2–25 December 1950. On 30 September Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces crossed the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between North and South Korea on the east coast of the Korean peninsula and this was followed by a general UN offensive into North Korea to pursue the shattered North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA). Within one month UN forces were approaching the Yalu River prompting Chinese intervention in the war.

On 27 September near Osan UN forces coming from Inchon linked up with UN forces that had broken out of the Pusan Perimeter and began a general counteroffensive. The North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) had been shattered and its remnants were fleeing back towards North Korea. The UN Command then decided to pursue the KPA into North Korea, completing their destruction and unifying the country. On 30 September Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces crossed the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between North and South Korea on the east coast of the Korean peninsula and this was followed by a general UN offensive into North Korea. Within one month UN forces were approaching the Yalu River, prompting Chinese intervention in the war. Despite the initial Chinese attacks in late October-early November, the UN renewed their offensive on 24 November before it was abruptly halted by massive Chinese intervention in the Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November.\n\nQuestion: Who led North Korea in to the war where UN troops approached the Yalu river.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Soviet Union also withdrew their soldiers from Korea in 1949, but continued to supply North Korea with military aid. On June 25, 1950, Kim Il-sung's Korean People's Army invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts. The Soviet Union was not directly involved, though Kim did win Stalin's approval before launching the invasion. Truman, meanwhile, did not view Korea itself as a vital region in the Cold War, but he believed that allowing a Western-aligned country \n\n On November 29, 1952, the US president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to see how to end the Korean War. With the UN's acceptance of India's proposed armistice, the ceasefire of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), and the UN Command had the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel north. These parties signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, to end the fighting. South Korean President Syngman Rhee attacked the peace proceedings and did not sign the armistice. Upon agreeing to the ceasefire agreement, which called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China, and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. the principal belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and the joint Republic of Korea Army, US, and UN Command. The war is considered to have ended at that point even though there still is no peace treaty.\n\n The Korean War was a military conflict between the South Korea and North Korea that started on June 25, 1950. Although armed hostilities ended with the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, the ceasefire was not a treaty under international law and so a technical state of war remains. The United States led the UN coalition supporting the South Korea, and the Soviet Union and Communist China supported North Korea. The Korean War was the first armed conflict and proxy war of the Cold War and escalated tensions between the West and the East. In September 1949, the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb, which made a limited war virtually impossible. Fears of communism had \n\n In an effort to force nations to resolve issues without warfare, framers of the United Nations Charter attempted to commit member nations to using warfare only under limited circumstances, particularly for defensive purposes. The UN became a combatant itself after North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, which begun the Korean War. The UN Security Council condemned the North Korean action by a 9–0 resolution (with the Soviet Union absent) and called upon its member nations to come to the aid of South Korea. The United States and 15 other nations formed a \"UN force\" to pursue this action. In a press conference on 29 June 1950, U.S. President Harry S. Truman characterized these hostilities as not being a \"war\" but a \"police action\". The United Nations has issued Security Council Resolutions that declared some wars to be legal actions under international law, most notably Resolution 678, authorizing the 1991 Gulf War which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. UN Resolutions authorise the use of \"force\" or \"all necessary means\".\n\n to China. After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950. Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan. The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch'ongch'on River, while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory. It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow \n\nQuestion: During which span of years was the war where UN troops approached the Yalu River?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Merrell opened the Western Market Drug Store at Sixth Street and Western Row (now Central Avenue) in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.  Merrell expanded into the wholesale drug business.  Following his death in 1880 his sons formed the William S. Merrell Chemical Company.\n\nIn the 1930s, it merged with a company started by Lunsford Richardson to become Richardson-Merrell.

Merrell Chemical Company led by Frank Palopoli synthesized clomifene in 1956 (to stimulate ovulation); after its biological activity was confirmed a patent was filed and issued in November 1959.  Scientists at Merrell had previously synthesized chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol.\n\nThalidomide\nOne of Richardson-Merrell's best-known incidents revolved around its efforts to introduce thalidomide into the US market in the 1950s and 1960s under the brand name \"Kevadon\". The drug was already highly popular in Europe as a sedative and antiemetic for elderly patients. Although neither tested nor approved for use during pregnancy, its effectiveness and absence of significant side-effects led many physicians to prescribe it to pregnant women.  Richardson-Merrell submitted their new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 8, 1960. During the application process, Richardson-Merrell asked the FDA for quick approval of the drug, and distributed 2.5 million tablets of thalidomide to 1,200 American doctors with the understanding that the drug was under investigation, a preemptive marketing strategy that was permissible at the time under existing regulations. Nearly 20,000 patients received the drug. Reviewing pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey, who had joined the FDA just a month before the application's arrival, repeatedly denied the company's requests for permission to market the drug, citing an insufficient number of controlled studies to establish risks. When studies revealed that 10,000 children worldwide had been born with severe birth defects from the drug, Merrell withdrew its application and recalled the remaining unconsumed tablets from doctors offices around the country. Ultimately, 17 children in the United States were born with defects. For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President John F. Kennedy.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals\nDow Chemical acquired controlling interest of the Merrell pharmaceutical division of Richardson-Merrell company in 1980 and it became Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe former Richardson-Merrell became Richardson-Vicks, Inc.

A recipe for pound cake is in the first U.S. cookbook, American Cookery, which was published in 1796. Over time the ingredients for pound cake changed. Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of Direction for Cookery, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges. This changed the flavor and texture of the cake. In the 2008 issue of Saveur, James Villas wrote that cake flour would not work in place of all-purpose flour because it lacks the strength to support the heavy batter. An early variation on this cake replaced some of the flour with cornmeal made from dried corn (maize), which was then called Indian meal. A recipe for Indian pound cake was first published in 1828 by Eliza Leslie and later included in The Indian Meal Book, which was published in London in 1846, when people in Ireland were looking for alternatives to expensive wheat flour.\n\nQuestion: What was the percentage the Dow Jones fell during the time the first cake mix come out?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The character first appeared in Jackpot Comics #5 (cover dated Spring 1942). He received his own self-titled ongoing comic book series in 1950 which ran on and off until September 1980. A second series began publication in December 2016, being set in Archie Comics New Riverdale universe with a new character design aesthetic and a more mature story format and scripting, aimed for older, contemporary teenage and young adult readers. Even the printed comic book format is different from the previous publications.\n\n In the mid 1970s, two live-action specials of Archie and the Archie characters were aired on U.S. television. \"Archie,\" which aired on December 19, 1976, was a one-hour pilot episode as part of the ABC Saturday Comedy Special, and \"The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show,\" a TV Movie, which aired on August 5, 1978. Both specials featured the same actors cast in their respective roles. In 1990, NBC aired Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again (titled Archie: Return to Riverdale on video), a TV movie featuring Christopher Rich as a 30-something Archie Andrews who returns to his hometown for a high school reunion, and reunites with Betty, Veronica, and several other original comic book characters.\n\nIn a The Simpsons comic, Archie appears in a flashback of Homer's teenage years, holding a sign that says \"Riverdale\". ; In 1954, Mad Magazine released the comic story Starchie, whose characters Starchie, Bottleneck, Biddy and Salonica were clear parodies of the Archie Comics teenagers. It has been reprinted numerous times. \n\nIn the Seinfeld episode \"The Wink\", Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George were once referred to as 'Archie', 'Veronica', 'Jughead' and 'Mr. Weatherbee' respectively ; In an episode of Hey Arnold!, Helga mentions Jughead. Also Harold Berman originally had a crown beanie resembling that of Jughead. ; In Ed, Ed's friend compares him to Archie. ; In Corner Gas, the characters compare themselves to the Archies and later dress up as them. \n\nIn 1998, director Tommy O'Haver was hired by Universal to write and direct a big-budget Archie movie, but the project never went before the cameras. ; In the 1985 feature film Police Academy 2, Officer Mahoney goes undercover to infiltrate a gang that is taking over their city. When first making contact with members of the gang, he claims that his name is Jughead and that he runs with a gang called The Archies. ; The 1970s soft-core porn movie Hot Times was loosely based on the Archie characters. ; In Chasing Amy, two characters argue over the sexual orientation of Archie, one claiming he is gay, the other that he is straight. ; In The Right Stuff, Gus Grissom wryly refers to fellow future Mercury astronauts John Glenn and Scott Carpenter as \"Archie and Jughead\" due to their friendly sense of competition during the grueling testing sessions conducted by government medical personnel. \n\nQuestion: What line by a cast member of Doing His Bit is believed to have started the archie nickname?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She described the writing process for the song as \"fun\" and that the hook was inspired by an idiom often used by her mom and grandma (\"it will all come out in the wash\") that she felt described getting \"over the hump\" after her last record which took her through a lot of personal trials and tribulations: \"I think that it's got some sarcasm to it, but it's very honest. I haven't had a single out in a long time, and I'm just ready to have new music. I'm in a new phase of my life and ready to have new music out there that represents that,\" she explained. \"This one just felt perfect as far as the vibe of it.

Several songs by Delta Rae have been inspired by Hölljes' romantic pursuits, including \"Fire\" and \"Do You Ever Dream?.\" \"Fire\" describes an ex-boyfriend who \"had a bad habit of telling strangers about our relationship problems,\" while \"Do You Ever Dream\" depicts an ex who didn't share Hölljes' \"imagination or vision for the future.\" In February 2020, Delta Rae released \"From One Woman to Another,\" which is the first song that Hölljes took the lead on writing for the band. She said she wrote the song \"not to chastise folx looking for a casual connection, but to say to those holding out for love: Let go of the people not meant for you, make room for a true love to come along and know you're not alone.\"\n\n Sleeping with Sirens is an American rock band from Orlando, Florida, currently residing in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I got into writing it, and started with the lyrics, I remembered the first time I heard 'Sweet Home Alabama,' and I was just mesmerized with it.

Many recipes found online use a cake mix instead of a cake batter from scratch. While more convenient, it doesn't necessarily deliver the same result. The homemade or \"made from scratch\" cake recipes tend to yield a cake with a much denser crumb than what you'd normally get when using a store-bought mix, which ends up performing better especially after being mixed with homemade frosting. The denser cake is stiffer, making it easier to shape the balls and attach the sticks. Store bought mix yields a lighter cake that doesn't harden as much, and the sticks tend to slip out after attached. Once the cake has been baked, or when \n\n Bumpy Cake was created by Sanders Confectionery, of Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1900s and was originally known as \"The Sanders Devil's Food Buttercream Cake\" when it was first introduced. It is made of chocolate devil's food cake that is topped with rich buttercream bumps, and then draped in a chocolate ganache. Now more than a century old, this is a classic confection. Sanders Confectionery makes the original trademarked Bumpy Cake, but other companies have attempted to use this trademarked name many times during the cake's 100-year-plus history. In recipes adapted for the home kitchen it can be made by piping the buttercream frosting in thick half-inch \n\n 1975 when \"the AP newspaper published an interview with a baker that worked making them for a small fee of $2,000. They were built around huge cylinders that could house an adult.\" Nowadays, the construction is generally made of corrugated cardboard, often covered with whipped cream or frosting to make them look real. This kind of pop out cakes present the advantages of being cheaper to build and easier to move, due to their lightness, but they are also much more fragile and should be handled with care.

When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy soft peaks. The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder. The filling ingredients can be chopped in an electric \n\n It is believed that the pound cake is of northern European origin and dates back to the early 1700s.

He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.  The conflict \n\n Upon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the former Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it. Johnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be \n\n Confederate States of America, including Tennessee, but Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as Military Governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson was a logical choice as running mate for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; and became vice president after a victorious election in 1864. Johnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction, a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform \n\n As the Civil War broke out, Van Dorn enlisted in the Confederate cause. He resigned his U.S. Army commission, which was accepted effective January 31, 1861. He was appointed a brigadier general in the Mississippi Militia on January 23. In February he replaced Jefferson Davis as major general and commander of Mississippi's state forces after Davis was selected as the Confederacy's President. After resigning from the Mississippi Militia on March 16, 1861, Van Dorn entered the Regular Confederate States Army as a colonel of infantry on that same date. He was sent west to raise and lead a volunteer brigade within the new Confederate Department of Texas. On April 11 he was given command of Confederate forces in Texas, and was also \n\n On January 31, 1865, the 2nd Confederate States Congress provided “for the appointment of a General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States.” On February 6, General Robert E. Lee was appointed to the position and served in that capacity until the end of the American Civil War. Lee retained command of the Army of Northern Virginia, serving in both assignments de facto until April 9, 1865, when he surrendered to Federal forces at Appomattox, Virginia. The appointment of a General in Chief had been debated as early as February 27, 1862. President Jefferson Davis voiced his rejection (and veto) of creating this position to the 1st Confederate States Congress on March 14, 1862, believing that such a general could \"command an army or armies without the will of the President.\" Davis performed many of the responsibilities of a general in chief himself throughout the war, acting as both a military operations manager and commander-in-chief. Lee (from March to May 1862) and General Braxton Bragg (from February 1864 to January 1865) also performed related duties, as they were military advisers to Davis, or \"charged with the conduct of military operations in the armies of the Confederacy.\"\n\nQuestion: When did the president of the Confederate States of America end his fight in the Mexican-American war?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the United States Army and United States Navy who had resigned their Federal commissions and were appointed to senior positions. Many had served in the Mexican–American War (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as Leonidas Polk (who graduated from West Point but did not serve in the Army) had little or no experience. The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges \n\n Initially, Lee did not intend to surrender but planned to regroup at the village of Appomattox Court House, where supplies were to be waiting and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After an initial battle, Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the McLean House. In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword \n\n The General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States, or simply General in Chief, was the commanding general and head of the Confederate States Army from February to April 1865. The office was effectively abolished on April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Federal forces at Appomattox, Virginia. Despite being the General in chief, Lee was not the highest ranking Confederate general officer.\n\n Charles Henry Lee ( – 2 October 1782) served as a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He also served earlier in the British Army during the Seven Years War. He sold his commission after the Seven Years War and served for a time in the Polish army of King Stanislaus II Augustus. Lee moved to North America in 1773 and bought an estate in western Virginia. When the fighting broke out in the American War of Independence in 1775, he volunteered to serve with rebel forces. Lee's ambitions to become Commander in Chief of the Continental Army were thwarted by the appointment of George Washington to that post. In 1776, forces under his command repulsed a British attempt to capture Charleston, which boosted his standing with the army and Congress. Later that year, he was captured by British cavalry under Banastre Tarleton; he was held by the British as a prisoner until exchanged in 1778. During the Battle of Monmouth later that year, Lee led an assault on the British that miscarried. He was subsequently court-martialed and his military service brought to an end. He died in Philadelphia in 1782.\n\n Albert Sidney Johnston (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a general in three different armies: the Texian Army, the United States Army, and the Confederate States Army. He saw extensive combat during his 34-year military career, fighting actions in the Black Hawk War, the Texas War of Independence, the Mexican–American War, the Utah War, and the American Civil War. Considered by Confederate States President Jefferson Davis to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of Robert E. Lee, he was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking Confederate officer killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of General Johnston \"was the turning point of our fate.\" Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general Joseph E.

Soon, Johnston enlisted in the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles as a private, leaving Warner's Ranch May 27. He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas, crossing the Colorado River into the Confederate Territory of Arizona on July 4, 1861. His escort was commanded by Alonzo Ridley, Undersheriff of Los Angeles, who remained at Johnston's side until he was killed. Early in the Civil War, Confederate President Jefferson Davis decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible, and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts. In the summer of 1861, Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains.

His appointment as a brigadier general was refused by the Confederate Senate after Confederate President Jefferson Davis failed to nominate Taylor, apparently following Davis's appointment of Taylor to the rank. Nonetheless, Taylor's name is frequently found on lists and in sketches of Confederate generals. He was often referred to as a general both during the Civil War and the years following it. Before the Civil War, Taylor served as a first lieutenant in the 3rd Kentucky Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Mexican–American War. After that war, he was a cattle driver, farmer and lawyer. After the Civil War, he was engaged in business in Mobile, Alabama for five years, and after returning to Kentucky, was a Deputy U.S. Marshal for five years and was chief of police at Louisville, Kentucky for eleven years.\n\n but after four months’ service resigned. Davis served as colonel of the Second Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers in the Mexican–American War. After the war, he was a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives 1855–1857. He was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth Congresses and served from March 4, 1857, to January 12, 1861, when he withdrew. During the American Civil War, Davis served in the Confederate Army as brigadier general. After the war, he resumed the practice of law. He was an unsuccessful Greenback candidate for the Forty-sixth Congress in 1878. During this period he purchased a Greek Revival style house in Aberdeen, Mississippi, known as Sunset Hill, and wrote his Recollections of Mississippi and Mississippians. He died suddenly, while in Huntsville, Alabama in 1890 and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Aberdeen.\n\n Albert Sidney Johnston (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a general in three different armies: the Texian Army, the United States Army, and the Confederate States Army. He saw extensive combat during his 34-year military career, fighting actions in the Black Hawk War, the Texas War of Independence, the Mexican–American War, the Utah War, and the American Civil War. Considered by Confederate States President Jefferson Davis to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of Robert E. Lee, he was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking Confederate officer killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of General Johnston \"was the turning point of our fate.\" Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston.\n\n The Mexican–American War broke out in 1846. Lane resigned his State Senate seat, and enlisted in a company of Indiana volunteers. His company was assigned to the 2nd Indiana Volunteer Regiment, and Lane was elected colonel in June 1846. He was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers less than a week later. Lane and the Indiana troops were then deployed to Mexico where he fought with distinction, suffering two minor gunshot wounds, and was brevetted to major general in 1847. He commanded the Indiana Brigade at the Battle of Buena Vista, where he served under General and future President Zachary Taylor. Lane also led the relief force which lifted the Siege of Puebla, defeating Antonio López de Santa Anna at the Battle of Huamantla. \n\nQuestion: When did the president of the Confederacy end his fight in the Mexican-American war?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution. These states agreed to form a new federal government, the Confederate States of America, on February 4, 1861. They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President James Buchanan, whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the Dred Scott decision was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union \"was intended to be perpetual\", \n\n to point to any other local issue but slavery and say that Southerners would have seceded and fought over it.\" However, Davis contrasted the motivations of the Confederate leadership with that of the motivations for individual men for fighting in the Confederate army, writing that \"The widespread northern myth that the Confederates went to the battlefield to perpetuate slavery is just that, a myth. Their letters and diaries, in the tens of thousands, reveal again and again that they fought and died because their Southern homeland was invaded and their natural instinct was to protect home and hearth.\" 2000s In 2000, Davis became a professor at Virginia Tech, where he serves as director of programs for the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies.

The death of his elder brother Prince Gonthier in 1833 put Charles Gonthier in direct line for the throne. As such, upon the abdication of his grandfather, Prince Gonthier Frederick Charles I, on 19 August 1835, he became Hereditary Prince and heir apparent to his father, who became Prince Gonthier Frederick Charles II. In 1850 Prince Charles Gonthier enrolled at the University of Bonn to begin his studies in law and literature.

The program prepares student nurses to succeed and becomes a foundation for a lifelong learning career.\nOur nationally recognized nursing program graduates more than 150 BSN students each year. We offer exciting cultural immersion clinical experiences in places such as Mexico; Harlaxton, England; and South Dakota. Nearly 100 percent of our graduates have jobs or are continuing their education within one year of graduation.\nAt UW-Eau Claire you can obtain a graduate degree in nursing and receive advanced role preparation as a clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, nurse administrator or nurse educator.\nNote: CNA certification is a prerequisite to NRSG 267, a sophomore nursing clinical course. Admitted students should have wireless laptop access.\nIn the pre-nursing curriculum (one academic year), students complete at least 30 semester credits with courses in general chemistry, biochemistry, anatomy and physiology, and microbiology. These prerequisite courses can be taken at a variety of institutions. Undergraduate program plans have been developed for three campuses in the Marshfield area: UW-Stevens Point, UW-Marshfield/Wood County, and UW-Marathon County. Students must determine that courses they plan to take will transfer into UW-Eau Claire as equivalent to required courses. Students should contact Dr. Rachel Merkel (see contact information listed on this page) before beginning their course work to plan for integration and equivalency of the courses required at UW-Eau Claire. The program plans are developed for full-time study; however, pre-nursing courses can be completed as a part-time student.\nThe professional curriculum includes 60 credits in nursing courses (in three academic years). Students under faculty supervision gain experience in places such as hospitals, short-term rehabilitation facilities, community/public health agencies, ambulatory care facilities, schools, and nursing homes. Students must be full-time while completing the professional curriculum. Students at the Marshfield site receive the same high quality education as those enrolled at the main campus in Eau Claire.\nBeen accepted as a pre-nursing student to the university in good standing.\nCompleted at least 30 semester credits, not including courses for nursing assistant certification, with a total grade-point average of at least a 3.0 (includes transfer credits).\nCompleted at least three required natural science courses, two of which are laboratory science courses, with a grade-point average of at least 2.50.\nEarned a \"C\" in all required pre-nursing courses.\nSubmitted a non-refundable application fee.\nNOTE: The College of Nursing and Health Sciences may find it necessary to deny admission to a qualified applicant because of enrollment limits in the professional program. Depending on the number of qualified applicants, it is likely that the GPA required to be competitive for admission may be well above the 3.00 minimum cumulative GPA. Because nursing is a professional discipline, students must anticipate some additional expenses related to the nursing program (see Catalog). Also, textbook costs can be high, particularly in the early nursing courses; however, many books continue to be utilized in subsequent semesters.\n\n With the growing popularity of intercollegiate athletics in the early 1890s, the University of Michigan faculty in 1894 established a faculty Board in Control of Athletics. Pattengill was a member of the Athletic Board from the time of its formation, serving as its chairman from 1898 until the time of his death. He was also one of the leaders in the formation in 1896 of the Western Inter-Collegiate Athletic Conference (later known as the Big Ten Conference). The conference was composed of representatives from the athletic boards of seven leading Mid-Western universities, established with the goal of regulating and standardizing the conditions of inter-collegiate athletics and \"to maintain a high ideal of amateurism in college sports.\" Professor Pattengill worked with Michigan's President James B. Angell on the formation of the conference and served as Michigan's faculty representative to the conference. He also served as Chairman of the Western Conference for a number of years.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mascot of the university related to Randy Conrads?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There, he was further influenced by the landscape painter Hippolyte Boulenger, who took him on a tour of the Sonian Forest in Tervuren. In 1864, an economic depression resulted in the loss of his family fortune and he had to depend entirely upon painting for his income. Despite this, he remained restless and spent the years 1867–1868 exploring Brittany and the shores of the English Channel. When he returned home, he became one of the sixteen co-founders the Société Libre des Beaux-Arts, an association opposed to the stylistic hegemony of the academies and salons.

The following year, he turned more to oil painting and exhibited widely throughout France, notably in Lyon. In 1847, he visited Algeria and achieved a Gold Medal at the Salon in 1848 for his painting \"Battle of the Romulus\". This recognition was a major factor in his receiving a Professorship at the \"École de la Marine de Toulon\" in 1849. Three years later, he was awarded the Légion d’Honneur. He was named Honorary Director of the Musée d'art de Toulon in 1857 and, five years later, was admitted into the Félibrige (an Occitan cultural association) by its founder, Frédéric Mistral. The following year, at the age of 53, he married one of his students. He continued to exhibit and travel widely for many years (including a trip to Egypt in 1866).

The painting records the funeral in September 1848 of his great-uncle in the painter's birthplace, the small town of Ornans. It treats an ordinary provincial funeral with unflattering realism, and on the giant scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of history painting. Its exhibition at the 1850–51 Paris Salon created an \"explosive reaction\" and brought Courbet instant fame. It is currently displayed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France. The Salon found Courbet triumphant with The Stone Breakers, the Peasants of Flagey, and A Burial At Ornans.

One of Courbet's most famous paintings is Burial at Ornans, which records the burial of his great uncle in September 1848. Courbet's painting depicted actual people who had attended the funeral and were used as models for the painting. The mathematician and instrument maker Pierre Vernier, for whom the eponymous scale is named, was also a native of this small town (19 August 1580 -14 September 1637). The main avenue of Ornans bears his name, Rue Pierre Vernier.

The first \"sampan\" was credited to Hilo taxi driver Fukumatsu Kusumoto, who converted a Ford in 1922 by expanding the passenger compartment and installing wooden benches. Most sampans retained the passenger compartment from the back of the driver's seat forward; the remainder of the body was cut away and replaced with a homebuilt open-sided bed with a canvas roof, accommodating approximately twelve passengers on longitudinal benches. In Hawaiian, sampan buses are called kaa huli aku huli mai, the 'face one another' bus, after the bench seating arrangements. A 1971 article promoting tourism to the island called them \"as anachronistic and beloved as San Francisco's cable cars.\" In the late 1930s, sampan bus fares dropped from 15 cents \n\n  Tribal legends of volcanoes abound from the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Americas, usually invoking the forces of the supernatural or the divine to explain the violent outbursts of volcanoes. Taranaki and Tongariro, according to Māori mythology, were lovers who fell in love with Pihanga, and a spiteful jealous fight ensued. Māori will not to this day live between Tongariro and Taranaki for fear of the dispute flaring up again.

Pele was used for various scientific terms as for Pele's hair, Pele's tears, and Limu o Pele \n\n transportation system was officially launched on November 29, 1973 with a bus that ran from Waiohinu to Hilo, after being championed by Hawaii County Councilman (and eventual County Mayor) Dante Carpenter. The new service was named \"Hele On\" after a Pidgin Hawaiian phrase meaning \"to get out of here\" or \"to move along\". Olan Carpenter, wife of Dante, came up with the name. The service's first logo was a blue circle with a tire track in the center and two bare, yellow feet on either side of the track, devised by Colleen Shimazu. In 1975, the Mass Transit Agency (MTA) bought out and shut down the sampan system, then began providing public transportation services for the County of \n\n Waiākea High School is a public, co-educational secondary school in Hilo, Hawaii.

Berruguete most famously created paintings of the first few years of the Inquisition and of religious imagery for Castilian retablos. He is considered by some as the first Renaissance painter in Spain. He was the father of Alonso Berruguete, considered the most important sculptor of the Spanish Renaissance. Because of the fame accrued by Alonso, Pedro Berruguete is sometimes referred to as Berruguete el Viejo (\"Berruguete the Older\") to differentiate between the two.

Mouly learned from Lipchitz, particularly about the style of cubism. By the mid-1940s, Mouly's art began to gain notoriety from his peers and collectors. In 1945, his paintings were exhibited alongside the paintings of Matisse in the Salon d'Automne in Paris. The following year he moved to La Ruche where he became friends with Picasso, Chagall, and Klein, and exhibited at the Salon du Mai. Mouly's first one-person exhibition was held in 1949 at the Libraire Bergamasque. Mouly's style was influenced by the deep, bold colors typically used in Matisse's fauvist works, and by the cubism of Picasso. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Mouly created many lithographs.\n\n Born in the Siberian city of Tomsk, the only daughter of a pediatrician, Delectorskaya was orphaned at twelve, when both parents died in successive epidemics of typhus and cholera. Brought up by her aunt, they fled from the Russian revolution of 1917 to Manchuria, China. Lydia wanted to become a doctor, and was accepted in the medical faculty of the Sorbonne, but the high fees charged to foreign students were out of reach and she ended up a penniless exile in Nice. The first paintings Matisse made of Lydia combined the phenomenal virtuosity that had cost him so many years to perfect with his original instinctive ability to compose spontaneously in color. Matisse's son Pierre told his father that he had renewed himself as a painter with Pink Nude, for which Lydia modeled over a period of six months in 1935.\n\n Braque's earliest works were impressionistic, but after seeing the work exhibited by the artistic group known as the \"Fauves\" (Beasts) in 1905, he adopted a Fauvist style. The Fauves, a group that included Henri Matisse and André Derain among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists Raoul Dufy and Othon Friesz, who shared Braque's hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to L'Estaque, to Antwerp, and home to Le Havre to paint. In May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the Salon des Indépendants. The same year, Braque's style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by Paul Cézanne who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne greatly affected the avant-garde artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.\n\n Henri Émile Benoît Matisse (31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso, as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. The intense colorism of the works he painted between 1900 and 1905 brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves (wild beasts). Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so \n\n Matisse was born in Le Cateau-Cambrésis, in the Nord department in Northern France, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant. He grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, Picardie, France. In 1887, he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambrésis after gaining his qualification. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of appendicitis. He discovered \"a kind of paradise\" as he later described it, and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father. In 1891, he returned to Paris to \n\nQuestion: When was the painter of Femme nue couchée born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The painting depicts three naked babies who, with the help of sticks, try to roll a large ball through the hoop. A winged woman, lost in thought, is slicing a cane, perhaps intending to make another hoop. She is the personification of melancholy, similar to the winged genius from the engraving of the same name by Dürer, executed 18 years before the painting of Cranach. According to the ideals of the Renaissance, the whole world was based on analogies. So, melancholy at that time was associated with Saturn, a dog, carpentry. Many details of the picture are a reference to these analogies: the jump of witches in a black cloud, and an army in which soldiers fall from their horses.\n\n Jerusalem, with elements of Romanesque architecture.

The older girl on the left of the picture is holding a resplendent quetzal, and other specimens are scattered about. The attitude of the children ranges from the enthralled interest of the youngest two to the comparative indifference, almost boredom, of the oldest girl. The work was inspired by a visit that Millais and his son John Guille Millais paid to the ornithologist John Gould shortly before his \n\n Cornelia de Rijck (11 October 1653 &ndash; 4 October 1726) was a Dutch painter specialized in painting birds and insects. She was born in Amsterdam as the daughter of Dirck Jansz. de Rijck and Ariaantje Wessels. She married Gerrit van Goor in 1688, followed by a second marriage to Simon Schijnvoet in 1697. Her first husband was a portrait painter who painted her portrait, and together they taught the artist Gerrit Rademaker who continued to follow lessons from her as a widow. She is known for her meticulous studies of insects, 116 of which are in a portfolio in the Stockholm archives. Her paintings have been compared to that of Melchior d'Hondecoeter. She died in Amsterdam.\n\n A Young Lady in 1866 or Lady with a Parakeet is an 1866 painting by Édouard Manet, showing his favourite model Victorine Meurent, wearing a pink gown, holding a small bouquet of violettes and accompanied by a parakeet. It is an oil painting on canvas measuring 185.1 x 128.6 cm, and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It and Boy Carrying a Sword were the first of Manet's works to enter a gallery collection. It was first exhibited in the May 1867 exhibition of his works on the Avenue de l'Alma (now the Avenue George-V) in Paris as catalogue number 15, with the title Jeune dame en 1866. At the 1868 Paris Salon, the work's realism and inclusion of a parakeet was reminiscent of Gustave Courbet's 1866 Woman with a Parrot (Metropolitan Museum of Art), a nude which had caused a scandal at that year's Salon. Manet's work was similarly criticised and the public came to nickname it Lady with a Parakeet, although it had been exhibited as Lady in Pink, then as A Young Lady or Young Lady in 1866.\n\nQuestion: What is the date of birth of the 'Woman with a Parrot' creator?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This was a time of intense political and social activity in India. Jawaharlal Nehru who later become the first prime minister of India had become a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress which was demanding and fighting for complete political independence from the British occupation. This was also a time when Mahatma Gandhi briefly resigned from the Indian National Congress, Subhash Bose (popularly referred to as 'Netaji') had strong philosophical clashes with Mahatma Gandhi, and the struggle for independence became much stronger than in the past. From 1935 to 1947 when India finally got independence, Ram Prakash was one of the most active political and social leaders in the Punjab chapter of the Indian National Congress. During this time, he participated in and led many protests and demonstrations against the British occupation. Following the footsteps of many other political leaders of the time, he always wore traditional Indian clothing (kurta pajama) with a Nehru-style hat. His simplicity and activism made him a popular leader with the local populace and the regional British administration continuously sought to arrest him.\n\n The Indian National Congress (often called the Congress Party or simply Congress, abbr. INC) is a political party in India with widespread roots. Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. Congress led India to independence from the United Kingdom, and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire. The Congress today is one of the two major political parties in India, along with its main rival the Bharatiya Janata Party. It \n\n the motive of promoting the party during the elections.

The Indian National Congress, which had been formed to create a mature political dialogue with the British government, included both moderates and extremists. Many moderate leaders with liberal ideas left the Congress with the rise of Indian nationalism, and extremist leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When the Montagu report of 1918 was made public, there was a divide in the Congress over it. The moderates welcomed it while the extremists opposed it. This led to a schism in the Congress with moderate leaders forming the \"Indian National Liberal Federation\" in 1919.

It has its main stronghold in West Bengal. The party's current Secretary-General is Debabrata Biswas.

The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Avignon. The cathedral is a Romanesque building, constructed primarily in the second half of the 12th century. The bell tower collapsed in 1405 and was rebuilt in 1425. In 1670–1672 the apse was rebuilt and extended. This led to the destruction of the medieval cloister.

There were also a number of regiments from the British Army (referred to in India as \"Queen's troops\") stationed in India, but in 1857 several of these had been withdrawn to take part in the Crimean War or the Anglo-Persian War of 1856. The moment at which the sepoys' grievances led them openly to defy British authority also happened to be the most favorable opportunity to do so.\n\n Historians have identified diverse political, economic, military, religious and social causes of the Revolt of 1857 (First War of Indian Independence 1857). An uprising in several sepoy companies of the Bengal army was sparked by the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle in February 1857. Loading the Enfield often required tearing open the greased cartridge with one's teeth, and many sepoys believed that the cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat. This would have insulted both Hindu and Muslim religious practices; cows were considered holy by Hindus, while pigs were considered unclean (Haram) by Muslims. Underlying grievances over British taxation and recent land annexations by the \n\n  Bareilly (Rohilkhand) was a major centre during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as India's First War of Independence). The Rebellion which began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys) employed by the British East India Company's army, against perceived race based injustices and inequities, on 10 May 1857, in the town of Meerut, soon erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions which were mainly centred on north central India along the several major river valleys draining the south face of the Himalayas [See red annotated locations on Map at right] but with local episodes extending both northwest to Peshawar on the north-west frontier with Afghanistan and southeast \n\n Indian Rebellion of 1857 started when a group of sepoys rebelled against the introduction of rifle cartridges that were allegedly greased with pig or beef fat. This offended both Muslim soldiers, who did not eat pork and Hindu soldiers, who did not eat beef. The uprising spread rapidly in the surrounding areas of Delhi against the British. With the outbreak of the mutiny in Bareilly, Subhedar Bahadur Khan had been acclaimed as general by the sepoys involved. When Bakht Khan heard of the rebellion in Meerut, he decided to march to Delhi to support the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar's army. By the time Bakht Khan arrived at Delhi on 1 July 1857, with a large number of Rohilla sepoys, the city \n\n The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mile northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.

Written by Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King for the 1986 studio album Reign in Blood, the song's religious concept is about overthrowing Heaven. The song is four minutes and fourteen seconds in duration. It ends with a minute of rain sound effects. Described as a \"classic\" by Allmusic, it is noted by fans as one of Slayer's most popular songs. As an almost permanent addition to their live sets, both Hanneman and King acknowledged it as their favorite song to play live. Many of Slayer's live performances of the song have been captured on the band's live albums and also multi-band compilation albums including MTV2 Headbangers Ball. There have been many appearances of the song in the media and elsewhere, including the South Park episode \"Die Hippie, Die\", and the video games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, where it is considered difficult to play.\n\n \"Let It Rain\" is a song and single written and released by the British rock musician Eric Clapton and Bonnie Bramlett; it appears on his 1970 debut studio album Eric Clapton. It is the third and final single that was released from the album. Like Clapton's \"Strange Brew\", the song was originally recorded with other lyrics. The original version, titled \"She Rides\", is available on the expanded edition of the album. According to Bobby Whitlock, the great bass playing on \"Let It Rain\" is by Stephen Stills. But in the album Eric Clapton At his Best is credited to Carl Radle.\n\n AllMusic writer Matthew Greenwald notes, the song is \"led by a striking electric guitar riff\" with \"the melody [being] woven elegantly around the simple, almost folk-like chord changes\". Speaking to the lyrics, the critic recalled \"the clever use of \"rain\" and \"reign\" regarding the power of love is the core here\" and thinks that \"Clapton and Bramlett utilize it quite well\". Regarding the instrumental music work on the title, Greenwald finishes his song analysis by stating the \"song has some striking instrumental sections, including a lovely, brief section by Stephen Stills\". The song is in the key of D major. The melody has a strong resemblance to that of Stills's own song \"Questions\", recorded by both Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Clapton himself acknowledged its influence on \"Let It Rain\".\n\n \"Summer Rain\" is a song written by Robbie Seidman and Maria Vidal, produced by Rick Nowels for Belinda Carlisle's third album Runaway Horses (1989). The power ballad is about a man who goes away to war and leaves his wife, saying that nothing will change—they will be together forever and always. Although the conflict is unidentified, images in the video of a transport aircraft on an airfield and troops parachuting from transport aircraft suggest the man is an airborne soldier. The song is set in the present as his widow sings it, remembering the last time she saw him. It was released around the world in 1990 and was issued as a CD single, 7-inch single and a 12-inch single. The song had reasonable success on the charts reaching the top thirty in the United States and the UK, but was a bigger hit in Australia, where it reached the top ten. It was later covered by artists including Slinkee Minx, whose cover version of the song also reached the top ten in Australia. Belinda Carlisle stated in May 2013 that this was her favorite of her own songs.\n\n \"Rain\" is a 1997 song by Guano Apes. It was first released on January 1998 as a promotional single, but later had a full release on May 1998 as their second single from their debut album Proud Like a God. It is one of the songs by the band to have a softer sound, followed by \"Don't You Turn Your Back on Me\", \"Living in a Lie\", \"Pretty in Scarlet\" and \"Quietly\".

The Bank of Madras merged into the other two presidency banks in British India, the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay, to form the Imperial Bank of India, which in turn became the State Bank of India in 1955. Overall the bank has been formed from the merger and acquisition of nearly twenty banks over the course of its 200 year history. . The Government of India took control of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India's central bank) taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.\n\n October 1889 at 8, Council House Street in Central Kolkata's Dalhousie Square (now BBD Bagh).

Next, it was the liquidator for Lloyd's Bank's branch at Darjeeling and opened a branch \n\n The Oriental Bank Corporation, or \"OBC\", was a British imperial bank founded in India in 1842 which grew to be prominent throughout the Far East. As an Exchange bank, the OBC was primarily concerned with the finance of trade and exchanges of different currencies. It was the first bank in Hong Kong and the first bank to issue banknotes in Hong Kong.\n\n The bank was established in 1842 in Bombay, India, as the Bank of Western India. The bank moved its headquarters from Bombay to London in 1845, and opened branches in Colombo (1843), Calcutta (1844), Shanghai (1845), Canton (1845), Singapore (1846), and Hong Kong (1846). The Bank acquired the failing Bank of Ceylon in 1850, and obtained a royal charter for the merged institution under the name Oriental Bank Corporation in 1851. It was chartered in 1851 to allow competition with the East India Company's opium billing monopoly, which was unpopular in England at the time. Expansion followed with additional branches opening in Mauritius, Madras (Chennai), Thalassery, Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland, Wellington, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Foochow (Fuzhou), Yokohama, Hiogo (Kobe), and San Francisco. By the 1860s, the bank held a dominant \n\n in India and China and was considered the “most powerful, oldest, and most prestigious Eastern exchange bank,” and “the doyen of Eastern exchange banking.” From the 1870s, the bank's finances suffered greatly from bad loans to coffee plantations in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and to sugar plantations in Mauritius. On May 2, 1884 the bank suspended payment and it was subsequently liquidated in a Chancery proceeding. The majority of its branches and staff were sold to a new corporation and its business reconstituted as the New Oriental Bank Corporation. With growing competition from rivals, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the bank failed to survive and once again failed in 1892, an early victim of the impending trouble of 1893.\n\nQuestion: When was the entity that was dissolved after the Indian Rebellion in 1857 chartered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Opinion amongst the members of the British Parliament urged the government to control the activities of the Company. The Company's financial position was also bad and it had to apply for a loan from Parliament. Seizing this opportunity, the Parliament passed the Regulating Act (also known as East India Company Act) in 1773. The act set down regulations to control the Company Board and created the position of the Governor General. Warren Hastings was appointed \n\n It was during the British rule, that the Zamindars of Bengal and Bihar became equivalents of the landed aristocracy. Specifically in the laws of 1793, the zamindars were created absolute owners of the estates, and not just representatives of the sovereign rulers It was also during the conquest of Bengal, that the British settlers gained power in India. In 1612, Sir Thomas Roe was instructed by King James I to visit the Mughal Emperor to arrange for a commercial treaty which would give the Company exclusive rights to reside and build factories in Surat and other areas. The British were given the ability to trade in the Indian Empire by Emperor Jahangir.

The Madras Presidency was established so that the territory under direct Company control could be administered effectively. The direct administration began to cause resentment among the people. In 1806 the soldiers of the Vellore cantonment rebelled when William Bentinck, the Governor of Madras decreed that the native soldiers should abandon all caste marks. Fearing this act to be an attempt of forceful conversion to Christianity, the soldiers mutinied. The rebellion was suppressed but 114 British officers were killed and several hundred mutineers executed. Bentinck was recalled in disgrace.\n\n  By the late-18th century, the British East India Company emerged as the foremost military power in the region, defeating the French-allied Siraj-ud-Daulah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, that was largely brought about by the betrayal of the Nawab's once trusted general Mir Jafar. The company gained administrative control over the Nawab's dominions, including Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. It gained the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Mughal Court after the Battle of Buxar in 1765. Bengal, Bihar and Orissa were made part of the Bengal Presidency and annexed into the British colonial empire in 1793. The Indian mutiny of 1857 formally ended the authority of the Mughal court, when the British Raj replaced Company rule in India.

With an average depth of 5.1 m, the Parramatta River is the main tributary of Sydney Harbour, a branch of Port Jackson. Secondary tributaries include the smaller Lane Cove and Duck rivers. Formed by the confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek at North Parramatta, the river flows in an easterly direction to a line between Yurulbin in Birchgrove and Manns Point in Greenwich. Here it flows into Port Jackson, about 21 km from the Tasman Sea. The total catchment area of the river is approximately 252.4 km2 and is tidal to Charles Street Weir in Parramatta, approximately 30 km from the Sydney Heads. The land adjacent to the Parramatta River was occupied for many thousands of years by Aboriginal peoples of the Wallumettagal nations and the Wangal, Toongagal (or Tugagal), Burramattagal, and Wategora clans of the Darug people. They used the river as an important source of food and a place for trade. The river was formed 15 to 29 million years ago as its waters began to cut a valley into sandstone and shale.\n\n channeled in a concrete drain; and domestic garbage is often scattered along the creek's banks. Prior to April 2015, the creek was dammed at many places by fallen trees, and the rapids at Mons Road were not visible. The stagnant water in the dams was bubbly. After the rain in April 2015, which caused a flood that damaged infrastructure at Parramatta, most of the dead trees were cleaned away and the rocks at Mons Road are now exposed.

They used the river as an important source of food and a place for trade.\n\n From its start at the confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek at North Parramatta, the river flows in a southerly direction through the grounds of Cumberland Hospital. Entering Parramatta Park, it then turns east and flows through the Parramatta CBD. Both banks are largely open to the public, with parkland and walkways, downstream to James Ruse Drive. The river is fed by a number of small creeks and stormwater drains. The waters are controlled by a series of weirs: the weir at the edge of the hospital grounds, the Kiosk Weir in Parramatta Park, the Marsden Street Weir, and the Charles Street Weir at the ferry wharf. The weirs have been equipped with fish ladders. Kiosk Weir and Charles Street Weir also include footbridges enabling a crossing of the river. Historically, the river was dammed to provide reservoirs for the town. Currently, however, the function of the weirs is aesthetic, preventing the water from draining away during dry periods. As a consequence the river floods in heavy rain, particularly at the Charles Street Weir. The Charles Street Weir forms the boundary between fresh water and salt water, and is also the limit of tides.\n\n Toongabbie Creek, an urban watercourse that is part of the Parramatta River catchment, is located in Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\n Toongabbie Creek rises in the north-western suburbs of Sydney, west of the Old Northern Road, within the suburb of ; with its headwaters forming the watershed boundary between the Hornsby Plateau and the Cumberland Plain.

It exists within Marvel's main shared universe. It was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Marie Severin in Sub-Mariner #9 (January 1969). The Serpent Crown is, as its name implies, a crown which resembles a coiled, seven-headed serpent and is made of an unknown material. The resemblance is a reference to the malevolent seven-headed exiled serpent demon/god \"Set\" to whom the crown holds a mystical link from which it draws its powers. Those powers confer on the helmet's wearer various abilities. These abilities can include superhuman strength, the power to read and control the minds of others, the power to levitate oneself and/or other persons and objects, the ability to cast illusions, the power to project destructive bolts of mystical energy and even the mental ability to manipulate matter and energy. However use of the crown usually leads the wearer to fall under the mental domination of Set, who then has the wearer perform various tasks which would help facilitate its physical return to the Earth dimension.\n\n In the comic book tie-in series to the video game, Alfred remained loyal to Bruce even when Bruce began the Insurgency and opposed Superman and had his secret identity exposed.

She was the third and youngest child of Edward William and his wife, Mary Spring O'Brien. Her elder siblings were Dermod and Nelly. Her paternal grandfather was William Smith O'Brien, and a maternal cousin was Mary Spring Rice. O'Brien was educated at home. Following the death of her mother from tuberculosis, the three siblings were raised by their aunt, Charlotte Grace O'Brien. In 1894, she married a childhood friend of her brother, barrister and administrator Arthur Beresford Cane, CBE (died 1939). The couple had two daughters. O'Brien joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross, serving at the headquarters from 1914 to 1917 under Katharine Furse. She eventually moved to England and became the VAD assistant director, and retired in 1919 with a CBE. She died in London on 23 April 1926. Some of her correspondence is held along with that of her family in the National Library of Ireland.

Smith's childhood was shaped by her mother's early death (probably in giving birth to Catherine) and her father's reckless spending. After losing his wife, Nicholas Turner travelled and the children were raised by Lucy Towers, their maternal aunt; when exactly their father returned is unknown. At the age of six, Charlotte went to school in Chichester and took drawing lessons from the painter George Smith.

Audio description involves a narrator providing a spoken commentary that describes the visual elements of the dance performance in detail. This narration includes descriptions of the dancers' movements, spatial arrangements, costumes, and any other visual components that are essential to understanding the performance.\n\nAnother technique is choreographed body sounds or movement sonification. This involves creating specific sounds or using musical elements that are synchronized with the dancers' movements. By incorporating auditory cues, individuals with visual impairments can perceive and interpret the dance performance through sound, enhancing their overall experience.\n\nHaptic techniques, such as touch tours, can also be utilized. A touch tour allows individuals with visual impairments to explore the dance performance space before the actual performance. During the touch tour, participants can feel and touch the set designs, props, and even interact with the dancers to gain a tactile understanding of the performance. This hands-on experience adds a multi-sensory dimension to the dance performance.\n\nBy combining these techniques, dance performances can become more accessible to individuals with visual impairment or blindness. These approaches aim to strengthen the cultural participation of non-sighted individuals in the aesthetic experience of dance, expand the possibilities of artistic research in dance, and inspire new lines of research that go beyond visual perception.\n\nIt is worth noting that while these techniques enhance the accessibility of dance performances for individuals with visual impairments, ongoing collaboration and feedback from the visually impaired community are essential to ensure the effectiveness and inclusivity of these approaches.\n\n Arcane Collective is a contemporary dance production company, producing and presenting work from a cooperative of international artists from different backgrounds. It was founded in 2011 by Morleigh Steinberg, a dancer and choreographer and Oguri, a dancer and choreographer from Japan. Their performance Cold Dream Colour was presented in 2012, as a homage to the important Irish artist Louis le Brocquy, the performance being inspired by his paintings. Morleigh explained \"He so often pays homage to different painters, and I thought, for his birthday we could pay homage to him.\" The music was composed by Paul Chavez and performed by U2's The Edge with choreography by Liz Roche Steinberg, the artistic director of the piece staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister Roxanne, wife of Oguri. Excerpts from Cold Dream Colour were performed at the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series in New York in 2013 and Irish broadcaster John Kelly moderated a discussion of the work with its creators. Collaborating dancers include Cat Westwood, Boaz Barkan, Sherwood Chen, Joyce Lu and Dani Lunn and costume design by Mariad Whisker.\n\n \"The Salmon Dance\" is a song by the English electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers and is the seventh track on their 2007 studio album We Are the Night. It features vocals by Fatlip and was released as the second single from the album on 10 September 2007.

Daphne explains that her daughter, who lives with Daphne's ex-husband, does not understand that Daphne spends time away to support the family. Marshall insists on bringing Daphne to the speech recital, which they reach in time, correctly believing that Daphne's daughter will forgive her as long as she shows up. Daphne is proud when her daughter gives an aggressive speech that praises oil and denounces environmentalism; Marshall, feeling uneasy, says farewell to Daphne and excuses himself and Marvin to continue their journey to Farhampton.

Ted reluctantly attempts to take her, even after she displays little compatibility with him. Making matters worse, she trips and sprains her ankle and Ted is forced to carry her to the top of the lighthouse, after which he throws up.

The song is a mid-tempo ballad which lyrically deals with heartbreak. \"Never Too Far\" was used on the charity single \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\", which combines the first verse of the song with a re-recorded version of the first verse and bridge of Carey's previous single \"Hero\" (1993). The single did not make much impact on the US charts; however, it did reach the top forty in the UK \n\nPlease keep them away ; Don't let them touch me ; Please don't let them lie ; Don't let them see me \"Complex\" is a song by British musician Gary Numan.

The recording's backing track uses conventional acoustic drums, acoustic piano, and electric bass guitar, however the distinctive lead parts are performed on violin, viola, and heavily flanged and reverberated analogue monosynth, an unusual combination in popular music. Lyrically, the song alludes to a psychological complex, expressing a paranoia that might have been directed at critics, fans, stalkers or false friends, depending on one's point of view:  A BBC Radio 1 review panel speculated that this song was \"the first electronic ballad\", although this is untrue, as it post-dates recordings such as \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" by Ultravox and \"Neon Lights\" by Kraftwerk by a couple of years.\n\n Songs from Dawson's Creek is the first soundtrack album for the teen drama television series Dawson's Creek.

The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. Dig Me Out marked the debut of Janet Weiss, who would become the band's longest-serving drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy. Two singles were released in support of the album: \"One More Hour\" and \"Little Babies\". The title track \"Dig Me Out\" peaked at number six on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single. The album was acclaimed by music critics, who praised the album's energy and feminist lyrics.

The band has since released two studio albums, Lifelines (2016) and Trauma (2019). The band found success with their original material as well, with the singles \"Breaking Down\" and \"Hurricane\" performing well on rock radio, the single \"Bow Down\" being nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2019, and Trauma being nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album the same year.\n\n Dig Me Out is the follow-up to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's reputation as one of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock \n\n I Love You is a recording act fronted by Justin Randel that is based in Brooklyn, New York. Formed in 2004 as a trio, the project used various names until late in that year when Yah Tibyah La Blu (a slightly bastardized translation of \"I Love You\" in Russian) became \"official.\" For practical reasons, the group began using the English phrase by the release of their first recordings. In 2006, bassist Kevin Kesterson departed, making a duo of the group. Then in 2008, drummer Jeffrey Schlette parted ways with I Love You, making Randel the sole member. In 2009, video artist Charlie Mylie joined up with Randel, throwing psychedelic visuals into the mix during live performances. During October of that year the duo released their first recording for Indianapolis, Indiana's Joyful Noise Recordings, Bell Ord Forrest. In 2008, I Love You became a solo act again. According to his MySpace page, frontman Justin Randel released Feeling Bad To Feel Better in October 2011 on CD and cassette.

For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called Divisionism, attracted many followers such as Paul Signac, and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted Expressionism and Fauvism, and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of \n\n natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement. Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment—now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation. Caillebotte's interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality, however \n\n Divisionism, along with the Neo-Impressionism movement as a whole, found its beginnings in Georges Seurat's masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Seurat had received classical training at the École des Beaux-Arts, and, as such, his initial works reflected the Barbizon style. In 1883, Seurat and some of his colleagues began exploring ways to express as much light as possible on the canvas By 1884, with the exhibition of his first major work, Bathing at Asnières, as well as croquetons of the island of La Grande Jatte, his style began taking form with an awareness of Impressionism, but it was not until he finished La Grande Jatte in 1886 that he established his theory of chromoluminarism. In fact, La Grande Jatte was not initially painted in the Divisionist style, but he reworked the painting in the winter of 1885-86, enhancing its optical properties in accordance with his interpretation of scientific theories of color and light\n\n Alphonse Osbert (23 March 1857 – 11 August 1939) was a French Symbolist painter. Educated at the École des Beaux-Arts, his earliest passion was for the great Spanish masters, particularly Jusepe de Ribera. A shift away from his academic style took place in the late 1880s under the influence of several acquaintances associated with Post-Impressionism and Symbolism. Osbert abandoned naturalistic painting in favour of a Pointillist technique like that employed by Seurat and Signac. Also inspired by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the Symbolists, he chose to forsake depiction of real-world subject matter, and developed a poetic visual language of his own. His signature style consists of ghostlike Muses in mysterious landscapes bathed in the unearthly light of a sun or moon, rendered with abundant use of the colour blue. In the 1890s he was associated with Joséphin Péladan and his order of Rosicrucianism. Osbert's later works include a few commissioned murals, for sites including the Centre Thermal des Dômes in Vichy (1903 and 1904), and the Church Of Saint-Louis in Vichy (1915). An overview of his career titled 'Le peintre symboliste Alphonse Osbert', written by Véronique Dumas, was published by CNRS in 2005.\n\n The painting depicts an imaginary location with contemporary visitors. It has decidedly modern elements, such as 18th-century French cloaks and hoods, a woman pointing at a statue like a tourist, and a pair of modern pink shoes belonging to a bather. The contemporary allusions make the nudity atypical; 18th-century paintings normally restricted nudity to mythological and allegorical subjects. In his 2006 book Logics of Worlds, the post-Marxist philosopher Alain Badiou analysed the painting as an example of how \"pictoral assemblage\" fundamentally is about \"distributing identities and differences\". He saw the composition of temple, women, statues and water as \"a subtle transcendental network of identities\", exalted by \"figurative differences\", which place the painting in the genre of neoclassicism. Badiou concluded that \"the world\" of the painting is the juncture between eighteenth-century eroticism and pre-romanticism. Finally, he used the correspondences between the statues and groups of women, and the foliage to the left and the clearing to the bottom left, to argue that existence merely is a category of appearing.\n\nQuestion: Where did the painter of The Mud Bath study?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Laiki Geitonia's restoration of houses is an example of traditional Cypriot urban architecture. The buildings date from the end of the 18th Century, with building materials being mainly wood, sandstone and mudbrick. It is a pedestrianised area of narrow winding streets, combining residential houses with craft shops, souvenir shops and tavernas. The main Tourist Information Centre in Nicosia is located in Laiki Geitonia and a number of walking tours of Nicosia start on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays from that place.\n\n Dervish Pasha Mansion (Derviş Paşa Konağı) is a historical mansion and ethnographic museum in the Arab Ahmet quarter of Nicosia, currently located in North Nicosia. It lies on the Beliğ Paşa Street and has two floors. It is considered to be one of the finest examples of Ottoman architecture in Cyprus. The current mansion was built on an earlier Gothic building on the same site. Its front door bears the date of 1801 inscribed on it, implying that this was the date of construction of the building. It was repaired in 1869, with the ornate wood carvings on the ceiling being dated to this year. It belonged at the end of the 19th century to Hacı Ahmet Derviş Efendi, a wealthy Turkish Cypriot who owned large swathes of land outside the walled city of Nicosia. The lower floor is made of stone and the \n\n floor is made of adobe. Its architecture carries a heavy Ottoman character and reflects the Ottoman lifestyle of the time. It has two entrance doors, historically, one was for men (selamlik) and one was for women (harem). It has a large inner courtyard, which was used by the household members for relaxation without exposure to the outside. A bay window at the upper floor was built in the Baghdadi style. In 1979, the mansion was in the danger of collapse. It was purchased by the Turkish Cypriot state in 1981 and following a renovation, opened to visitors as an ethnographic museum on 21 March 1988. It is notable as the first significant renovation project in Northern Cyprus. In the mansion, assets of traditional Cypriot lifestyle, such as kitchen utensils, instruments for needlework, as well as old swords and historical clothes are on display.\n\n both the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia and the Limassol District Archaeological Museum. In the agora there are marble columns decorated with spirals and a huge paved squares. On the coastal side of the city there is an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi-precious stones.

Sir Frank Stenton apparently coined the phrase, arguing that Offa of Mercia, who ruled 757–796, effectively achieved the unification of England south of the Humber estuary. Scholastic opinion on the relationship between the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia at this time remains divided. While the precise period during which the Mercian Supremacy existed remains uncertain – depending upon whether one includes the reigns of Penda (c. 626–655) and Wulfhere (658–675) – the end of the era is generally agreed to be around 825, following the defeat of King Beornwulf at the Battle of Ellandun (near present-day Swindon). Nicholas Brooks noted that \n\n The English population was not politically unified until the 10th century. Before then, there were a number of petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a heptarchy of seven states, the most powerful of which were Mercia and Wessex. The English nation state began to form when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms united against Danish Viking invasions, which began around 800 AD. Over the following century and a half England was for the most part a politically unified entity, and remained permanently so after 959. The nation of England was formed in 937 by Æthelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh, as Wessex grew from a relatively small kingdom in the South West to become the founder of the Kingdom of the English, incorporating all Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the Danelaw.\n\n bretwalda, or 'Britain ruler'. Under St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last of the seven traditional kingdoms of the heptarchy to undergo Christianisation. By the 8th century the kingdom had expanded to include the territory of the Haestingas. Around 827 in the aftermath of the battle of Ellandun, Sussex was annexed by the kingdom of Wessex, a kingdom that with further expansion became the kingdom of England. In 1066 Norman forces arrived in Sussex, the heartland of King Harold Godwinson. Defeating Harold at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror established five (later six) semi-independent territories known as rapes. The South Saxon see was transferred from Selsey \n\n The kingdom of England emerged from the gradual unification of the early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdoms known as the Heptarchy: East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria, Kent, Essex, Sussex, and Wessex. The Viking invasions of the 9th century upset the balance of power between the English kingdoms, and native Anglo-Saxon life in general. The English lands were unified in the 10th century in a reconquest completed by King Æthelstan in A.D. 927. During the Heptarchy, the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms might become acknowledged as Bretwalda, a high king over the other kings. The decline of Mercia allowed Wessex to become \n\n By 600, a new order was developing, of kingdoms and sub-Kingdoms.

In the village of Givry in Burgundy, half the population is confirmed to have died in August-November 1348. The Black Death in Paris is described in the famous chronicle of the Carmelite Jean de Venette in the Saint-Denis Abbey in Ille de France outside of Paris. At the time, Paris was the biggest city in Europe, with a population of between 80.000 and 200.000 people. According to Jean de Venette, the plague first arrived to Roissy near Gonesse in June 1348. He claims, that 16.000 people died in Saint-Denis and 800 people daily in Paris between November and December, were 500 died was transported to mass burial each day from \n\n outbreak of the Black Death pandemic. Estimated to have caused the abrupt death of 30 to 60% of Europe's population, it led to widespread social and economic disruption and deep religious disaffection and fanaticism. Minority groups, and Jews in particular were blamed, singled out and attacked. As a consequence, many Jews fled and resettled in Eastern Europe. The death of large parts of the population caused a major collapse of the labour force. Human power became a rare commodity and the social and economic situation of average workers improved for several decades as employers were forced to pay higher wages.\n\n The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices for the remainder of the medieval period.\n\n The population decline caused by the Black Death resulted in smaller taxes and smaller income for the elite, and a smaller work force who demanded better salary and better conditions from the elite, who reacted to the demands by repression and violence toward their work force. In parallel, the dissolution of law and order in the countryside during the plague became long-lasting when unemployed mercenaries, known as the Condottiero, took control of the countryside population. The Black Death in Italy came to have great importance for the development of modern quarantine law, health authorities and hospitals in Europe. When the \n\nThe Black Death had significant effects on both European and Chinese populations. In Europe, the disease caused widespread devastation, eventually killing about a third of the continent's population, which amounted to approximately 25 million people. The disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the European populace, as it originated in Asia and had never been encountered before in Europe.\n\nThe Black Death primarily spread through infected fleas that lived on rats and other rodents, specifically causing bubonic plague. Cities like Venice and Paris experienced a high death toll, with Venice losing 60% of its population over 18 months, and Paris losing 800 people per day at the peak of the epidemic. By 1349, half of Paris' population had died. These staggering numbers highlight the devastating impact of the disease.\n\nIn China, the Black Death also had significant consequences, with an estimated death toll of 13 million people. Similar to Europe, the disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the population. However, it is important to note that the Black Death did not solely affect Europe but caused high mortality rates in various regions around the world.\n\nThe devastating effects of the Black Death prompted the rise of hospitals in medieval society. Hospitals played a crucial role in caring for the sick, effectively isolating them to protect the well. They also aided in controlling the spread of the disease. Notably, hospitals served all classes of society, as the Black Death did not discriminate based on social status.\n\nOverall, the Black Death had profound effects on both European and Chinese populations, causing widespread mortality and social changes. It serves as a significant event in history, highlighting the devastating impact of infectious diseases and the importance of implementing measures to control and treat them.\n\nQuestion: How much did the Black Death reduce the population of the region offered aid by the marshall plan?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After Æthelstan had defeated the Vikings at York in 928, Constantine II, the Scottish King, recognised the threat posed by the House of Wessex to his own position, and began forging alliances with neighbouring kingdoms to attempt a pre-emptive strike against Æthelstan. He married his daughter to Amlaíb mac Gofraid (also called Olaf Guthfrithsson, and Anlaf in the poem), the Norse-Gael King of Dublin. Amlaíb had a claim to the throne of Northumbria, from which Æthelstan expelled his father in 927. Thus, the invading army combined \"Vikings, Scots, and Strathclyde Britons.\" On the English side, Æthelstan was joined by his brother, the later King Edmund. In the ensuing battle, the combined forces of Wessex and Mercia won a decisive victory.\n\n In the ninth century the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia, came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington. In the 880s and 890s the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, but the rest of England was under Viking kings. Alfred constructed a network of fortresses, and these helped him to \n\n rebellion, and Æthelwulf led a West Saxon contingent in a successful joint campaign. In the same year Burgred married Æthelwulf's daughter, Æthelswith. In 825, Ecgberht sent Æthelwulf to invade the Mercian sub-kingdom of Kent, and its sub-king, Baldred, was driven out shortly afterwards. By 830, Essex, Surrey and Sussex had submitted to Ecgberht, and he had appointed Æthelwulf to rule the south-eastern territories as king of Kent. The Vikings ravaged the Isle of Sheppey in 835, and the following year they defeated Ecgberht at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing \n\n Eadfrith of Leominster also known as Eadridus was a seventh century Catholic saint from Anglo-Saxon England. Although very little is known of his early life, he is an important figure in the process of Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England. Eadfrith came from Northumbria and worked as a missionary to the Hwicce kingdom and in 660 converted King Merewalh of the Hwicce, a contemporary (and possibly son) of King Penda of Mercia. Around 660 Eadfrith also founded Leominster Abbey for women, as a conventual priory of the monks of Reading Abbey. This abbey was mentioned in the Domesday Book and was re-founded about 1139. at which time it may have been associated with the royal family. Eadfrith is known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript, but also the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Catalogus sanctorum pausantium in Anglia. Eadfrith died in 675 and was buried in Leominster. His feast day is on 26 October.\n\n no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling. When Ecgberht died in 839, he was succeeded by his son Æthelwulf; all subsequent West Saxon kings were descendants of Ecgberht and Æthelwulf, and were also sons of kings. At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the Anglo-Saxons. Mercia dominated southern England, but its supremacy came to an end in 825 when it was decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to Viking attacks. In 853, King Burgred of Mercia requested West Saxon help to suppress a \n\nQuestion: When was the country Merewalh was a citizen of abolished?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1894, the Hackney District Board of Works was dissolved, with the vestries of Hackney and Stoke Newington assuming the powers of the district board. Stoke Newington Vestry built a town hall at 126 Church Street. At the same time, the Vestry of the Parish of Plumstead became a separate authority, with the remaining four parishes of Plumstead District being reconstituted as Lee District Board of Works. In 1896, the parishes of Southwark St Olave and St Thomas were combined as a civil parish. In 1900, metropolitan boroughs created by the London Government Act replaced the vestries and district boards.\n\n In 1907 there were exchanges of land with the neighbouring Worsley Urban District, and in 1933 most of Clifton and a part of Prestwich Urban District were added to Swinton and Pendlebury. Swinton and Pendlebury received its Charter of Incorporation as a municipal borough from Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby at a ceremony in Victoria Park on 29 September 1934. In 1955 a very small part of Worsley Urban District was added to Swinton and Pendlebury. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Swinton of Pendlebury was abolished, and Swinton has since 1 April 1974 formed an unparished area of the City of Salford, a metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.\n\n In 1932 it was enlarged by the abolition of the Nuneaton Rural District the Foleshill Rural District and the Solihull Rural District. It also lost territory as the county boroughs of Solihull and Coventry expanded their boundaries. The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Part of it to the south was merged with the Solihull county borough to become part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in the new West Midlands county. Part of it to the north was merged with the Atherstone Rural District to become part of North Warwickshire. At the time of its abolition in 1974 Meriden RD consisted of the following civil parishes: \n\n Government Act 1972 led to the abolition of these local authorities and the creation of the West Midlands metropolitan county and its seven metropolitan boroughs (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall, and Wolverhampton), which came into being on 1 April 1974. From that date, the original WMPTA was disbanded. In its place, the new West Midlands County Council (WMCC) became the PTA for the West Midlands. However, this new arrangement ultimately proved to be short lived, as the Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan county councils, the WMCC among them, with effect from 1 April 1986. On that date, a new WMPTA was formed, comprising members from the West Midlands' seven metropolitan borough councils. \n\n The first place of worship to occupy the site is thought to be a small chapel provided by Lady Godiva. Both she and her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia paid for many religious buildings in the region. After the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon chapel was replaced by one of sandstone in c.1150. The tower and north aisle were added in the 15th and 16th centuries respectively. The Norman ashlared sandstone chancel was replaced in 1782 with one of brick containing a Palladian window. This window was replaced with a stained glass rose in the 19th century, the south aisle and vestry also date from this period. In the 20th century a choir vestry and south transept were added, and extensive repairs were carried out after incendiary bomb damage in the Second World War.\n\nQuestion: When was Lady Godiva's birthplace abolished?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was fought between a Royal army, commanded by the earls of Pembroke and Devon, and a rebel force led by supporters of the Earl of Warwick. The battle took place 6 mi northeast of Banbury in Northamptonshire; it resulted in a rebel victory which temporarily handed power over to the Earl of Warwick.

Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid says that Wulfhere \"stirred up all the southern nations against [Northumbria]\". Bede does not report the fighting, nor is it mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but according to Stephen, Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere, forcing him to surrender Lindsey, and to pay tribute. Wulfhere survived the defeat but evidently lost some degree of control over the south as a result; in 675, Æscwine, one of the kings of the West Saxons, fought him at Biedanheafde. It is not known where this battle was, or who was the victor. Henry of Huntingdon, a 12th-century historian who had access to versions \n\n An important pitched battle that demonstrated the evolution of tactics and technology during the Middle Ages was the battle of Hastings fought on the 14 October 1066. This battle was fought between the Norman-French Army under William the Conqueror and the English army under Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. This pitched battle was fought as William engaged Godwinson who deployed his army of infantry in a small dense formation at the top of a steep slope. The English formation held heavy infantry, referred to as housecarls, at the centre and light infantry on the flanks. Across the front of Godwinson's battle line was a shield wall made from soldiers interlocking their shields holding spears and missile troops behind. The Normans under William deployed in three groups which consisted of their origins, Bretons \n\n At the beginning of 1645, the Royalists still controlled most of the West Country, Wales, and counties along the English border. On 14 June, the New Model Army under Sir Thomas Fairfax won a decisive victory over Prince Rupert at Naseby. This left Lord Goring's Western Army as the last significant Royalist field force. The New Model linked up with the Western Association Army under Edward Massey, and forced Goring to end the blockade of Taunton. The next day, Fairfax destroyed the Royalist Western Army at Langport. Before moving against the Royalist-held port of Bristol, he first had to secure his rear. Large parts of the West Country were controlled by Clubmen, local militia groups set up to resist depredations from either side, which were often a greater threat than \n\n The Battle of the Trent was a battle fought at an unspecified site near the River Trent within the Kingdom of Lindsey (today part of England), in 679. The battle was fought between the Northumbrian army of King Ecgfrith and the Mercian army of King Æthelred. The Mercians were victorious, ending Northumbrian domination of the area. Lindsey remained part of Mercia until the Viking invasion of the 9th century. Bede notes in Ecclesiastical History of the English People that the 18-year-old subking, Ælfwine of Deira, was killed in the battle, and that this almost led to further conflict between the two kingdoms, needing the intervention of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In his account of the battle, Bede recounts the tale of a Northumbrian thegn called Imm or Imma, who may have been the founder of the settlement of Immingham. Imma was captured by the Mercians and, proving troublesome, was sold into slavery to a Frisian merchant who, when his identity was discovered, then ransomed him to one of the kings of Kent.\n\nQuestion: When was a participant in the Battle of Maserfield abolished?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others. The Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe. The Black Death in France was described by eyewitnesses such as Louis Heyligen, Jean de Venette and Gilles Li Muisis. The Black Death migrated from Southern France to Spain, from Eastern France to the Holy Roman Empire, and to England by ship from Gascony. At the time, Pope Clement VI resided in Avignon in present-day France during the Western Schism, and issued his condemnations of the Jewish persecutions during the Black Death as well as the flagellants. During the Black Death in France, King Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to compose the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic.\n\n  The Black Death was present in the Holy Roman Empire between 1348 and 1351. The Holy Roman Empire, composed of today's Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, was, geographically, the largest country in Europe at the time, and the pandemic lasted several years due to the size of the Empire. Several witness accounts do exist from the Black Death in the Holy Roman Empire, although they were often either written after the events took place, or are very short.\n\nBubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop. This includes fever, headaches, and vomiting.Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin. Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open. The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal. In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Diagnosis is by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes. Prevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.Death if it occurs is typically within ten days. With treatment the risk of death is around 10%. Globally in 2013 there were about 750 documented cases which resulted in 126 deaths. The disease is most common in Africa. Plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people. This was about 25% to 60% of the European population. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor. Some historians see this as a turning point in European economic development.The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word βουβών, meaning groin.The term buboes is also used to refer to the swollen lymph nodes.\nSigns and symptoms The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea, the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e., of the fingers, toes, lips and nose) is another common symptom. Because of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium. Symptoms include: Chills General ill feeling (malaise) High fever (39 °C; 102 °F) Muscle cramps Seizures Smooth, painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo, commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often near the site of the initial infection (bite or scratch) Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears Gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose. Other symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood (hematemesis), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium, and coma. Cause Bubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remained harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply. Y. pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague. Diagnosis Laboratory testing is required in order to diagnose and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of Y. pestis culture from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining serum taken during the early and late stages of infection. To quickly screen for the Y. pestis antigen in patients, rapid dipstick tests have been developed for field use. Treatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases. People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics. Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection. History The first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence). The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian’s efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague. Procopius, in his work Secret History, declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness. Second outbreak Main articles: Black Death and Second plague pandemic In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population. It is believed that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia, and this was proven correct as Chinese records showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea. In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another. There were many ethno-medical beliefs for avoiding the Black Death. One of the most famous was that by walking around with flowers in or around their nose people would be able to ward off the stench and perhaps the evil that afflicted them. People believed the plague to be a punishment from God, and that the only way to be rid of the plague was to be forgiven by God.One such method used was to carve the symbol of the cross onto the front door of a house with the words Lord have mercy on us. Pistoia, a city in Italy, went as far as enacting rules and regulations on the city and its inhabitants to keep it safe from the Black Death. The rules stated that no one was allowed to visit any plague-infected area and if they did they were not allowed back into the city. Some other rules were that no linen or woollen goods were to be imported into the city and no corpses were to be buried in the city. Despite strict enforcement of the rules, the city eventually became infected. People who were not infected with the plague gathered in groups and stayed away from the sick. They ate and drank with limited food and water and were not even allowed oral communication because it was believed that merely talking with one another increased the chance of passing on the disease. While Europe was devastated by the disease, the rest of the world fared much better. In India, population rose from a population of 91 million in 1300, to 97 million in 1400, to 105 million in 1500. Sub-Saharan Africa remained largely unaffected by the plagues. The next few centuries were marked by several localized or regional outbreaks of lesser severity. The Great Plague of Milan (1629-1631), the Great Plague of Seville (1647), the Great Plague of London (1665–1666), the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), Great Baltic plague (1708–1712), the Great Plague of Marseille (1720), the Great Plague of 1738 and Caragea's Plague (1813–1814) were the last major outbreaks of the bubonic plague in Europe.\n\n The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Switzerland and Austria from Northern Italy in the South and Savoy in the West, and the Rhine and Central Germany from Northern France, and Northern Germany from Denmark. It continued from the Empire East to the Baltics and finally to Russia.\n\n  From Lyon, the plague spread across Burgundy. In the village of Givry in Burgundy, half the population is confirmed to have died in August-November 1348. The Black Death in Paris is described in the famous chronicle of the Carmelite Jean de Venette in the Saint-Denis Abbey in Ille de France outside of Paris. At the time, Paris was the biggest city in Europe, with a population of between 80.000 and 200.000 people. According to Jean de Venette, the plague first arrived to Roissy near Gonesse in June 1348. He claims, that 16.000 people died in Saint-Denis and 800 people daily in Paris between November and December, were 500 died was transported to mass burial each day from \n\nQuestion: By approximately what percentage did the Black Death reduce the population of the region that the Soviet Union feared invasion from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The last epidemic of bubonic plague in France was the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720.\n\n  The Black Death was present in France between 1347 and 1352. The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others.

He claims, that 16.000 people died in Saint-Denis and 800 people daily in Paris between November and December, were 500 died was transported to mass burial each day from \n\nThe Black Death had significant effects on both European and Chinese populations. In Europe, the disease caused widespread devastation, eventually killing about a third of the continent's population, which amounted to approximately 25 million people. The disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the European populace, as it originated in Asia and had never been encountered before in Europe.\n\nThe Black Death primarily spread through infected fleas that lived on rats and other rodents, specifically causing bubonic plague. Cities like Venice and Paris experienced a high death toll, with Venice losing 60% of its population over 18 months, and Paris losing 800 people per day at the peak of the epidemic. By 1349, half of Paris' population had died. These staggering numbers highlight the devastating impact of the disease.\n\nIn China, the Black Death also had significant consequences, with an estimated death toll of 13 million people. Similar to Europe, the disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the population. However, it is important to note that the Black Death did not solely affect Europe but caused high mortality rates in various regions around the world.\n\nThe devastating effects of the Black Death prompted the rise of hospitals in medieval society. Hospitals played a crucial role in caring for the sick, effectively isolating them to protect the well. They also aided in controlling the spread of the disease. Notably, hospitals served all classes of society, as the Black Death did not discriminate based on social status.\n\nOverall, the Black Death had profound effects on both European and Chinese populations, causing widespread mortality and social changes. It serves as a significant event in history, highlighting the devastating impact of infectious diseases and the importance of implementing measures to control and treat them.\n\nThe bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, had immense historical significance in Europe between 1346 and 1350. During this time, the plague caused a devastating epidemic that resulted in the deaths of approximately 20 million people, which was about a quarter of Europe's population. This epidemic remains the largest recorded tally of fatalities caused by a single epidemic in European history.\n\nThe bubonic plague had a significant impact on the demographic, social, and economic aspects of Europe. The massive loss of life caused by the plague led to a population decline, resulting in a shortage of labor and changes in social structures. With a significant reduction in population, there was a subsequent labor shortage which led to increased wages for those who survived. This shift in economic dynamics had long-lasting effects on European society.\n\nFurthermore, the epidemic also brought about profound psychological and cultural changes. The widespread devastation caused by the Black Death altered people's perceptions of life, death, and religion. It deeply affected religious beliefs and practices, as many turned to religious institutions in search of answers and solace during these dark times. The plague's impact on society can be seen in the art, literature, and religious practices of the time.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, the bubonic plague is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium transmitted through fleas that infest rats. The disease primarily affects rodents, but when infected fleas are forced to seek alternative hosts, such as humans, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause severe symptoms. The characteristic swollen lymph nodes, known as buboes, appear in the neck, groin, or armpit area. The plague had devastating effects, killing approximately two-thirds of those infected within days.\n\nOverall, the bubonic plague's historical significance in Europe between 1346 and 1350 lies in its immense death toll, demographic changes, social and economic impacts, as well as its profound influence on cultural and religious aspects of society.\n\nQuestion: As a result of the black death it is estimated that the population of the country for Bâton à feu was reduced by how much?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As the river changed course, the natural flow of freshwater and sediment changed as well, resulting in periods of land building and land loss in different areas of the delta. This process by which the river changes course is known as avulsion, or delta-switching, and forms the variety of landscapes that make up the Mississippi River Delta. The Atchafalaya River is the largest distributary of the Mississippi River and is also considered to be an influential part of the continual land-building processes within the Mississippi River Delta. The \n\n Until the early 20th century, the Colorado River ran free from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado southwest into Mexico, where it flowed into the Gulf of California. Significant quantities of nourishing silt from throughout the Colorado River Basin were carried downstream, creating the vast Colorado River Delta. Prior to the construction of major dams along its route, the Colorado River fed one of the largest desert estuaries in the world. Spread across the northernmost end of the Gulf of California, the Colorado River delta's vast riparian, freshwater, brackish, and tidal wetlands once covered 7810 km2 and supported a large population of plant, bird, aquatic, and terrestrial life. Because most of the river's flow reached the delta at that time, its freshwater, silt, and nutrients helped create and sustain a complex system of estuarial wetlands that provided feeding and nesting grounds for birds, and spawning habitat for fish and marine mammals. In contrast to the surrounding Sonoran Desert, the Colorado River delta's abundance was striking.\n\n  The Mississippi River Delta is the confluence of the Mississippi River with the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana, southeastern United States. The river delta is a 3 e6acre area of land that stretches from Vermilion Bay on the west, to the Chandeleur Islands in the east, on Louisiana's southeastern coast. It is part of the Gulf of Mexico and the Louisiana coastal plain, one of the largest areas of coastal wetlands in the United States. The Mississippi River Delta is the 7th largest river delta on Earth (USGS) and is an important coastal region for the United States, containing more than 2.7 e6acre of coastal wetlands and 37% of the estuarine marsh in the conterminous U.S. The coastal area is the nation's largest drainage basin and drains about 41% of the contiguous United States into the Gulf of Mexico at an average rate of 470000 cuft/s.\n\n hogs, which destroy native ecosystems – including coastal wetlands – and cause trouble for native species. The delta is a vital stopping point along the Mississippi Flyway. The flyway stretches from southern Ontario to the mouth of the Mississippi River, and contains one of the longest migration routes in the Western Hemisphere. About 460 bird species have been recorded in Louisiana, with 90% (300 species) found within the coastal wetlands. Many diverse and rare species including indigo buntings, scarlet tanagers, yellow-crowned night herons and bald eagles call Louisiana home. Also found in the Mississippi River Delta are great egrets, glossy ibises, roseate spoonbills, wintering hummingbirds, birds of prey and wood storks. \n\nQuestion: What is the mouth of the river which serves as the mouth of the Bumping River?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was a major catastrophe which was said to have killed a third of the population, and Sweden was not to recover fully for three hundred years. The Black Death in Sweden is only mentioned directly in few contemporary documents; in a letter from the king, in a sermon by Saint Bridget of Sweden, in a letter from the city council in Visby to their colleagues in Lübeck, and in a letter from the Pope, replying to a letter from the Swedish king. There is, however, indirect contemporary information, as well as later descriptions of it.\n\n  From Lyon, the plague spread across Burgundy. In the village of Givry in Burgundy, half the population is confirmed to have died in August-November 1348. The Black Death in Paris is described in the famous chronicle of the Carmelite Jean de Venette in the Saint-Denis Abbey in Ille de France outside of Paris. At the time, Paris was the biggest city in Europe, with a population of between 80.000 and 200.000 people. According to Jean de Venette, the plague first arrived to Roissy near Gonesse in June 1348. He claims, that 16.000 people died in Saint-Denis and 800 people daily in Paris between November and December, were 500 died was transported to mass burial each day from \n\nThe bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, had immense historical significance in Europe between 1346 and 1350. During this time, the plague caused a devastating epidemic that resulted in the deaths of approximately 20 million people, which was about a quarter of Europe's population. This epidemic remains the largest recorded tally of fatalities caused by a single epidemic in European history.\n\nThe bubonic plague had a significant impact on the demographic, social, and economic aspects of Europe. The massive loss of life caused by the plague led to a population decline, resulting in a shortage of labor and changes in social structures. With a significant reduction in population, there was a subsequent labor shortage which led to increased wages for those who survived. This shift in economic dynamics had long-lasting effects on European society.\n\nFurthermore, the epidemic also brought about profound psychological and cultural changes. The widespread devastation caused by the Black Death altered people's perceptions of life, death, and religion. It deeply affected religious beliefs and practices, as many turned to religious institutions in search of answers and solace during these dark times. The plague's impact on society can be seen in the art, literature, and religious practices of the time.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, the bubonic plague is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium transmitted through fleas that infest rats. The disease primarily affects rodents, but when infected fleas are forced to seek alternative hosts, such as humans, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause severe symptoms. The characteristic swollen lymph nodes, known as buboes, appear in the neck, groin, or armpit area. The plague had devastating effects, killing approximately two-thirds of those infected within days.\n\nOverall, the bubonic plague's historical significance in Europe between 1346 and 1350 lies in its immense death toll, demographic changes, social and economic impacts, as well as its profound influence on cultural and religious aspects of society.\n\n The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices for the remainder of the medieval period.\n\n The population decline caused by the Black Death resulted in smaller taxes and smaller income for the elite, and a smaller work force who demanded better salary and better conditions from the elite, who reacted to the demands by repression and violence toward their work force. In parallel, the dissolution of law and order in the countryside during the plague became long-lasting when unemployed mercenaries, known as the Condottiero, took control of the countryside population. The Black Death in Italy came to have great importance for the development of modern quarantine law, health authorities and hospitals in Europe.

The last epidemic of bubonic plague in France was the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720.\n\n  The Black Death was present in France between 1347 and 1352. The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others. The Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe. The Black Death in France was described by eyewitnesses such as Louis Heyligen, Jean de Venette and Gilles Li Muisis. The Black Death migrated from Southern France to Spain, from Eastern France to the Holy Roman Empire, and to England by ship from Gascony. At the time, Pope Clement VI resided in Avignon in present-day France during the Western Schism, and issued his condemnations of the Jewish persecutions during the Black Death as well as the flagellants. During the Black Death in France, King Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to compose the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic.\n\n  From Lyon, the plague spread across Burgundy.

It is estimated to have occurred between 1347 and 1351. During this time, the plague swept over these regions and caused a significant impact on the population. It is estimated that approximately one-fourth to one-third of the population was killed by the plague during this period.\n\nFollowing the initial outbreak, periodic epidemics of the plague continued to decimate these populations for the next two-and-a-half centuries. The impact of the plague on the population was profound, leading to a significant reduction in the overall population of Europe and the Near East.\n\nIt is important to note that there were also other epidemics during this period. In the sixteenth century, new diseases such as syphilis and the \"English sweat\" emerged and were widespread in Europe. These epidemics, along with the recurring outbreaks of the bubonic plague, further contributed to the devastation of the population.\n\nOverall, the bubonic plague had a major and lasting impact on the population of Europe and the Near East during the Renaissance and subsequent centuries.

It was filmed on location in Martha's Vineyard, at her home and in the surrounding woods. The video received moderate airplay on MTV in the autumn of 1983. Simon also filmed a music video for the title track, \"Hello Big Man\", which features photos and film footage of her parents. Simon's mother appears at the end of the video. The video also includes the American actor/singer Al Corley, who had also been featured on the cover of Simon's previous album Torch, and with whom Simon had a brief romance.

The video ends with the man choosing to live, and reconciling with his girlfriend when Billy Joel plays \"Piano Man\" once again before giving him his harmonica. One of the extras in the music video is Adam Savage, who later gained fame as the co-host of the popular science television show MythBusters. The video was shot on Staten Island and Manhattan and features landmarks such as the 59th Street Bridge and Monsignor Farrell High School.\n\n Shot in various landscapes, it starts off with the band performing on a boat on a river; the band members are filmed from different angles whilst performing. Following a time lapse sequence (implying passage of time), Felix Riebl (the lead singer) jumps off the boat into a vast sandy desert. Initially, from a long camera shot, the large boat in the background for several seconds is seen, followed by the band members relaxing in a canoe lying on sand, with Harry James Angus playing trumpet whilst Riebl walks by. The next sequence shows Riebl commence singing as he continues to walk, passing by the other band members as they relax on a couch with bassist Ryan Monro resting on the sand next to the couch. In the last scene of the song, all the band members are performing once again, this time on the sand.

The entire video pays homage to It's a Wonderful Life, as the angelic Joel shows a suicidal young man threatening to jump off a bridge because of a break-up with his girlfriend, what life will be like without him, as his family and friends mourn his death - as well as showing him the joys in his future he'll be missing if he dies (e.g. high school graduation, marriage). The video ends with the man choosing to live, and reconciling with his girlfriend when Billy Joel plays \"Piano Man\" once again before giving him his harmonica. One of the extras in the music video is Adam Savage, who later gained fame as the co-host of the popular science television show MythBusters. The video was shot on Staten Island and Manhattan and features landmarks such as the 59th Street Bridge and Monsignor Farrell High School.\n\n The music video is a documentary filmed on a simple DV-camera by the director Adam Berg (brother of lead singer Joakim Berg). It features guitarist Harri Mänty as he travels to Las Vegas to gamble the entire video budget of 300,000 kronor (roughly 50,000 USD) on the roulette. He puts the money on black, and wins.

It was shot at the Hackney Empire in the London Borough of Hackney and directed by Alexander Hemming.

In his Wealth of Nations Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. This concept has been quoted out of context by later economists as the invisible hand of the market. Smith also advanced property rights and personal civil liberties, including stopping slavery, which today partly form the basic liberal ideology. He was also opposed to stock-holding companies, what today is called a \"corporation\", because he predicated the self-policing of the free market upon the free association of moral individuals.\n\n Adam Smith (baptized  1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also known as or  he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell.

Even in Peninsular Malaysia, however, there is an oversupply of electricity, with Tenaga Nasional Berhad being locked into unfavourable purchasing agreements with Independent Power Producers. The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to Peninsular Malaysia. This plan envisioned 730 km \n\n The dam site is in the Myaing Gyi Ngu area of the Hlaing Bwe Township in Myanmar's Karen State. It is 33 kilometers downstream of the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers, and about 47 kilometers from the Thai-Myanmar border. It is opposite Mae Hong Son Province in northern Thailand. The portion of the Salween at which the dam will be built features particularly strong rapids, which in the dry season become a waterfall. The dam site is also within the Kahilu Wildlife Sanctuary. The areas surrounding the Hatgyi Dam site are ethnically diverse and ecologically rich. At least 13 different indigenous groups live along the Salween river, and over ten million people are supported by the Salween River basin. The Salween's waters are nutrient-rich and support local vegetation and farmlands.\n\n (Koica), and the Philippines, through the National Irrigation Administration and the local government of Isabela. The project entailed construction of a 34-meter high earth-filled dam across Pasa River, a reservoir with an active storage of 3.90 million cubic meters, with 5.93 kilometers of a main canal and 16.20 kilometers of lateral canals. According to authorities and government officials, the project is said to be under South Korea's five-year program under the East Asia Climate Change Partnership to address climate change and to bolster Green Growth in Asia. It was built to help mitigate floods with its small water impounding or catchment basin \n\n Banasura Sagar Dam, which impounds the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabini River, is part of the Indian Banasurasagar Project consisting of a dam and a canal project started in 1979. The goal of the project is to support the Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and satisfy the demand for irrigation and drinking water in a region known to have water shortages in seasonal dry periods. The dam is also known as Kuttiyadi Augmentation Main Earthen Dam. The dam has a height of 38.5 m and length of 685 m. In the dam's reservoir there is a set of islands that were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas. The islands with the Banasura hills are in the background view. It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of \n\n The Pa Sak River (แม่น้ำป่าสัก,, , Pronunciation) is a river in central Thailand. The river originates in the Phetchabun Mountains, Dan Sai District, Loei Province, and passes through Phetchabun Province as the backbone of the province. It then passes through the eastern part of Lopburi Province and Saraburi Province, until it joins the Lopburi River northeast of Ayutthaya Island, before it runs into the Chao Phraya River southeast of Ayutthaya near Phet Fortress. It has a length of 513 km and drains a watershed of 16,291 km². The annual discharge is 2.4 km3. The valley of the Pa Sak through the Phetchabun mountains is a dominant feature of Phetchabun Province. Water levels vary seasonally. To address drought problems in the lower Pa Sak valley, in 1994 the construction of the Pa Sak Cholasit Dam (เขื่อนป่าสักชลสิทธิ์) in Lopburi Province was built. The 4860 m wide and 36.5 m high dam retains 0.785 km3 of water. The dam also supplies about 6.7 MW of electricity.\n\nQuestion: For what river does the river on which Pa Sak Jolasid Dam is located serve as the mouth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
